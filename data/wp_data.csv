"Deposit Convexity, Monetary Policy and Financial Stability","Emily Greenwald, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and Joshua Younger","In principle, bank deposits can be withdrawn on demand. In practice, depositors tend to maintain stable balances for long periods, allowing banks to fund long-dated assets. Nevertheless, the cost of deposit funding influences banks’ capacity for maturity transformation. Banks and researchers conventionally model the response of deposit interest rates to market interest rates as constant, implying that deposits have nearly constant duration. Contrary to this standard assumption, we show empirically that the “beta” of deposit rates to market rates increases as market rates rise, causing the duration of deposits to fall. The amount of duration risk delivered to bank balance sheets via this channel from March 2022 to September 2023 is comparable in magnitude to the amount of duration risk absorbed by each of the several large-scale asset purchase programs the Federal Reserve has undertaken since 2008. Dynamic betas present a significant challenge to bank portfolio hedgers by introducing large and dynamic risks that are difficult to model and impractical to replicate on the asset side of the balance sheet. As a result, deposit convexity amplifies monetary policy transmission and increases financial fragility, mechanisms that recent banking stresses have highlighted.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2023/wp2315.pdf,2315,22-Mar,FED-DALLAS,3/1/2022
Assessing the Relative Progressivity of the Biden Administration’s Federal Student Loan Forgiveness Proposal,"Jacob Goss, Daniel Mangrum, and Joelle W. Scally","We quantify the total stock of balances eligible for the Biden Administration’s student loan forgiveness policy announced and examine which groups benefit most. Up to $442 billion in loans are eligible. Those benefiting most are younger, have lower credit scores, and live in lower- and middle-income neighborhoods. We also find that Black and Hispanic borrowers disproportionately benefit from the proposal. We then compare the distribution of beneficiaries for the announced policy to several alternative hypothetical forgiveness proposals and three existing tax credits. The additional forgiveness for Pell grant recipients increased the progressivity of the policy at a cost of $129 billion. Reducing the income eligibility criterion in half from the announced policy would have reduced the cost by nearly $100 billion and made the policy more progressive. Compared to existing tax credits, the announced forgiveness policy is less progressive than the Earned Income Tax Credit but more progressive than the 2019 Child Tax Credit and higher education tax credits. We conclude by describing the remaining federal portfolio if the policy is implemented, and we summarize current credit conditions for federal borrowers. Rising credit card and auto delinquencies for borrowers with paused payments foreshadow future credit difficulties for borrowers if federal loan payments resume without relief.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1046,1046,1/3/2023,FED-NEWYORK,1/3/2023
"Financial Sanctions, SWIFT, and the Architecture of the International Payments System","Marco Cipriani, Linda S. Goldberg, and Gabriele La Spada","Financial sanctions, alongside economic sanctions, are components of the toolkit used by governments as part of international diplomacy. The use of sanctions, especially financial, has increased over the last seventy years. Financial sanctions have been particularly important whenever the goals of the sanctioning countries were related to democracy and human rights. Financial sanctions restrict entities—countries, businesses, or even individuals—from purchasing or selling financial assets, or from accessing custodial or other financial services. They can be imposed on a sanctioned entity’s ability to access the infrastructures that are in place to execute international payments, irrespective of whether such payments underpin financial or real activity. This article explains how financial sanctions can be designed to limit access to the international payments system and, in particular, the SWIFT network, and provides some recent examples.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1047,1047,1/6/2023,FED-NEWYORK,1/6/2023
Does the Community Reinvestment Act Improve Consumers’ Access to Credit?,"Jacob  Conway, Jack N. Glaser, and Matthew C. Plosser","We study the impact of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) on access to consumer credit since 1999 using an individual-level panel and three distinct identification strategies: a regression discontinuity design centered on a CRA-eligibility cutoff; a comparison of neighboring census blocks; and an event study of changes in eligibility. All three rule out a significant effect of the CRA on consumer borrowing. We show that this is in part explained by a shift in mortgages from nonbanks, which are free from CRA obligations, to banks in need of CRA-eligible mortgages. Our findings underscore the pitfalls of a circumscribed regulatory regime.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1048,1048,1/17/2023,FED-NEWYORK,1/17/2023
Stagflation and Topsy-Turvy Capital Flows,"Julien Bengui, Louphou Coulibaly","Are unregulated capital flows excessive during a stagflation episode? We argue that they likely are, owing to a macroeconomic externality operating through the economy’s supply side. Inflows raise domestic wages through a wealth effect on labor supply and cause unwelcome upward pressure on marginal costs in countries where monetary policy is trying to drive down costs to stabilize inflation. Yet, market forces are likely to generate such inflows. Optimal capital flow management instead requires net outflows, suggesting topsy-turvy capital flows following markup shocks.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/working-papers/stagflation-and-topsyturvy-capital-flows,795,26-Jan-23,FED-MINNEAPOLIS,1/26/2023
Averaging Impulse Responses Using Prediction Pools,"Paul Ho, Thomas A. Lubik and Christian Matthes","Macroeconomists construct impulse responses using many competing time series models and different statistical paradigms (Bayesian or frequentist). We adapt optimal linear prediction pools to efficiently combine impulse response estimators for the effects of the same economic shock from this vast class of possible models. We thus alleviate the need to choose one specific model, obtaining weights that are typically positive for more than one model. Three Monte Carlo simulations and two monetary shock empirical applications illustrate how the weights leverage the strengths of each model by (i) trading off properties of each model depending on variable, horizon, and application and (ii) accounting for the full predictive distribution rather than being restricted to specific moments.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-04,23-04,27-Jan-23,FED-RICHMOND,1/27/2023
Sparse Trend Estimation,"Richard K. Crump, Nikolay Gospodinov, and Hunter Wieman","The low-frequency movements of many economic variables play a prominent role in policy analysis and decision-making. We develop a robust estimation approach for these slow-moving trend processes, which is guided by a judicious choice of priors and is characterized by sparsity. We present some novel stylized facts from longer-run survey expectations that inform the structure of the estimation procedure. The general version of the proposed Bayesian estimator with a slab-and-spike prior accounts explicitly for cyclical dynamics. The practical implementation of the method is discussed in detail, and we show that it performs well in simulations against some relevant benchmarks. We report empirical estimates of trend growth for U.S. output (and its components), productivity, and annual mean temperature. These estimates allow policymakers to assess shortfalls and overshoots in these variables from their economic and ecological targets.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1049,1049,2/1/2023,FED-NEWYORK,2/1/2023
Quantifying the Inflationary Impact of Fiscal Stimulus under Supply Constraints,"Julian di Giovanni, Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan, Alvaro Silva, and Muhammed A.  Yıldırım","This paper builds on Baqaee and Farhi (2022) and di Giovanni et al. (2022) to quantify the contribution of fiscal policy to U.S. inflation over the December 2019-June 2022 period. Model calibrations show that aggregate demand shocks explain roughly two-thirds of total model-based inflation, and that the fiscal stimulus contributed half or more of the total aggregate demand effect.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1050,1050,2/2/2023,FED-NEWYORK,2/2/2023
A Theory of Fear of Floating,"Javier Bianchi, Louphou Coulibaly","Many central banks whose exchange rate regimes are classified as flexible are reluctant to let the exchange rate fluctuate. This phenomenon is known as “fear of floating”. We present a simple theory in which fear of floating emerges as an optimal policy outcome. The key feature of the model is an occasionally binding borrowing constraint linked to the exchange rate that introduces a feedback loop between aggregate demand and credit conditions. Contrary to the Mundellian paradigm, we show that a depreciation can be contractionary, and letting the exchange rate float can expose the economy to self-fulfilling crises.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/working-papers/a-theory-of-fear-of-floating,796,3-Feb-23,FED-MINNEAPOLIS,2/3/2023
International Capital Flow Pressures and Global Factors,Linda S. Goldberg and Signe Krogstrup,"The risk sensitivity of international capital flow pressures is explored using a new Exchange Market Pressure index that combines pressures observed in exchange rate adjustments with model-based estimates of incipient pressures that are masked by foreign exchange interventions and policy rate adjustments. The sensitivity of capital flow pressures to risk sentiment, including for so-called safe-haven currencies, evolves over time, varies significantly across countries, and differs between normal times and extreme stress events. Across countries, risk sensitivities and safe-haven status are associated with self-fulfilling exchange rate expectations and carry trade funding currencies. In contrast, association with more traditional macroeconomic country characteristics is weak.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1051,1051,2/6/2023,FED-NEWYORK,2/6/2023
The Bitcoin–Macro Disconnect,Gianluca Benigno and Carlo Rosa,"This paper investigates the link between Bitcoin and macroeconomic fundamentals by estimating the impact of macroeconomic news on Bitcoin using an event study with intraday data. The key result is that, unlike other U.S. asset classes, Bitcoin is orthogonal to monetary and macroeconomic news. This disconnect is puzzling as unexpected changes in discount rates should, in principle, affect the price of Bitcoin even when interpreting Bitcoin as a purely speculative asset.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1052,1052,2/7/2023,FED-NEWYORK,2/7/2023
Got Milk? The Effect of Export Price Shocks on Exchange Rates,Hillary Stein,"I examine the effect of exogenous terms of trade shocks on an exchange rate by turning to New Zealand’s dairy auctions. Dairy is New Zealand’s largest export category, making up almost 20 percent of exports. Specifically, whole milk powder accounts for 6 to 11 percent of total exports, and its price is determined in twice-monthly auctions. I use event studies to quantify the impact of surprise auction results on the New Zealand dollar on a high-frequency basis. I find that a 1 percent increase in whole milk powder prices has a modest, but nevertheless significant, effect on the nominal exchange rate that does not seem to be explained by interest rate movements. Rather, the effect seems to be driven by a combination of two channels: a financial flows channel and a fundamental channel. The methodology developed here can potentially be applied to other commodity exporters.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/got-milk-the-effect-of-export-price-shocks-on-exchange-rates,23-1,9-Feb-23,FED-BOSTON,2/9/2023
Is the Green Transition Inflationary?,"Marco Del Negro, Julian di Giovanni, and Keshav Dogra","We develop a multi-sector New Keynesian model to analyze the inflationary effects of climate policies. Climate policies need not be inflationary, but can generate an inflation-output tradeoff whose size depends on how flexible prices are in the “dirty” and “green” sectors relative to the rest of the economy, and on whether climate policies consist of taxes or subsidies. A quantitative version of the model calibrated to U.S. data on input-output linkages and sectoral heterogeneity in emissions and price stickiness suggests that an increase in carbon taxes would generate a sizable tradeoff: containing the impact on headline or core inflation would lead to a deep recession. But while sizeable, the tradeoff is relatively short-lived as it wanes after one year.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1053,1053,2/9/2023,FED-NEWYORK,2/9/2023
Market-Function Asset Purchases,Darrell Duffie and Frank M. Keane,"This paper investigates the goals, costs, and benefits of official-sector purchases of government securities for the purpose of restoring market functionality. We explore the design of market-function purchase programs, including their communication, triggers, operational protocols, exit, and wind-down strategies. We further discuss whether, under some circumstances, fiscal buybacks might be a useful alternative or complement to central-bank market-function purchase programs, and how these buybacks could be funded. The use of fiscal buybacks to support market functionality can be aligned with the fiscal authority’s goal of minimizing the government’s interest expense and can reduce challenges that can be faced by a central bank when asset purchases are not naturally congruent with monetary policy. Depending on the setting and circumstances, fiscal buybacks can also mitigate perceptions of risks to the central bank’s independence.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1054,1054,2/20/2023,FED-NEWYORK,2/20/2023
Noncognitive Skills at the Time of COVID-19: An Experiment with Professional Traders and Students,"Marco Angrisani, Marco Cipriani, Antonio  Guarino, Ryan Kendall, and Julen Ortiz de Zarate Pina","We study the stability of noncognitive skills by comparing experimental results gathered before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a sample of professional traders, we find a significant decrease in agreeableness and locus of control and a moderate decrease in grit. These patterns are primarily driven by those with more negative experiences of the pandemic. Other skills, such as trust, conscientiousness, and self-monitoring, are unchanged. We contrast these results with those from a sample of undergraduate students whose noncognitive skills remain constant (except conscientiousness). Our findings provide evidence against the stability of noncognitive skills, particularly among professional traders.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1055,1055,2/21/2023,FED-NEWYORK,2/21/2023
Workers’ Perceptions of Earnings Growth and Employment Risk,Gizem Kosar and Wilbert  van der Klaauw,"In addition to realized earnings and employment shocks, forward-looking individuals are presumed to condition their consumption and labor supply decisions on their subjective beliefs about future labor market risks. This paper analyzes these perceptions of earnings and employment risks using rich monthly panel data. It documents considerable individual heterogeneity in expected earnings growth and earnings growth uncertainty and in the perceived likelihood of a voluntary and involuntary job exit. We examine how these expectations evolve over the working life and the business cycle, and how they co-vary with expectations about the macro economy. Our analysis provides novel evidence on the perceived persistence in earnings growth shocks and on the association between future earnings and spending growth.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1056,1056,2/24/2023,FED-NEWYORK,2/24/2023
Why Are the Wealthiest So Wealthy?

At age 50, the excess wealth of the top 0.1%, relative to mid-wealth households, is accounted for by higher saving rates (34%), initial wealth (32%), and higher returns (27%), while higher labor income (5%) and inheritances (1%) account for the residual. One-fourth of the wealthiest—the “New Money”—start with negative wealth but experience rapid wealth growth early in life. Relative to the “Old Money”, the New Money are characterized by even higher saving rates and returns, and also by higher labor income.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-004,2023-004C,23-Mar,FED-STLOUIS,3/1/2023
Heterogeneous Agents Dynamic Spatial General Equilibrium,Maximiliano A. Dvorkin,"I develop a dynamic model of migration and labor market choice with incomplete markets and uninsurable income risk to quantify the effects of international trade on workers’ employment reallocation, earnings, and wealth. Macroeconomic conditions in different labor markets and idiosyncratic shocks shape agents’ labor market choices, consumption, earnings, and asset accumulation over time. Despite the rich heterogeneity, the model is highly tractable as the optimal consumption, labor supply, capital accumulation, and migration and reallocation decisions of individual workers across different markets have closed-form expressions and can be aggregated. I study the asymmetric impact of international trade on the evolution of employment, earnings, and wealth, and decompose the frictions workers face to reallocate across U.S. sectors and regions into those with a transitory effect and those with long-lasting consequences.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-005,2023-005A,23-Mar,FED-STLOUIS,3/1/2023
House Prices and Rents in the 21st Century,Lara Loewenstein and Paul S. Willen,"We study the joint evolution of prices and rents of residential property. After constructing rent and price indices for renter- and owner-occupied properties, we decompose the change in the price of occupant-owned property into (1) changes in rent, (2) changes in the relative prices of investor- and occupant-owned properties, and (3) changes in the price-rent ratio. Via a simple model, we link our decomposition to different sources of variation in house prices. We argue that while the 2000s boom was plausibly driven by exuberant expectations, the boom of the 2020s more likely resulted from a preference shock.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/house-prices-and-rents-in-the-21st-century,23-2,3-Mar-23,FED-BOSTON,3/3/2023
To What Degree and through Which Channel Do Central Banks Other Than the Federal Reserve Cause Spillovers?,Christopher D. Cotton,"Spillovers play a crucial role in driving monetary policy around the world. The literature focuses predominantly
on spillovers from the Federal Reserve. Less attention has been paid to spillovers from other central banks. I measure the degree to which 20 central banks cause spillovers. I show that central banks in medium- to high-income countries cause spillovers to medium- to long-term interest rates in similar countries through a bond-pricing channel. These effects are narrower than spillovers from the Federal Reserve, which also affect emerging markets, short-term interest rates, and other assets. However, they are still pronounced. Fourteen central banks other than the Federal Reserve cause significant spillovers: the central banks of Australia, Canada, Czechia, the eurozone, Japan, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Consequently, the Federal Reserve causes only one-fifth of the spillovers to 10-year interest rates, and the United States is the recipient of large spillovers. My results imply that central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, are affected by greater spillovers than is commonly believed, and that non-Fed central banks cause spillovers through a bond-pricing channel.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/to-what-degree-and-through-which-channel-do-central-banks-cause-spillovers,23-3,3-Mar-23,FED-BOSTON,3/3/2023
Non-Bank Financial Institutions and Banks’ Fire-Sale Vulnerabilities,"Nicola Cetorelli, Mattia  Landoni, and Lina Lu","Banks carry significant exposures to nonbanks from direct dealings, but they can also be exposed, indirectly, through losses in asset values resulting from fire-sale events. We assess the vulnerability of U.S. banks to fire sales potentially originating from any of twelve separate nonbank segments and identify network-like externalities driven by the interconnectedness across nonbank types in terms of asset holdings. We document that such network externalities can contribute to very large multiples of an original fire sale, thus suggesting that conventional assessments of fire-sale vulnerabilities can be grossly understated and highlighting the value of treating nonbank financial institutions as one organic whole for monitoring purposes.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1057,1057,3/9/2023,FED-NEWYORK,3/9/2023
Climate Defaults and Financial Adaptation,Toan Phan  and Felipe F. Schwartzman,"We analyze the relationship between climate-related disasters and sovereign debt crises using a model with capital accumulation, sovereign default, and disaster risk. We find that disaster risk and default risk together lead to slow post-disaster recovery and heightened borrowing costs. Calibrating the model to Mexico, we find that the increase in cyclone risk due to climate change leads to a welfare loss equivalent to a permanent 1% consumption drop. However, financial adaptation via catastrophe bonds and disaster insurance can reduce these losses by about 25%. Our study highlights the importance of financial frictions in analyzing climate change impacts.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-06,23-06,28-Mar-23,FED-RICHMOND,3/28/2023
On the Economic Mechanics of Warfare,Guillaume Vandenbroucke,"The literature on war deals with finances, causes, or consequences. But, how do war-related expenditures affect economically-relevant outcomes at a war’s conclusion (e.g., prevailing side, duration, and casualties)? I present a model of attrition and characterize the effects of GDP at a military conclusion (one side cannot fight anymore) and a political conclusion (one side quits). The estimated model fits the data for the battle of Iwo Jima well.

"Theodore Roosevelt, the Election of 1912, and the Founding of the Federal Reserve",Matthew Jaremski and David C. Wheelock,"This paper examines how the election of 1912 changed the makeup of Congress and led to the Federal Reserve Act. The decision of Theodore Roosevelt and other Progressives to run as third-party candidates split the Republican Party and enabled Democrats to capture the White House and Congress. We show that the election produced a less polarized Congress and that new members were more likely to support the Act. Absent the Republican split, Republicans would likely have held the White House and Congress, and enactment of legislation to establish a central bank would have been unlikely or certainly quite different.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-008,2023-008A,23-Apr,FED-STLOUIS,4/1/2023
U.S. Banks’ Exposures to Climate Transition Risks,"Hyeyoon Jung, João A.C. Santos, and Lee Seltzer","We find that banks’ credit exposures to transition risks are modest. We build on the estimated sectoral effects of climate transition policies from general equilibrium models. Even when we consider the strictest policies or the most adverse scenarios, exposures do not exceed 14 percent of banks’ loan portfolios. We also find that commonly used carbon emissions can explain at most 60 percent of bank exposures estimated off general equilibrium models. Moreover, we find evidence of bank management of transition risk exposures. Banks that signed the Net-Zero Alliance have reduced their exposures compared to non-signatories, mainly by cutting lending to the riskiest industries.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1058,1058,4/6/2023,FED-NEWYORK,4/6/2023
Climate Stress Testing,"Viral V.

We review the climate stress scenarios currently employed by regulators, highlighting the need to (i) consider many transition risks as dynamic policy choices; (ii) better understand and incorporate feedback loops between climate change and the economy; and (iii) further explore “compound risk” scenarios in which climate risks co-occur with other risks. We discuss how the process of mapping climate stress scenarios into financial firm outcomes can incorporate existing evidence on the effects of various climate-related risks on credit and market outcomes. We argue that more research is required to (i) identify channels through which plausible scenarios can lead to meaningful short-run impact on credit risks, given typical bank loan maturities; (ii) incorporate bank-lending responses to climate risks; (iii) assess the adequacy of climate risk pricing in financial markets; and (iv) better understand how market participants form climate risk expectations and how this affects financial stability.

Debt Maturity and Commitment on Firm Policies,Andrea Gamba and Alessio Saretto,"If firms can issue debt only at discrete dates, debt maturity is an effective device against the commitment problem on debt and investment policies. With shorter maturities, debt dynamics are less persistent and more valuable because upward leverage adjustments are faster and long-run leverage lower. Debt maturities that are relatively shorter than asset maturities increase marginal q, and reduce underinvestment. A decomposition of the credit spread consistent with equilibrium shows that the component due to the commitment problem on future debt issuances is sizeable when leverage and default risk are low, and is lower for shorter maturity.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2023/wp2303.pdf,2303,10-Apr-23,FED-DALLAS,4/10/2023

Estimating Macroeconomic News and Surprise Shocks,"Lutz Kilian, Michael D. Plante and Alexander W.

This paper examines the ability of the state-of-the-art VAR approach in Kurmann and Sims (2021) to identify responses to TFP news shocks and possibly surprise shocks in theory and practice. When applied to data generated from conventional New Keynesian DSGE models with shock processes that match key TFP moments, this estimator tends to be strongly biased, both in the presence of TFP measurement error and in its absence. This bias worsens in realistically small samples, and the estimator becomes highly variable. Incorporating a direct measure of TFP news into the VAR model (and adapting the identification strategy accordingly) substantially reduces the bias and RMSE of the impulse responses, regardless of whether there is TFP measurement error.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2023/wp2304r1.pdf,2304,16-Apr-23,FED-DALLAS,4/16/2023
A Theory of Net Capital Flows over the Global Financial Cycle,J. Scott Davis and Eric van Wincoop,"We develop a theory to account for changes in net capital flows of safe and risky assets over the global financial cycle. We show empirically that countries that have a net debt of safe assets experience a rise in net outflows of safe assets (reduced accumulation of safe debt) during a downturn in the global financial cycle. This is accomplished through a rise in total net outflows and a drop in net outflows of risky assets. We develop a multi-country portfolio choice model that can account for these facts. The theory relies on cross-country heterogeneity in the share of an investor's portfolio invested in risky assets. A global drop in risky asset prices changes relative wealth across countries due to this heterogeneity, which leads to changes in net flows of safe and risky assets. The model is applied to 20 advanced countries and calibrated to reflect observed cross-country heterogeneity of net foreign asset positions of safe and risky assets. The implications of the calibrated model for net capital flows are quantitatively consistent with the data.",https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/international/wpapers/2023/0420.pdf,GI420,19-Apr-23,FED-DALLAS,4/19/2023
Optimal Dynamic Tax-Transfer Policies in Heterogeneous-Agents Economies,YiLi Chien and Yi Wen,"In the design of an optimal tax-transfer system, there are two complementary conventional wisdoms: the labor-efficiency argument and the debt-efficiency argument. The former emphasizes the trade-off between redistribution and distortions in the labor market, while the latter emphasizes the trade-off between gains from monopoly rents and distortions in the asset market. We use an analytically tractable infinite-horizon model with both ex-ante and ex-post heterogeneity to show that neither argument is complete in the design of the tax-transfer system. Instead, in Aiyagari-type models the optimal system should be determined at the point where the intertemporal wedge between the market interest rate and the time discount rate is completely eliminated, provided that the government fiscal space permits an interior Ramsey steady state. Otherwise the optimal labor tax rate approaches 100% regardless of the Pareto weight distribution in the social welfare function.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-009,2023-009A,23-May,FED-STLOUIS,5/1/2023
Pandemic labor force participation and net worth fluctuations,Miguel Faria e Castro and Samuel Jordan-Wood,"The U.S. labor force participation rate (LFPR) experienced a record drop during the early pandemic. While it has since recovered to 62.2% as of December 2022, it was still 1.41 pp below its pre-pandemic peak. This gap is explained mostly by a permanent decline in the LFPR for workers older than 55. This paper argues that wealth effects driven by the historically high returns in major asset classes such as stocks and housing may have influenced these trends. Combining an estimated model of wealth effects on labor supply with micro data on balance sheet composition, we show that changes in net worth caused by realized returns explain half of the drop in LFPR in the 2020-21 period and over 80% of ""excess retirements'' during the same period.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-010,2023-010A,23-May,FED-STLOUIS,5/1/2023
Firm Exit and Liquidity: Evidence from the Great Recession,Fernando Leibovici and David Wiczer,"This paper studies the role of credit constraints in accounting for the dynamics of firm exit during the Great Recession. We present novel firm-level evidence on the role of credit constraints on exit behavior during the Great Recession. Firms in financial distress, with tighter access to credit, are more likely to default than firms with more access to credit. This difference widened substantially in the Great Recession while, in contrast, default rates did not vary much by size, age, or productivity.

"Time Averaging Meets Labor Supplies of Heckman, Lochner, and Taber","Sebastian Graves, Victoria Gregory, Lars Ljungqvist, and Thomas J. Sargent","We incorporate time-averaging into the canonical model of Heckman, Lochner, and Taber (1998) (HLT) to study retirement decisions, government policies, and their interaction with the aggregate labor supply elasticity. The HLT model forced all agents to retire at age 65, while our model allows them to choose career lengths. A benchmark social security system puts all of our workers at corner solutions of their career-length choice problems and lets our model reproduce HLT model outcomes. But alternative tax and social security arrangements dislodge some agents from those corners, bringing associated changes in equilibrium prices and human capital accumulation decisions. A reform that links social security benefits to age but not to employment status eliminates the implicit tax on working beyond 65. High taxes with revenues returned lump-sum keep agents off corner solutions, raising the aggregate labor supply elasticity and threatening to bring about a “dual labor market” in which many people decide not to supply labor.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-012,2023-012A,23-May,FED-STLOUIS,5/1/2023

We find that news in central bankers’ speeches can help explain volatility and tail risk in both equity and bond markets. We also find that markets attend to these signals more closely during abnormal GDP and inflation regimes. Our results challenge the conventional view that central bank communication primarily resolves uncertainty.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-013,2023-013A,23-May,FED-STLOUIS,5/1/2023
Consumption Zones,"Andrea Batch, Benjamin R. Bridgman, Abe C. Dunn, Mahsa Gholizadeh","Local area data are important to many economic questions, but most local area data are reported using political units, such as counties, which often do not match economic units, such as product markets. Commuting zones (CZs) group counties into local labor markets. However, CZs are not the most appropriate grouping for other economic activities. We introduce consumption zones (ConZs), groupings of counties appropriate for the analysis of household consumption. We apply the CZ methodology to payment card data, which report spending flows across U.S. counties for 15 retail and service industries. We find that different industries have different market sizes. Grocery stores have more than five times the number of ConZs as live entertainment. Industries with more frequent purchases are more local than those with infrequent purchases. We apply ConZs to measuring industry concentration. ConZs give lower concentration levels than counties, with the largest gap for infrequent purchase industries. The difference is economically important. Some industries are below the antitrust enforcement thresholds with ConZs but above them for counties. We further demonstrate the importance of ConZs by analyzing the proposed merger of Albertsons and Kroger.",https://www.bea.gov//research/papers/2023/consumption-zones,WP2023-3,5/4/2023,BEA,5/4/2023
The Economic Impact of a Casino Monopoly: Evidence from Atlantic City,Adam Scavette,"New Jersey voters approved legalized gambling for Atlantic City in a 1976 referendum, making it the second state after Nevada in 1931. The state explicitly leveraged the city's regional monopoly, which it held from 1978 through 1992, on casinos east of the Mississippi River as an economic development strategy to revive the blighted seaside resort town. The literature on the economic development effects of casinos suggests that sparsely populated areas without nearby competing gambling venues tend to benefit the most. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I model the economic impact of casino legalization on the Atlantic City Metropolitan Area (Atlantic County, NJ) across five-, ten-, and fifteen-year treatment horizons. I find a significant positive impact of legalized casinos on personal income and housing prices for only the five-year treatment horizon, and significant positive impacts for payroll employment and wages across all three treatment horizons.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-07,23-07,4-May-23,FED-RICHMOND,5/4/2023
The Returns to Government R&D: Evidence from U.S. Appropriations Shocks,Andrew J.

We structurally estimate the production function elasticity of nondefense government R&D capital using the SP-IV methodology of Lewis and Mertens (2023) and obtain implied returns of 150 to 300 percent over the postwar period.

Unemployment Insurance when the Wealth Distribution Matters,"Facundo Piguillem, Hernán Ruffo and Nicholas Trachter","This paper analyzes the welfare effects of unemployment insurance in a life-cycle model, focusing on partial vs. general equilibrium effects. We study an OLG economy with learning-by-doing human capital accumulation. Agents can be employed or unemployed. While unemployed agents costly search for new jobs. We calibrate the model to the U.S. economy, and find that replacement ratio and potential duration are close to the current one. But, in contrast with the previous literature, we find that the optimal policies under general and partial equilibrium are almost the same. Through a series of exercises we conclude that the life-cycle model provides two key components, crucial for welfare evaluation: it emphasizes workers' insurance needs by accurately reproducing the left tail of the wealth distribution, and generates a realistic response of precautionary savings to transfers.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-08,23-08,5-May-23,FED-RICHMOND,5/5/2023
Personality Traits and Financial Outcomes,"Claire Greene, Oz Shy, and Joanna Stavins","The Big Five personality traits—openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism—are widely used in understanding human behavior. Using data collected from a survey and diary of consumer payment choice, we investigate how the Big Five traits affect three financial outcomes: being unbanked, holding a credit card, and carrying credit card debt. Although each personality trait is correlated with each of the financial outcomes we examine, they mostly become statistically insignificant when we control for demographics and income in regressions. Carrying credit card debt (revolving), however, is significantly affected by conscientiousness, openness, and agreeableness: Credit card adopters who are less conscientious, more open to experiences, or more agreeable are significantly more likely to revolve credit card debt. A machine learning algorithm confirms that conscientiousness is the major factor separating revolvers from other credit cardholders.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/personality-traits-and-financial-outcomes,23-4,9-May-23,FED-BOSTON,5/9/2023
Applications or Approvals: What Drives Racial Disparities in the Paycheck Protection Program?,"Sergey Chernenko, Nathan Kaplan, Asani Sarkar, and David Scharfstein","We use the 2020 Small Business Credit Survey to study the sources of racial disparities in use of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Black-owned firms are 8.9 percentage points less likely than observably similar white-owned firms to receive PPP loans. About 55 percent of this take-up disparity is attributable to a disparity in application propensity, while the remainder is attributable to a disparity in approval rates. The finding in prior research that Black-owned PPP recipients are less likely than white-owned recipients to borrow from banks and more likely to borrow from fintech lenders is driven entirely by application behavior. Conditional on applying for a PPP loan, Black-owned firms are 9.9 percentage points less likely than white-owned firms to apply to banks and 7.8 percentage points more likely to apply to fintechs. However, they face similar average approval disparities at banks (7.4 percentage points) and fintechs (8.4 percentage points). Sorting by Black-owned firms away from banks and towards fintechs is significantly stronger in more racially biased counties, and the bank approval disparity is also larger in more racially biased counties. We conclude that insofar as automation by fintechs reduces racial disparities in PPP take-up, it does so by mitigating disparities in loan application rates, not loan approval rates.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1060,1060,5/11/2023,FED-NEWYORK,5/11/2023
Money Matters: Broad Divisia Money and the Recovery of Nominal GDP from the COVID-19 Recession,Michael D. Bordo and John V.

"Working Remotely? Selection, Treatment, and the Market for Remote Work",Natalia Emanuel and Emma Harrington,"How does remote work affect productivity and how productive are workers who choose remote jobs? We estimate both effects in a U.S. Fortune 500 firm’s call centers that employed both remote and on-site workers in the same jobs. Prior to COVID-19, remote workers answered 12 percent fewer calls per hour than on-site workers. When the call centers closed due to COVID-19, the productivity of formerly on-site workers declined by 4 percent relative to already-remote workers, indicating that a third of the initial gap was due to a negative treatment effect of remote work. Yet an 8 percent productivity gap persisted, indicating that the majority of the productivity gap was due to negative worker selection into remote work. Difference-in-differences designs also indicate that remote work degraded call quality— particularly for inexperienced workers—and reduced workers’ promotion rates. In a model of the market provision of remote work, we find that firms were in a prisoner’s dilemma: all firms would have gained from offering comparable remote and on-site jobs, but any individual firm was loathe to attract less productive workers.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1061,1061,5/24/2023,FED-NEWYORK,5/24/2023

Immigration from a terror-prone nation: destination nation’s optimal immigration and counterterrorism policies,"Subhayu Bandyopadhyay, Khusrav Gaibulloev, and Todd Sandler","The paper presents a two-country model in which a destination country chooses its immigration quota and proactive counterterrorism actions in response to immigration from a terror-plagued source country.  After the destination country fixes its two policies, immigrants decide between supplying labor or conducting terrorist attacks, which helps determine equilibrium labor supply and wages.  The analysis accounts for the marginal disutility of lost rights/freedoms stemming from stricter counterterror measures as well the inherent radicalization of migrants.  Comparative statics involve changes to those two parameters.  For example, an enhanced importance attached to lost rights is shown to limit immigration quotas and counterterrorism actions.  In contrast, increased source-country radicalization reduces immigration quotas but has an ambiguous effect on optimal proactive measures.  Extensions involving defensive policies and destination-country citizens radicalization are considered.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-014,2023-014A,23-Jun,FED-STLOUIS,6/1/2023

First, the literature has tended to overlook bubbles and their consequences under the premise that they are hard to detect in real time. We suggest that novel statistical techniques allow us to overcome those prejudices as they provide valuable signals of emerging exuberance in real‐time. Second, monetary policy has been slow to recognize that financial instability arising from bubbles can have adverse effects on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy itself and on the types of risks faced by policymakers. We argue that measuring and monitoring episodes of exuberance in housing—but also in other asset classes—can be useful not just for thinking about macroprudential strategies but also to conduct risk analysis for monetary policy.",https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/international/wpapers/2023/0421.pdf,GI421,1-Jun-23,FED-DALLAS,6/1/2023

High-Yield Debt Covenants and Their Real Effects,"Falk Bräuning, Victoria Ivashina and Ali Ozdagli","High-yield debt, including leveraged loans, features incurrence financial covenants or ""cov-lite"" provisions. These covenants differ from traditional loans' maintenance covenants, as they preserve equity control rights but impose specific restrictions on the borrower after crossing the covenant threshold. Contrary to the prevailing belief that incurrence covenants offer limited protection for creditors, our research reveals a significant and sudden decline in investment upon triggering these covenants.

For What It’s Worth: Measuring Land Value in the Era of Big Data and Machine Learning,"Scott Wentland, Gary Cornwall, Jeremy G. Moulton","This paper develops a new method for valuing land, a key asset on a nation’s balance sheet. The method first employs an unsupervised machine learning method, kmeans clustering, to discretize unobserved heterogeneity, which we then combine with a supervised learning algorithm, gradient boosted trees (GBT), to obtain property-level price predictions and estimates of the land component. Our initial results from a large national dataset show this approach routinely outperforms hedonic regression methods (as used by the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics, for example) in out-of-sample price predictions. To exploit the best of both methods, we further explore a composite approach using model stacking, finding it outperforms all methods in out-of-sample tests and a benchmark test against nearby vacant land sales. In an application, we value residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural land for the entire contiguous U.S. from 2006-2015.

Complementary Currencies and Liquidity: The Case of Coca-Base Money,Cristian Frasser and Lucie Lebeau,"In coca-growing villages of Colombia, where pesos are scarce, coca-base is not only used as the main input for cocaine production—it also acts as a complementary currency (CC), circulating locally as a medium of exchange for day-to-day transactions. This paper provides a clear rationale for the economically-motivated adoption of a CC in a small open economy underprovided with official currency. An equilibrium currency shortage arises endogenously in our model, whereby shocks to the local supply of currency have a real impact on local trade and welfare. We show how a CC can mitigate the underprovision of liquidity and derive general insights relating the CC’s characteristics to its ability to supplement the official currency. In an application, we quantify the unintended consequences of various anti-narcotic policies pursued by the Colombian government on liquidity provision in coca-growing villages and identify the least-harmful policy tools given the policy objectives at stake.

"Global Liquidity: Drivers, Volatility and Toolkits",Linda S. Goldberg,"Global liquidity refers to the volumes of financial flows—largely intermediated through global banks and non-bank financial institutions—that can move at relatively high frequencies across borders. The amplitude of responses to global conditions like risk sentiment, discussed in the context of the global financial cycle, depends on the characteristics and vulnerabilities of the institutions providing funding flows. Evidence from across empirical approaches and using granular data provides policy-relevant lessons. International spillovers of monetary policy and risk sentiment through global liquidity evolve in response to regulation, the characteristics of financial institutions, and actions of official institutions around liquidity provision. Strong prudential policies in the home countries of global banks and official facilities reduce funding strains during stress events. Country-specific policy challenges, summarized by the monetary and financial trilemmas, are partially alleviated. However, risk migration across types of financial intermediaries underscores the importance of advancing regulatory agendas related to non-bank financial institutions.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1064,1064,6/16/2023,FED-NEWYORK,6/16/2023
Capitalizing Data: Case Studies of Tax Forms and Individual Credit Reports,Rachel Soloveichik,"Early papers on capitalizing data focused on complex digital data that are stored on supercomputers and managed by highly skilled computer scientists (Statistics Canada 2019) (Eurostat 2020) (Coyle 2022) (Calderon and Rassier 2022) (Mitchell et al. 2022). This paper studies two very different types of data: tax forms and individual credit reports. Both types of data are simple text records that can be stored on any computer or even on paper (Brenton 1964) and managed by workers with only a high school degree (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2022a) (Weedmark 2021). Despite their simplicity, these two data types are expensive to create. This paper estimates that tax forms had a creation cost of $0.4 trillion in 2017 and individual credit reports had a creation cost of $0.6 trillion in 2017.Historical growth changes noticeably when tax forms and individual credit reports are tracked as long-lived intangible assets. Tax form creation rose rapidly between 1929 and 1950 due to the introduction of Social Security and widespread federal income taxes. As a result, including tax forms increases real gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 1929 and 1950 by 0.12 percentage point per year. In contrast, real credit report creation plummeted in 1970 due to the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). As a result, including individual credit reports decreases real GDP growth in 1970 by 1.6 percentage point. However, neither tax forms nor individual credit reports have much impact on recent GDP growth.",https://www.bea.gov//research/papers/2023/capitalizing-data-case-studies-tax-forms-and-individual-credit-reports,WP2023-7,6/21/2023,BEA,6/21/2023

Stimulus through Insurance: The Marginal Propensity to Repay Debt,"Gizem Kosar, Davide Melcangi, Laura Pilossoph, and David Wiczer","Using detailed micro data, we document that households often use “stimulus” checks to pay down debt, especially those with low net wealth-to-income ratios. To rationalize these patterns, we introduce a borrowing price schedule into an otherwise standard incomplete markets model. Because interest rates rise with debt, borrowers have increasingly larger incentives to use an additional dollar to reduce debt service payments rather than consume. Using our calibrated model, we then study whether and how this marginal propensity to repay debt (MPRD) alters the aggregate implications of fiscal transfers. We uncover a trade-off between stimulus and insurance, as high-debt individuals gain considerably from transfers, but consume relatively little immediately. We show how this mechanism can lower short-run fiscal multipliers but sustain aggregate consumption for longer.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1065,1065,6/26/2023,FED-NEWYORK,6/26/2023

We estimate the time-varying jump intensities of asset prices and introduce a testing approach that identifies multi-asset tail risk based on the release times of scheduled news announcements. Using high-frequency data on individual U.S. stocks and sector-specific ETF portfolios, we find that most of the FOMC announcements create systemic left tail risk, but there is no evidence that macro announcements do so. The magnitude of the tail risk induced by Fed news varies over the business cycle, peaks during the global financial crisis and remains high over different phases of unconventional monetary policy. We use our approach to construct a Fed-induced systemic tail risk (STR) indicator. STR helps explain the pre-FOMC announcement drift and significantly increases variance risk premia, particularly for the meetings without press conferences.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-016,2023-016A,23-Jul,FED-STLOUIS,7/1/2023
Decomposing the Government Transfer Multiplier,"Timothy Conley, Bill Dupor, Rong Li, and Yijiang Zhou","We estimate the local, spillover and aggregate causal effects of government transfers on personal income. We identify exogenous changes in federal transfers to residents at the state-level using legislated social security cost-of-living adjustments between 1952 and 1974.  Each effect is measured as a multiplier: the change in personal income in response to a one unit change in transfers. The local multiplier, i.e., the effect of own-state transfers on own-state income holding fixed other state's income, at a four-quarter horizon is approximately 3.4. The cross-state spillover multiplier is about -0.7, but not statistically different from zero. The aggregate multiplier, i.e., the sum of its local and spillover components, equals 2.7.

Real Wage Growth at the Micro Level,Victoria Gregory and Elisabeth Harding,"This paper investigates patterns in real wage growth in 2022 to determine whether wages have kept up with rising price levels, and how this differs among labor market participants. Using the CPS for wages and imputing expenditure data from the CEX, we measure separately nominal wage growth and inflation rates at the micro level. We find that there is more heterogeneity in the former, meaning that when we combine them, an individual’s real wage growth is primarily driven by their nominal wage growth. In 2022, 57% of individuals experienced negative real wage growth, with older and less educated workers, as well as job-stayers, being hit the hardest.

We assess the climate risk exposure of property and casualty (P&C) and life insurance companies in the U.S. We construct a novel physical risk factor by forming a portfolio of P&C insurers’ stocks, with each insurer’s weight reflecting their operational exposure to states associated with high physical climate risk. We then estimate the dynamic physical climate beta, representing the stock return sensitivity of each insurer to the physical risk factor. In addition, using the climate beta estimates introduced by Jung et al. (2021), we calculate the expected capital shortfall of insurers under various climate stress scenarios. We validate our approach by utilizing granular data on insurers’ asset holdings and state-level operational exposure. Our findings indicate a positive association between larger exposures to risky states and higher holdings of brown assets with higher sensitivity to physical and transition risk, respectively.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1066,1066,7/12/2023,FED-NEWYORK,7/12/2023

Our approach combines worker-level data with time-series smoothing methods and can disentangle the common persistence of wage inflation from the persistence specific to some subgroup of workers, such as workers in a specific industry. We find that most of the business cycle fluctuations in wage inflation are persistent and driven by a common factor. This common persistent factor is particularly important during inflationary periods, and it explains 80 to 90 percent of the post-pandemic surge in wage inflation. Contrary to standard measures of wage inflation, the persistent component of wage inflation contemporaneously co-moves with labor market tightness.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1067,1067,7/13/2023,FED-NEWYORK,7/13/2023

While deep electrification is promising for road vehicles in wealthy countries, it will face steep obstacles. In other sectors and in the developing world, it’s not even in pole position. Global transportation decarbonization will require decoupling emissions from economic growth, and decoupling emissions from growth will require not only new technologies, but cooperation in governance.

How to Construct Monthly VAR Proxies Based on Daily Futures Market Surprises,Lutz Kilian,"It is common in applied work to estimate responses of macroeconomic aggregates to news shocks derived from surprise changes in daily futures prices around the date of policy announcements. This requires mapping the daily surprises into a monthly shock that may be used as an external instrument in a monthly VAR model or local projection. The standard approach has been to sum these daily surprises over the course of a given month when constructing the monthly proxy variable, ignoring the accounting relationship between daily and average monthly price data. In this paper, I provide a new approach to constructing monthly proxies from daily surprises that takes account of this link and revisit the question of how to use OPEC announcements to identify news shocks in VAR models of the global oil market. The proposed approach calls into question the interpretation of the identified shock as oil supply news and implies quantitatively and qualitatively different estimates of the macroeconomic impact of OPEC announcements.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2023/wp2310.pdf,2310,23-Jul-23,FED-DALLAS,7/23/2023
The Tail That Wagged the Dog: What Explains the Persistent Employment Effect of the 10-Day PPP Funding Delay?,"Olga Gorbachev, María J. Luengo-Prado, and J. Christina Wang","This study explores the mechanisms explaining the large, persistent effect of the 10-day funding delay in the 2020 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) on employment recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic, as estimated by Doniger and Kay (2021). We find that the top 1 percent of urban counties by population fully account for the significant effect of the delay on county-level employment. The strong correlation between worse loan delay and slower employment growth in these counties is due to a factor commonly omitted from analyses: The nature of business and the high rate of human interactions in major urban centers render these areas exceptionally and persistently vulnerable to infectious diseases. Moreover, we find that receiving more PPP funding and more transfers from other pandemic-related assistance programs contributed significantly more to local economic recovery compared with receiving PPP funds earlier.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/the-tail-that-wagged-the-dog-explains-persistent-employment-effect-of-10-day-ppp-funding-delay,23-6,26-Jul-23,FED-BOSTON,7/26/2023
Sustainable Consumption and the Comprehensive Economic Well-Being of American Households,"Daniel H. Cooper, Barry Z. Cynamon, and Steven M. Fazzari","This paper develops a comprehensive measure of household economic well-being. The “sustainable consumption” concept accounts for income, assets, debt, transfer payments, and asset returns to estimate a consumption path that balances resources with expenditure over a household’s lifetime. Calculating sustainable consumption using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data demonstrates that it acts as an anchor for actual household spending. Results show that following a period of rapid growth from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s, sustainable consumption stagnated on average. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the decline in sustainable consumption exceeded the fall in actual consumption due in part to a decline in real asset returns. Decomposing sustainable consumption reveals the relative importance of different household resources in determining well-being and how these factors evolve over time—insights that would be missed when resources such as income or wealth are considered separately. Taxable income supports the majority of sustainable consumption; however, as a share of households’ lifetime resources, taxable income has decreased on average while the Social Security share has grown.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/sustainable-consumption-and-the-comprehensive-economic-well-being-of-american-households,23-5,27-Jul-23,FED-BOSTON,7/27/2023
Beta-Sorted Portfolios,"Matias D. Cattaneo, Richard K. Crump, and Weining Wang","Beta-sorted portfolios—portfolios comprised of assets with similar covariation to selected risk factors—are a popular tool in empirical finance to analyze models of (conditional) expected returns. Despite their widespread use, little is known of their statistical properties in contrast to comparable procedures such as two-pass regressions. We formally investigate the properties of beta-sorted portfolio returns by casting the procedure as a two-step nonparametric estimator with a nonparametric first step and a beta-adaptive portfolios construction. Our framework rationalizes the well-known estimation algorithm with precise economic and statistical assumptions on the general data generating process. We provide conditions that ensure consistency and asymptotic normality along with new uniform inference procedures allowing for uncertainty quantification and general hypothesis testing for financial applications. We show that the rate of convergence of the estimator is non-uniform and depends on the beta value of interest. We also show that the widely used Fama-MacBeth variance estimator is asymptotically valid but is conservative in general and can be very conservative in empirically relevant settings. We propose a new variance estimator, which is always consistent and provide an empirical implementation which produces valid inference. In our empirical application we introduce a novel risk factor—a measure of the business credit cycle—and show that it is strongly predictive of both the cross-section and time-series behavior of U.S. stock returns.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1068,1068,7/27/2023,FED-NEWYORK,7/27/2023
Threshold Endogeneity in Threshold VARs: An Application to Monetary State Dependence,"Dimitris Christopoulos, Peter McAdam and Elias Tzavalis","We contribute a new method for dealing with the problem of endogeneity of the threshold variable in threshold vector auto-regression (TVAR) models. Drawing on copula theory enables us to capture the dependence structure between the threshold variable and the vector of TVAR innovations, independently of the marginal distribution of the threshold variable. A Monte Carlo demonstrates that our method works well, and that ignoring threshold endogeneity leads to biased estimates of the threshold parameter and the variance-covariance error structure, thus invalidating dynamic analysis. As an application, we assess the effects of interest rate shocks on output and inflation: when “expected” inflation exceeds 3.6 percent, the effects of monetary policy are faster and stronger than otherwise.",https://doi.org/10.18651/RWP2023-09,2023-09,7/28/2023,FED-KANSASCITY,7/28/2023

From Population Growth to TFP Growth,Hiroshi Inokuma and Juan M. Sánchez,"A slowdown in population growth causes a decline in business dynamism by increasing the share of old businesses. But how does it affect productivity growth? We answer this question by extending a standard firm dynamics model to include endogenous productivity growth. Theoretically, the growth rate of the size of surviving old businesses is a “sufficient statistic"" for determining the direction and magnitude of the impact of population growth on TFP growth. Quantitatively, this effect is significant across balanced growth paths for the United States and Japan. TFP growth in the United States falls by 0.10-0.23 percentage points because of the slowing in population growth between 1900 and 2060. The same driving force produces a noticeably bigger response in Japan. Despite the significant long-run effect, we discover that changes in TFP growth are slow in reaction to population growth changes due to two short-run counterbalancing factors.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-006,2023-006C,23-Aug,FED-STLOUIS,8/1/2023
How Much Should We Trust Regional-Exposure Designs?,Jeremy Majerovitz and Karthik Sastry,"Many prominent studies in macroeconomics, labor, and trade use panel data on regions to identify the local effects of aggregate shocks. These studies construct regional-exposure instruments as an observed aggregate shock times an observed regional exposure to that shock. We argue that the most economically plausible source of identification in these settings is uncorrelatedness of observed and unobserved aggregate shocks. Even when the regression estimator is consistent, we show that inference is complicated by cross-regional residual correlations induced by unobserved aggregate shocks. We suggest two-way clustering, two-way heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent standard errors, and randomization inference as options to solve this inference problem. We also develop a feasible optimal instrument to improve efficiency. In an application to the estimation of regional fiscal multipliers, we show that the standard practice of clustering by region generates confidence intervals that are too small. When we construct confidence intervals with robust methods, we can no longer reject multipliers close to zero at the 95% level. The feasible optimal instrument more than doubles statistical power; however, we still cannot reject low multipliers. Our results underscore that the precision promised by regional data may disappear with correct inference.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-018,2023-018A,23-Aug,FED-STLOUIS,8/1/2023
Trade Liberalization versus Protectionism: Dynamic Welfare Asymmetries,"B. Ravikumar, Ana Maria Santacreu, and Michael J. Sposi","We investigate whether the losses from an increase in trade costs (protectionism) are equal to the gains from a symmetric decrease in trade costs (liberalization). We incorporate dynamics through capital accumulation into a standard Armington trade model and show that the welfare changes are asymmetric: Losses from protectionism are smaller than the gains from liberalization. In contrast, standard static trade models imply that the losses equal the gains. The intuition for asymmetry in our model is that, following protectionism, the economy can coast off of previously accumulated capital stock, so higher trade costs do not imply large losses immediately. We develop an accounting device to decompose the source of welfare asymmetries into three time-varying contributions: share of income allocated to consumption, measured productivity, and capital stock. Asymmetry in capital accumulation is the largest contributing factor, and measured productivity is the smallest.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-019,2023-019B,23-Aug,FED-STLOUIS,8/1/2023

Minimum Wages and Labor Markets in the Twin Cities,"Loukas Karabarbounis, Jeremy Lise, Anusha Nath","We present new evidence on the labor market effects of large minimum wage increases by examining the policy changes implemented by Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Beginning with synthetic difference-in-differences methods, we find that the increase in the minimum wage decreased substantially restaurant and retail employment, even after accounting for potential confounding effects from the pandemic and civil unrest. Next, using variation in exposure to the minimum wage across establishments and workers within zip codes and industries of the Twin Cities, we find employment effects that are about half as large as those from the time series. The cross-sectional estimates difference out contemporaneous city-industry effects across establishments and workers, but they do not include equilibrium effects induced by the minimum wage such as changes in entry. We quantify a model of establishment dynamics to reconcile the different estimates and argue that they plausibly reflect lower and upper bounds of employment losses. We use the model to show that our estimates are consistent with an establishment elasticity of labor demand of -1 and illustrate how they can inform deeper parameters characterizing product and labor market competition, factor substitution, and establishment dynamics.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/working-papers/minimum-wages-and-labor-markets-in-the-twin-cities,793,2-Aug-23,FED-MINNEAPOLIS,8/2/2023

Risk Management and Derivatives Losses,"Gabriel  Levin-Konigsberg, Hillary Stein, Vicente  García Averell, and Calixto  López Castañon","Even though financial risk management has the ability to generate value, the use of financial derivatives among nonfinancial corporations remains limited. We identify a channel that contributes to this limited use: the decoupling of derivatives losses and operational gains. Specifically, firms ex post consider their operational profits separately from their derivatives profits. We explore this phenomenon among firms in Mexico. We use the universe of US dollar-Mexican peso currency derivatives transactions in Mexico along with customs data to construct a unique data set on operational exchange rate exposure and financial hedging. We find that contrary to a rational and frictionless benchmark, performance in previous derivatives transactions predicts future derivatives use. Using a regression kink design to measure the impact of decoupling on risk management, we find that when losses from previous transactions increase 1 percentage point, firms become 4.24 percentage points less likely to take out a new derivatives position within 90 days. We provide further evidence that is consistent with decoupling and supports rejecting a net worth channel.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/risk-management-and-derivatives-losses,23-8,7-Aug-23,FED-BOSTON,8/7/2023

We present a model where there is heterogeneity across investors within countries, but there are no asymmetries across countries.

Oil Price Shocks and Inflation,Lutz Kilian and Xiaoqing Zhou,"Despite growing interest in the impact of oil and other energy price shocks on inflation and inflation expectations, until recently this question has not received much attention. This survey not only presents empirical results for the U.S. economy, but expands the analysis to include other major economies. We find that only in the euro area and in the U.K. energy price shocks are associated with a material increase in core consumer prices. This helps explain the somewhat more persistent response of headline inflation in these countries than in the U.S. or Canada. Inflation is even less sensitive to energy price shocks in Japan. We document that energy price shocks played a more important role in explaining headline inflation in the euro area in 2021 and 2022 than in the U.S. This does not mean that energy price shocks have de-anchored inflation expectations, however. While suitable data on long-run inflation expectations are scant, neither for the U.S. nor the U.K. is there evidence that energy price shocks have materially changed long-run inflation expectations.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2023/wp2312.pdf,2312,20-Aug-23,FED-DALLAS,8/20/2023

Marriage and Work Among Prime-Age Men,"Adam Blandin, John Bailey Jones and Fang Yang","Married men work substantially more hours than men who have never been married, even after controlling for observables. Panel data reveal that much of this gap is attributable to an increase in work in the years leading up to marriage. Two potential explanations for this increase are: (i) men hit by positive labor market shocks are more likely to marry; and (ii) the prospect of marriage increases men’s labor supply. We quantify the relative importance of these two channels using a structural life-cycle model of marriage and labor supply. Our calibration implies that marriage substantially increases male labor supply. Counterfactual simulations suggest that if men were unable to marry, prime-age male work hours would fall by 7%, and if marriage rates fell to the extent observed, men born around 1980 would work 2% fewer hours than men born around 1960.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2023/wp2313.pdf,2313,23-Aug-23,FED-DALLAS,8/23/2023

Cost-Price Relationships in a Concentrated Economy,"Falk Bräuning, José L.

On average, we find, prices increase above trend growth for three quarters after an exogenous cost shock, and the price increase is accompanied by a decline in output. The estimated pass-through of the shock into prices one quarter ahead is 0.7. The price response to shocks becomes about 27 percent larger when there is an increase in concentration similar to the one observed over the last 20 years. This differential effect depending on concentration is primarily driven by a larger pass-through of positive shocks that increase costs. Consistent with a market power channel, margins decrease less in more concentrated industries after cost increases. Within industries, margins of industry leaders are not squeezed in response to positive cost shocks, unlike those of followers, while negative shocks increase margins for all firms. Our findings shed light on the post-COVID inflationary pressures and the linkages between inflation dynamics and rising market concentration.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/cost-price-relationships-in-a-concentrated-economy,23-9,31-Aug-23,FED-BOSTON,8/31/2023

Using Monte Carlos with different misspecifications, we determine under what conditions either method is preferred. We then extend model-average impulse responses to this nonlinear environment and show that they generally perform better than either generalized impulse response functions and local projections.

Preventive vs. Curative Medicine: A Macroeconomic Analysis of Health Care over the Life Cycle,Serdar Ozkan,"This paper studies differences in health care usage and health outcomes between low- and high-income individuals. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) I find that early in life the rich spend significantly more on health care, whereas from middle to very old age medical spending of the poor surpasses that of the rich by 25%. In addition, low-income individuals are less likely to incur any medical expenditures in a given year, yet, when they do, their expenses are more likely to be extreme. To account for these facts, I develop and estimate a life-cycle model of two types of health capital: physical and preventive. Physical health capital determines survival probabilities, whereas preventive health capital governs the endogenous distribution of shocks to physical health capital, thereby controlling the life expectancy. Moreover, I incorporate important features of the U.S. health care system such as private health insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare. In the model, from the very early ages the rich spend more in preventive health to expand their life expectancy, which leads to milder health shocks (and lower curative medical expenditures) for them in old age compared to the poor. Public insurance—which is designed to insure large expenditures—amplifies these differences by hampering the incentives of the poor to invest in preventive health. I use the model to examine a counterfactual economy with universal health insurance in which 75% of preventive medical spending is reimbursed. My results suggest that policies encouraging the use of health care by the poor early in life produce significant welfare gains, even when fully accounting for the increase in taxes required to pay for them.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-025,2023-025B,23-Sep,FED-STLOUIS,9/1/2023
"Living Up to Expectations: Central Bank Credibility, the Effectiveness of Forward Guidance and Inflation Dynamics Post-Global Financial Crisis","Stephen J. Cole, Enrique Martínez García and Eric Sims","This paper studies the effectiveness of forward guidance when central banks have imperfect credibility. Exploiting unique survey-based measures of expected inflation, output growth and interest rates, we estimate a small-scale New Keynesian model for the United States and other G7 countries plus Spain allowing for deviations from full information rational expectations. In our model, the key parameter that aggregates heterogeneous expectations captures the central bank's credibility and affects the overall effectiveness of forward guidance. We find that the central banks of the U.S., the U.K., Germany and other major advanced economies have similar levels of credibility (albeit far from full credibility); however, Japan's central bank credibility is much lower. For each country, our measure of credibility has declined over time, making forward guidance less effective. In a counterfactual analysis, we document that inflation would have been significantly higher, and the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates much less of an issue, in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis had the public perceived central bank forward guidance statements to be perfectly credible. Moreover, inflation would have declined more, and somewhat faster, with perfect credibility in the wake of the inflation surge post-COVID-19.",https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/international/wpapers/2023/0424.pdf,GI424,23-Sep,FED-DALLAS,9/1/2023
Capital Management and Wealth Inequality,James Best and Keshav Dogra,"Wealthier individuals have stronger incentives to seek higher returns. We investigate theoretically the effect this has on long-run wealth inequality. Incorporating capital management into a standard Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model generates substantial long-run inequality: the majority of the population works and holds no capital, while a small minority holds a large amount of capital and manages it full-time. Counterintuitively, financial innovations or policies that reduce return differentials increase long-run wealth inequality. Egalitarian steady states may exist, but are inefficient and unstable: a small concentration in capital ownership causes a transition to an unequal steady state. Capital management introduces a novel equity-efficiency tradeoff: scale economies make it efficient for a few individuals to manage capital full-time, but under laissez-faire this generates substantial inequality. A utilitarian planner would instead instruct a few individuals to manage capital on behalf of society and transfer most of their income to the workers.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1072,1072,9/1/2023,FED-NEWYORK,9/1/2023

Charting the Course: How Does Information about Sea Level Rise Affect the Willingness to Migrate?,"Laura Bakkensen, Quynh Nguyen, Toan Phan and Paul Schuler","An important yet less studied factor in determining the extent of adaptation to climate change is information: are people adequately informed about their vulnerability to future climate-related risks, and does their willingness to adapt depend on this knowledge? Focusing on how communication about projected sea level rise (SLR) affects the willingness to migrate, we implemented a large randomized control survey experiment with a nationally representative sample of more than 7,000 respondents across all provinces in Vietnam. We randomly assign respondents to different information treatments. We find that providing a simple text-based information treatment about the general extent of Vietnam's exposure to projected SLR increases all respondents' willingness to migrate (including respondents living in areas not vulnerable to SLR). However, a more spatially precise map information treatment—providing the general text along with a map showing Vietnam's projected SLR exposure—leads to a more targeted effect: it only significantly increases the willingness to migrate of respondents currently residing in vulnerable areas. Finally, adding doubt to the information treatments—mentioning an official repudiation of the scientific projection of SLR—does not reduce the treatments' impact. Our findings are inconsistent with the commonly used perfect information benchmark, which assumes that people are fully informed about future climate-related risks. They also highlight the importance of providing spatially precise information in facilitating climate adaptation.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-09,23-09,18-Sep-23,FED-RICHMOND,9/18/2023

In this paper, we investigate similarities and differences between the two, comparing investor behavior during the stablecoin runs of 2022 and 2023 to investor behavior during the money market fund runs of 2008 and 2020. We document that, similarly to money market fund investors, stablecoin investors engage in flight to safety, with net flows from riskier to safer stablecoins during run periods.

Lease Expirations and CRE Property Performance,David Glancy and J. Christina Wang,"This study analyzes how lease expirations affect the performance of commercial real estate (CRE) properties and how these patterns changed during the COVID-19 crisis. Even before the pandemic, lease expirations were associated with a notable increase in the downside risk to a property’s occupancy or income, particularly in weaker property markets. These risks became more pronounced during the pandemic, driven mostly by office properties. During the pandemic, the adverse effect of lease expirations on office occupancy increased more than 50 percent overall, and it doubled for offices in central business districts (CBDs). This amplified effect of office lease expirations serves as a harbinger of further deterioration as leases continue to roll over in coming years, especially among CBD offices. Across lender groups, nonbank and large bank lenders are more exposed than regional and community banks to office loans in those distressed CBDs. This pattern somewhat alleviates the concern that CRE portfolio credit risk will exacerbate the headwinds faced by this latter group of banks.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/lease-expirations-and-cre-property-performance,23-10,21-Sep-23,FED-BOSTON,9/21/2023
Investing in the Batteries and Vehicles of the Future: A View Through the Stock Market,Michael Plante,"A large number of companies operating in the EV and battery supply chain have listed on a major U.S. stock exchange in recent years. This paper investigates 1) how these companies’ stock returns are related to systematic risk factors that can explain movements in the stock market and 2) how these companies’ idiosyncratic returns are related to one another. To do so, I compile a unique data set of intradaily stock returns that spans the supply chain, including companies focused on the mining of battery and EV-related critical minerals, advanced battery technology, lithium-ion battery production, EV original equipment manufacturers (EV OEMs) and EV charging companies. The returns are decomposed into a systematic and idiosyncratic component, with the systematic component given by latent factors extracted from a large panel of stock returns using high-frequency principal components. A key feature of the returns of interest is that they can be explained not only by a market factor but also by a second factor that loads on tech and consumer discretionary stocks. There is evidence for cross-sectional dependence in the idiosyncratic returns but correlations are generally low, except for some specific groups, e.g., lithium mining companies. The first principal component of the idiosyncratic returns, which can be viewed as an “EV” factor, explains only about 13 percent of their variation.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2023/wp2314.pdf,2314,22-Sep-23,FED-DALLAS,9/22/2023

Economic Benefits and Social Costs of Legalizing Recreational Marijuana,"Jason P.

We find moderate economic gains accompanied by some social costs. Post-legalization, average state income grew by 3 percent, house prices by 6 percent, and population by 2 percent. However, substance use disorders, chronic homelessness, and arrests increased by 17, 35, and 13 percent, respectively. Although some of our estimates are noisy, our findings suggest that the economic benefits of legalization are broadly distributed, while the social costs may be more concentrated among individuals who use marijuana heavily.

We find there is little empirical evidence to support learning as a primary mechanism of detailing visits and, in fact, document strong evidence to the contrary.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2023/2023-40,2023-40,23-Oct,FED-CHICAGO,10/1/2023
Uncovering the Differences among Displaced Workers: Evidence from Canadian Job Separation Records,"Serdar Birinci, Youngmin Park, Thomas Pugh, and Kurt See","We revisit the measurement of the sources and consequences of job displacement using Canadian job separation records. To circumvent administrative data limitations, conventional approaches address selection by identifying displacement effects through mass-layoff separations, which are interpreted as involuntary. We refine this procedure and find that only a quarter of mass-layoff separations are indeed layoffs. Isolating mass-layoff separations that reflect involuntary displacement, we find twice the earnings losses relative to existing estimates. We uncover heterogeneity in losses for separations with different reason and timing, ranging from 15 percent for quits after a mass layoff to 60 percent for layoffs before it.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-022,2023-022B,23-Oct,FED-STLOUIS,10/1/2023
On the Transition to Modern Growth,B. Ravikumar and Guillaume Vandenbroucke,"We study a simple model where a single good can be produced using a diminishing-returns technology (Malthus) and a constant-returns technology (Solow). The economy's output exhibits three stages: (i) stagnation, (ii) transition with increasing growth, and (iii) constant growth in the long run. We map the Malthus technology to agriculture and show that the share of agricultural employment is sufficient to determine the onset of economic transition. Using data on the share, we estimate the onset of transition for the U.S. and Western Europe without using output data. Our model implies that output growth during the transition is a first-order autoregressive process and that the rate of decline in the share of agricultural employment is a sufficient statistic to describe the output growth. Quantitatively, while there is no a priori reason why agricultural employment would pin down output dynamics over two centuries, the autoregressive coefficient on the output growth process is practically the same as the one implied by the rate of decline in the share of agricultural employment.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-026,2023-026B,23-Oct,FED-STLOUIS,10/1/2023

"Measuring Digital Intermediation Services: Experimental Estimates of Gross Output for Rideshare, Travel Services, and Food/Grocery Delivery Service Platforms","Tina Highfill, Brian Quistorff","The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) produces economic statistics through its system of satellite accounts that highlight specialized areas of the economy that are not directly apparent in BEA’s official economic statistics published under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), such as outdoor recreation and arts and culture. BEA recently developed a Digital Economy Satellite Account (DESA) to better understand this area of the economy as it involves production that spans multiple NAICS industries, ranging from computer manufacturing to internet-based retail trade (e-commerce) to software production. Currently, BEA’s digital economy statistics do not fully capture production of digital intermediary services earned from operating a digital platform that facilitates the direct interaction between multiple buyers and multiple sellers for a fee (such as rideshare), resulting in an incomplete picture of the digital economy. In this paper, we discuss options for measuring digital intermediary services across selected industries of interest to other international statistical agencies as well as BEA: rideshare, travel services, and food/grocery delivery services. We also provide experimental estimates of gross output for these services that cover 2018–2021 using two approaches. We find that digital intermediation services for rideshare, travel services, and food/grocery delivery services represented at least $31 billion in 2021 gross output, or close to 1 percent of the overall value of the digital economy based on the latest DESA statistics.",https://www.bea.gov//research/papers/2023/measuring-digital-intermediation-services-experimental-estimates-gross-output,WP2023-8,10/10/2023,BEA,10/10/2023

While this approach is well suited for many purposes, it can lead to difficulty in interpreting direct investment statistics, especially in identifying the economies that are the ultimate destinations, or hosts, of direct investment. BEA’s initial effort to produce U.S. direct investment abroad statistics by ultimate host economy (UHE), described in this paper, focused on producing statistics on equity position by UHE using six different methods to reallocate the equity position by immediate host economy. The methods are implemented using direct investment data reported on BEA’s Quarterly Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad and activities of multinational enterprises data reported on BEA’s Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad.

In addition to a standard array of shocks, the model includes time variation in agents’ preference for safe bonds. We allow for a component of this time variation to be common across countries and biased toward dollar-denominated safe assets, and refer to this component as global flight to safety (GFS). We find that GFS shocks are the most important shocks driving world business cycles, and are also important drivers of activity in the U.S. and especially abroad. An adverse GFS shock lowers global GDP and inflation, widens global corporate credit spreads, and appreciates the dollar. These effects are very close to those obtained from a structural VAR which uses the excess bond premium (Gilchrist and Zakraj¡sek, 2012) as proxy for global flight to safety.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/working-papers/global-flight-to-safety-business-cycles-and-the-dollar,799,11-Oct-23,FED-MINNEAPOLIS,10/11/2023

An Experimental Analysis of Quality Misperception in Food Labels,Francisco Scott,"The size and distribution of surplus in markets where credence quality attributes of food (e.g., organic, non-GMO) are conveyed through some informational mechanism (typically labels) crucially depend on 1) how information changes consumers’ perception of quality and 2) producers’ strategic choice of quality provision in response to changes in consumers’ perception of quality. This paper examines the hypothesis that consumers’ misperception of quality information can provide incentives to sellers to increase quality and offset the lower quality that exists in markets where firms imperfectly compete in quality and prices. Using previously derived theoretical predictions of a two-stage game in which firms sequentially choose qualities—which are misperceived by consumers—to then simultaneously choose prices, I conduct a laboratory experiment that emulates changes in consumers’ perception of quality and examines their effects on producers’ provision of quality and market surplus. My results indicate that total surplus increases mainly with overvaluation of the high-quality product, confirming theoretical predictions. But contrary to the theory, I find that low-quality sellers try to compete by raising their quality levels too much when low quality is overvalued, dampening their quality-adjusted prices. As a result, welfare approaches first-best only when the high-quality product produced by the market leader is overvalued. These results highlight the importance of examining the market structure when designing informational policies.",https://doi.org/10.18651/RWP2023-11,2023-11,10/19/2023,FED-KANSASCITY,10/19/2023

Asymmetries in the international production network play a key role in the model’s ability to produce large domestic effects of foreign sectoral supply shocks and large differential effects of domestic shocks and global shocks. Larger trade openness and substitutability between domestic inputs and foreign inputs can also significantly amplify the effects of foreign and global sectoral shocks on domestic aggregates. In comparison, sectoral heterogeneity in price stickiness does not materially amplify the domestic responses to productivity shocks that originate abroad.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/the-aggregate-effects-of-sectoral-shocks-in-an-open-economy.aspx,23-13,20-Oct-23,FED-BOSTON,10/20/2023

In this paper, we empirically investigate whether corruption increases the loss of human lives caused by natural disasters, using a large panel of 135 countries during the period 1980–2020. The econometric analysis provides convincing evidence that corruption increases the number of disaster-related deaths, after controlling for economic, demographic, healthcare and institutional factors. That is, the higher the level of corruption in a given country, the greater the number of fatalities as a share of population due to natural disasters.

Using Macro Counterfactuals to Assess Plausibility: An Illustration using the 2001 Rebate MPCs,"Jacob Orchard, Valerie A. Ramey, Johannes Wieland","Macroeconomics has increasingly adopted tools from the applied micro “credibility revolution” to estimate micro parameters that can inform macro questions. In this paper, we argue that researchers should take advantage of this confluence of micro and macro to take the credibility revolution one step further. We argue that researchers should assess the plausibility of the micro estimates and macro models by constructing macro counterfactuals for historical periods and comparing these counterfactuals with reasonable benchmarks. We illustrate this approach by conducting a case study of the 2001 U.S. tax rebates, as well as briefly summarizing two previous applications of the methodology. In the 2001 rebate case, we calibrate a two-good, two-agent New Keynesian model with the leading estimates of the household marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of the rebates to construct a counterfactual path for nondurable consumption. The counterfactual path implies that without the tax rebate nondurable consumption spending would have fallen dramatically in the late summer and fall of 2001. Using forecasting regressions and other evidence, we argue that this counterfactual is implausible. When we investigate the source of the discrepancy, we find that the leading MPC estimates are not representative of the response of total consumption.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31808,31808,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023

Heterogeneous Agent Trade,Michael E. Waugh,"This paper studies the implications of household heterogeneity for trade. I develop a model where household heterogeneity is induced via incomplete markets and results in heterogeneous price elasticities. Conditional on exposure to trade, heterogeneous price elasticities imply that different households value price changes differently, and thus rich and poor households experience different gains from trade. I calibrate the model to match bilateral trade flows and micro-facts about household-level expenditure patterns and elasticities. I find gains from trade that are pro-poor and that the average gains from trade are substantially larger than representative agent benchmarks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31810,31810,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Wars and the Labor Market Outcomes of Minorities in the U.S.,Andreas Ferrara,"This chapter reviews key literature studying the effects of wars on minority and underrepresented groups in U.S. labor markets in the 20th century. These labor markets, characterized by historically pervasive barriers to entry into certain occupations and industries, promotions, and fair pay for underrepresented workers, experienced severe challenges during times of war. These challenges served to break down some of the barriers faced by underrepresented workers. Recent years have shown that sudden labor shortages, similar to those induced by large-scale wars, are not a feature of the past. Hence, a better understanding of such shortages and their effects on different groups continues to be important. The focus here is on the labor market outcomes of Black and white women, as well as Black men, during and after the two World Wars. Their labor inputs compensated for the lack of white male workers during the war years; however, only WWII generated significant and more prolonged socioeconomic progress for both groups. This chapter summarizes theoretical considerations that can explain why some war-induced labor market shocks are persistent while others are not, and the empirical literature related to the labor market experiences of women and Black workers during and after the World Wars.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31811,31811,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023

Inclusive GovTech: Enhancing Efficiency and Equity Through Public Service Digitalization,Manabu Nose,"How could the GovTech improve budget processes and execution efficiency? Could the GovTech strengthen redistributive function of public expenditure? Based on an event-study method, this paper finds that the introduction of digital budget payments and e-procurement could significantly enhance budget transparency and help expand the coverage of social assistance to reach the most vulnerable population. Exploiting staggered adoption of digital budget payments, a synthetic control regression identifies meaningful increase in pre-tax income shares among the bottom 50th percentile and female workers, especially for emerging market and developing countries, with effects materializing gradually over 10-year period. The paper delves into the potential mechanism driving these equity benefits, highlighting the reduction in business informality as a primary channel. However, the paper emphasizes that the mere adoption of GovTech strategies or digital technologies is insufficient to unlock its full potential. The outcomes are intricately linked to supporting policies, regulations, organizational and system integration, and robust digital connectivity. The paper underscores that inter-agency coordination facilitated by a dedicated GovTech institution emerges as a critical factor for reaping both efficiency and equity gains from GovTech initiatives.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Inclusive-GovTech-Enhancing-Efficiency-and-Equity-Through-Public-Service-Digitalization-540984,WPIEA2023226,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Long Live Globalization: Geopolitical Shocks and International Trade,Serhan Cevik,"Are we really witnessing the death of globalization? A multitude of shocks over the past three years has unsettled the conventional wisdom on economic integration and fueled widespread calls for protectionist and nationalist policies. Using an extensive dataset with more than 4 million observations, I develop an augmented gravity model of bilateral trade flows among 59,049 country-pairs over the period 1948–2021 and find that the much-debated geopolitical alignment between countries has contradictory and statistically insignificant effects on trade, depending on the level of economic development. Moreover, the economic magnitude of this effect is not as important as income or geographic distance and it diminishes significantly when extreme outliers are removed from the sample. The empirical analysis presented in this paper also confirms that the level of income in both origin and destination countries has a positive impact on trade, while the greater the distance between countries, the smaller the flow of bilateral trade due to higher trade costs. Cultural similarities and historical ties are also important in shaping trade flows, just like trade agreements that tend to lead to higher level of international trade.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Long-Live-Globalization-Geopolitical-Shocks-and-International-Trade-540832,WPIEA2023225,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Micro-Assessment of Macroprudential Borrower-Based Measures in Lithuania,"Mantas Dirma, Jaunius Karmelavičius","Despite having introduced borrower-based measures (BBM), Lithuania's housing and mortgage markets were booming during the low-interest-rate period, casting doubt on the macroprudential toolkit's ability to contain excessive mortgage growth. This paper assesses the adequacy of BBMs’ parametrization in Lithuania. We do so by building a novel lifetime expected credit loss framework that is founded on actual loan-level default and household income data. We show that the BBM package effectively contains mortgage credit risk and that housing loans are more resilient to stress than in the preregulatory era. Our BBM limit calibration exercise reveals that (1) in the low-rate environment, income-based measures could have been tighter; and (2) borrowers taking out secondary mortgages rightly are and should be required to pledge a higher down payment.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Micro-Assessment-of-Macroprudential-Borrower-Based-Measures-in-Lithuania-540987,WPIEA2023227,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Analyzing Bounded Count Data,John Mullahy,"This paper presents and assesses analytical strategies that respect the bounded count structures of outcomes that are encountered often in health and other applications. The paper's main motivation is that the applied econometrics literature lacks a comprehensive discussion and critique of strategies for analyzing and understand such data. The paper's goal is to provide a treatment of prominent issues arising in such analyses, with particular focus on evaluations in which bounded count outcomes are of interest, and on econometric modeling of their probability and moment structures. Hopefully the paper will provide a toolkit for researchers so they may better appreciate the range of questions that might be asked of such data and the merits and limitations of the analytical methods they might contemplate to study them. It will be seen that the choice of analytical method is often consequential: questions of interest may be unanswerable when some familiar analytical methods are deployed in some circumstances.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31814,31814,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Economic Growth under Transformative AI,"Philip Trammell, Anton Korinek","Industrialized countries have long seen relatively stable growth in output per capita and a stable labor share. AI may be transformative, in the sense that it may break one or both of these stylized facts. This review outlines the ways this may happen by placing several strands of the literature on AI and growth within a common framework. We first evaluate models in which AI increases output production, for example via increases in capital's substitutability for labor or task automation, capturing the notion that AI will let capital “self-replicate”. This typically speeds up growth and lowers the labor share. We then consider models in which AI increases knowledge production, capturing the notion that AI will let capital “self-improve”, speeding growth further. Taken as a whole, the literature suggests that sufficiently advanced AI is likely to deliver both effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31815,31815,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Public Support for Climate Change Mitigation Policies: A Cross Country Survey,"Era Dabla-Norris, Salma Khalid, Giacomo Magistretti, Alexandre Sollaci","Building public support for climate mitigation is a key prerequisite to making meaningful strides toward decarbonization and achieving net-zero emissions. Using nationally representative, individual-level surveys for 28 countries, this paper identifies the current levels and drivers of support for climate mitigation policies. Controlling for individual characteristics, we find that pre-existing beliefs about policy efficacy, perceived costs and co-benefits (e.g., cleaner air), and the degree of policy progressivity are important drivers of support for carbon pricing policies. The knowledge gap about climate mitigation policies can be large, but randomized information experiments show that support increases (decreases) after individuals are introduced to new information on the benefits (potential costs) of such policies.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Public-Support-for-Climate-Change-Mitigation-Policies-A-Cross-Country-Survey-540823,WPIEA2023223,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
How Does Medicaid Expansion Impact Income Support Program Participation and Employment for Different Types of People with Disabilities?,"Ari Ne&#039;eman, Nicole Maestas","Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income, the United States’ two primary disability income support programs, each offer a pathway to public health insurance in addition to cash benefits. This implies that expansions in public health insurance availability, such as the ACA’s Medicaid expansions, may impact disability program participation and employment of people with disabilities. However, prior research has yielded mixed results as to the impact of Medicaid expansion on these outcomes. Using a stacked difference-in-differences design and data from the Current Population Survey, we demonstrate that the ACA’s Medicaid expansions increased SSDI receipt among individuals ages 50-64 with physical, self-care and independent living disabilities, consistent with a “job unlock” mechanism. Exploiting the longitudinal nature of the CPS, we show that treatment effects are heterogeneous and concentrated among persons with ongoing disabilities (as opposed to new disabilities) as reported on the CPS’s 6-question functional impairment sequence. We also show suggestive evidence of a reduction in SSI, but find that it is sensitive to specification and data preparation choices, which we illustrate through comparison with other recent work. Effects on employment are inconclusive. Our findings provide further evidence of work capacity among SSDI beneficiaries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31816,31816,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Semiparametric Conditional Factor Models: Estimation and Inference,"Qihui Chen, Nikolai Roussanov, Xiaoliang Wang","This paper introduces a simple and tractable sieve estimation of semiparametric conditional factor models with latent factors. We establish large-N-asymptotic properties of the estimators without requiring large T. We also develop a simple bootstrap procedure for conducting inference about the conditional pricing errors as well as the shapes of the factor loading functions. These results enable us to estimate conditional factor structure of a large set of individual assets by utilizing arbitrary nonlinear functions of a number of characteristics without the need to pre-specify the factors, while allowing us to disentangle the characteristics' role in capturing factor betas from alphas (i.e., undiversifiable risk from mispricing). We apply these methods to the cross-section of individual U.S. stock returns and find strong evidence of large nonzero pricing errors that combine to produce arbitrage portfolios with Sharpe ratios above 3. We also document a significant decline in apparent mispricing over time.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31817,31817,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Does Wage Theft Vary by Demographic Group? Evidence from Minimum Wage Increases,"Jeffrey Clemens, Michael R. Strain","Using Current Population Survey data, we assess whether and to what extent the burden of wage theft — wage payments below the statutory minimum wage — falls disproportionately on various demographic groups following minimum wage increases. For most racial and ethnic groups at most ages we find that underpayment rises similarly as a fraction of realized wage gains in the wake of minimum wage increases. We also present evidence that the burden of underpayment falls disproportionately on relatively young African American workers and that underpayment increases more for Hispanic workers among the full working-age population.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31818,31818,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
"Social Unrests and Fuel Prices: The Role of Macroeconomic, Social and Institutional Factors","Alassane Drabo, Kodjovi M. Eklou, Patrick A. Imam, Kangni R Kpodar","This paper investigates the impact of fuel price increases on social unrests in addition to the macroeconomic, social and institutional factors driving this relationship. Using the IV fixed-effect estimator on a sample of 101 developing countries during 2001-2020, we find that changes in fuel prices are positively associated with the number of social unrests, mainly anti-government demonstrations. This impact is however amplified: (i) during economic downturns and periods of high exchange rate instability; (ii) when government spending is low, especially on health and education, thus suggesting that streamlining fuel subsides and diverting parts of the reform savings to the health and education sectors is an appropriate policy that could appease social tensions; (iii) in countries with high income inequality, low institutional quality and high level of corruption. The results are robust to a battery of tests, including the use of an instrumental variable approach to address reverse causality concerns given that social unrests could also prompt a freeze in fuel prices. We also find consistent results using either changes in diesel or gasoline prices. Overall, the findings of the paper provide support to the grievance and deprivation theory in explaining the association between fuel price increases and social unrests, but fail to find evidence for the resource theory and the theory of political opportunities.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Social-Unrests-and-Fuel-Prices-The-Role-of-Macroeconomic-Social-and-Institutional-Factors-539677,WPIEA2023228,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Social Insurance and Migration: Evidence from a Nation-Wide Institutional Reform in China,"Fanghua Li, Chenyang Ji, Moshe Buchinsky","In this paper we examine the causal relationship between formal social insurance and individuals’ migration decisions. We exploit a quasi experimental design in rural China, under which county officials were assigned to a group of villages (i.e., treated villages) to serve as village supervisors (VSs) for the local leaders. We show that this led to reduced favoritism in welfare allocation by the local leaders, thereby increasing the efficacy in the formal social insurance in the treated villages. We use detailed geo-referenced administrative household-level data suited for a spatial regression discontinuity design (RDD) to obtain an average treatment effect (LATE) of the improved social insurance on migration. The apparent variation in the implementation of the reform across treated villages and heterogeneous impacts on different family clans make it possible to directly link changes in the efficacy of the insurance to migration choices. We find a large positive migration effect, of about 19%, for the young males and females. In turn, this led to a large boost in the average household’s income in just two years.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31819,31819,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Hidden Exposure: Measuring US Supply Chain Reliance,"Richard Baldwin, Rebecca Freeman, Angelos Theodorakopoulos","Supply chain problems, previously relegated to specialized journals, now appear in G7 Leaders’ Communiqués. Our paper looks at three core elements of the problems: measurement of the links that expose supply chains to disruptions, the nature of the shocks that cause the disruptions, and the criteria for policy to mitigate the impact of disruptions. Utilizing global input-output data, we show that US exposure to foreign suppliers, and particularly to China, is ‘hidden’ in the sense that it is much larger than what conventional trade data suggest. However, at the macro level, exposure remains relatively modest, given that over 80% of US industrial inputs are sourced domestically. We argue that many recent shocks to supply chains have been systemic rather than idiosyncratic. Moreover, systemic shocks are likely to arise from climate change, geoeconomic tensions, and digital disruptions. Our principal conclusion is that concerns regarding supply chain disruptions, and policies to address them, should focus on individual products, rather than the whole manufacturing sector.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31820,31820,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Value Added Tax in the Extractive Industries,"Artur Swistak, Nate Vernon","Lower capacity countries often struggle to administer the Value Added Tax (VAT) in the extractive industries, partly due to the large VAT refunds needs of this capital and export-intensive sector. Assuming that the first-best policy (apply the standard VAT to the extractive industry) is not possible in the medium-term, what should countries do? This paper systemically analyzes second-best VAT policy designs considering the impact of the VAT on three key stakeholders: the investor, domestic suppliers, and the tax administration. The analysis concludes that the generally preferred policy is to provide a VAT exemption for imports and either fully tax or exempt domestic supplies, although country characteristics (and, specifically the relative weighting of stakeholders) matter. Moreover, governments should make efforts to shorten refund delays and transition to a standard VAT over the longer-term.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Value-Added-Tax-in-the-Extractive-Industries-540826,WPIEA2023221,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Environmental Consequences of Hydrocarbon Infrastructure Policy,"Thomas Covert, Ryan Kellogg","We study policies that aim to “keep carbon in the ground” by blocking fossil fuel infrastructure investment.

We apply the model to the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which moves oil from North Dakota to Texas and was controversially completed in 2017. Had DAPL’s construction been enjoined, we estimate that 81% of the blocked pipeline flows would move by rail instead. This substitution induces both private costs and local environmental damage, since rail transport imposes greater local externalities than pipelines.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/environmental-consequences-of-hydrocarbon-infrastructure-policy/,2023-138,25-Oct-23,BFI,10/30/2023
Climate Shocks in the Anthropocene Era: Should Net Domestic Product Be Affected by Climate Disasters,"Leonard Nakamura, Brian Sliker","The monetary costs of weather and climate disasters in the U.S. have grown rapidly from 1980 to 2022, rising more than 5 percent in real terms annually. Much of this real growth in costs is likely due to climate change. Regardless of its cause, these costs imply a faster depreciation of real assets. We argue that the expected depreciation from these events could be included in the consumption of fixed capital, leading to lower levels, and slightly lower growth rates, for net domestic product (NDP). We use Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood regressions to estimate this expectation and to generate our experimental measure of costs. An alternative calculation of depreciation and NDP might be derived from the time series of costs incurred rather than from the far smoother expectation. This latter series might be more appropriate for a national income satellite account. We also investigate the parametric distributions of the annual average-cost and total-cost data.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/macroeconomics/climate-shocks-in-the-anthropocene-era-should-net-domestic-product-be-affected-by-climate-disasters,23-24,24-Oct-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,10/30/2023

However, it is much less known about the reasons for Statistical Agencies (SAs) to revise their estimates. In order to be timely and reliable, SAs have an explicit interest in not revising their initial GDP estimates too much, while they are much more open to revise GDP components over time.

To address the endogeneity of benefit recipients’ health status, we instrument for benefit receipt using the leniency of randomly assigned evaluators who assess the applicant’s functional status and determine benefit eligibility. We find that for compliers – applicants who receive subsidies only from more lenient evaluators – subsidizing home-based care has large adverse effects on recipient health but no detectable effects on the labor market outcomes of their children.

This paper contributes to that discussion by developing macroeconomic measures of marketing investments and stocks for the United States. We also construct and analyze measures of how marketing and other intangibles contribute to output growth in the 61 industries that comprise the U.S. private business sector.We find that marketing contributes approximately as much to output growth as software and R&D (research and development) do.

Software grows more rapidly, whereas marketing has a larger factor share. Marketing contributes even more to output if quality is adjusted to allow for better targeting associated with digital advertising.

In particular, CBDC could in principle put substantial upward pressure on the spread of the federal funds rate and other wholesale funding rates over the interest rate on reserves unless the Fed expanded its balance sheet to accommodate CBDC issuance.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-effects-of-cbdc-on-the-federal-reserves-balance-sheet.htm,2023-068,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/3/2023
Endogenous Labor Supply in an Estimated New-Keynesian Model: Nominal versus Real Rigidities,"Isabel Cairo, Hess Chung, Francesco Ferrante, Cristina Fuentes-Albero, Camilo Morales-Jimenez, Damjan Pfajfar","The deep deterioration in the labor market during the Great Recession, the subsequent slow recovery, and the missing disinflation are hard to reconcile for standard macroeconomic models. We develop and estimate a New-Keynesian model with financial frictions, search and matching frictions in the labor market, and endogenous intensive and extensive labor supply decisions. We conclude that the estimated combination of the low degree of nominal wage rigidities and high degree of real wage rigidities, together with the small role of pre-match costs relative to post-match costs, are key in successfully forecasting the slow recovery in unemployment and the missing disinflation in the aftermath of the Great Recession. We find that endogenous labor supply data are very informative about the relative degree of nominal and real wage rigidities and the slope of the Phillips curve. We also find that none of the model-based labor market gaps are a sufficient statistic of labor market slack, but all contain relevant information about the state of the economy summarized in a new indicator for labor market slack we put forward.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/endogenous-labor-supply-in-an-estimated-new-keynesian-model.htm,2023-069,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/3/2023
An Alternative Measure of Core Inflation:  The Trimmed Persistence PCE Price Index,John O'Trakoun,"I introduce the ""trimmed persistence PCE,"" a new measure of core inflation in which component prices are weighted according to the time-varying persistence of their price changes. The components of trimmed persistence personal consumption expenditures (PCE) display less tendency to mechanically pass-through the level of the prior period's inflation to the current period; thus, the impact of the current stance of monetary policy and real economic factors are more likely to be visible in recent trimmed persistence inflation compared to headline inflation. Trimmed persistence inflation performs comparably to existing popular measures of core inflation in terms of volatility and relationship with economic slack. Model selection procedures confirm trimmed persistence PCE contributes additional information to inflation forecasting models when stacked against other popular measures of core inflation. Applying the new index in a Taylor rule analysis suggests the Fed's aggressive path of federal funds rate hikes during the pandemic may have achieved appropriately restrictive levels by the fourth quarter of 2022, clearing the way for more measured policy adjustment thereafter as risks of policy overshooting became more salient.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-10,23-10,27-Oct-23,FED-RICHMOND,11/3/2023
Assessing the Extent of Trade Fragmentation,Justin R.

Help wanted: the drivers and implications of labour shortages,"Martin Groiss, David Sondermann","Labour shortages have become prevalent across advanced economies. Yet, little is known about which firms are more likely to face them and the impact they have on the labour market. We create a firm-level data set spanning 28 EU countries, 283 regions and 18 sectors, contributing to close this gap. We find that structural factors play the dominant role. Firms in regions with limited labour supply as well as innovative and fast-growing firms are particularly prone to face labour shortages. Moreover, shortages tend to aggravate at business cycle peaks. In a second stage, we empirically determine the impact of labour shortages on wages and hiring. Firms with higher shortages pay a wage growth premium to keep and attract workers, increasingly so if they face excess demand. At the same time, those are the firms that hire less than the average.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2863~c22e538d33.en.pdf?724eb7da06eccc2cf9b60a16edee50be,2863,3-Nov-23,ECB,11/3/2023
"Pollution havens? Carbon taxes, globalization, and the geography of emissions","Christofer Schroeder, Livio Stracca","This paper studies the impact of national carbon taxes on CO2 emissions. To do so, we run local projections on a cross-country panel dataset, matching measures of emissions of carbon dioxide with information on the introduction of carbon taxes and their implied price. Importantly, we consider both measures of territorial emissions — emissions emitted within a country’s borders — and consumption emissions — emissions emitted anywhere in the world to satisfy domestic demand. We find that carbon taxes reduce territorial emissions over time, but have no significant effect on consumption emissions. Our estimates are robust to propensity-score weighting adjustments and are driven by countries which are more open to trade. Carbon taxes also lead to a modest increase in imports, suggesting that international trade may imply a negative carbon externality. Together, our findings highlight the limitations of national carbon taxes in isolation and the importance of international cooperation in reducing global emissions.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2862~47f293b3f5.en.pdf?f6cd1ae7d0b87e7249261ba83d13fc26,2862,3-Nov-23,ECB,11/3/2023

Its legislative path was marked by two abrupt shifts as the likelihood of climate policy action fell to near zero and then rose to near certainty. We investigate equity price reactions to these two events, which represent major realizations of climate policy transition risk. Our results highlight the heterogeneous nature of climate policy risk exposure. We find sizable reactions that differ by industry as well as across firm-level measures of greenness such as environmental scores and emission intensities. While the financial market response to the IRA was economically significant, it did not lead to instability   financial stress, suggesting that transition risks posed by climate policies even as ambitious as the IRA may be manageable.",https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/working-papers/2023/30/,2023-30,9/1/2023,FED-SANFRANCISCO,11/4/2023
A Comprehensive Macroeconomic Uncertainty Measure for the Euro Area and its Implications to COVID-19,"Mariarosaria Comunale, Anh D. M. Nguyen","This paper develops a new data-driven metric to capture MacroEconomic Uncertainty (MEU) in the euro area. The measure is constructed as the conditional volatility of the unforecastable components of a large set of time series, accounting for the monetary union as well as cross-country heterogeneity. MEU exhibits the largest spike at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak and is noticeably different from other more financial-oriented and policy-driven uncertainty measures. It also reveals a significant increase in inflation uncertainty in 2021-2022. Our BVAR-based analysis shows that an unexpected increase in the MEU has a negative and persistent impact on euro area's industrial production, accounting for 80 percent of its reduction during the first wave of COVID-19, therefore supporting the interpretation of COVID-19 shock as a macroeconomic uncertainty shock. Public debt increases in response to this uncertainty shock. Finally, an increase in MEU negatively affects Emerging Europe countries, contributing the most to the decline in their economic activity during this COVID-19 period.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/03/A-Comprehensive-Macroeconomic-Uncertainty-Measure-for-the-Euro-Area-and-its-Implications-to-540835,WPIEA2023229,"Fri, 03 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/4/2023

The perceived dependence of the federal funds rate on economic conditions varies substantially over time, including over the monetary policy cycle. Forecasters update their perceptions about the Fed’s policy rule in response to monetary policy actions, measured by high-frequency interest rate surprises, suggesting that they have imperfect information about this rule. Monetary policy perceptions matter for monetary transmission, as they affect the sensitivity of interest rates to macroeconomic news, term premia in long-term bonds, and the response of the stock market to monetary policy surprises.

Accounting for Goodwill,"Stefan J. Huber, Charles McClure","A significant portion of a merger’s purchase price is allocated to goodwill. Currently, goodwill is not amortized but tested annually for impairment. When managers care about earnings, goodwill’s accounting treatment can have large effects on future earnings and may influence how much a manager will bid for a target company. We quantify the effects of goodwill accounting by estimating a structural model of corporate takeovers. Our estimates suggest that accrual accounting increases buyout premia by an average of nearly 10 percentage points. If firms needed to amortize goodwill over 10 years, we estimate premia would reduce by 6 percentage points and M&A volume would shrink by 4.29% or $68.6 billion per year. Furthermore, the fraction of private equity acquirers increases by 7.74 percentage points, shifting control over productive assets to the private and financial sector. Our results suggest the accounting treatment for goodwill has a meaningful effect on the market for corporate control.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/accounting-for-goodwill/,2023-142,2-Nov-23,BFI,11/5/2023
Tax Policy and Investment in a Global Economy,"Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, Matthew Smith, Owen Zidar, Eric Zwick","This paper combines administrative tax data and a model of global investment behavior to evaluate the investment and firm valuation effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, the largest corporate tax reduction in the history of the United States. We extend the canonical model of Hall and Jorgenson (1967) to a multinational setting in which a firm produces in domestic and international locations. We use the model to characterize and measure four determinants of domestic investment: domestic and foreign marginal tax rates and cost-of-capital subsidies. We estimate elasticities of domestic investment with respect to each and use them to identify the structural parameters of our model, to quantify which parts of the reform mattered most to investment, and to conduct policy counterfactuals. We have five main findings. First, the TCJA caused domestic investment of firms with the mean tax change to increase by roughly 20% relative to firms experiencing no tax change. Second, the TCJA created large incentives for some U.S. multinationals to increase foreign capital, which rose substantially following the law change. Third, domestic investment also increases in response to foreign incentives, indicating complementarity between domestic and foreign capital in production. Fourth, the general equilibrium long-run effects of the TCJA on the domestic and total capital of U.S. firms are around 6% and 9%, respectively. Finally, in our model, the dynamic labor and corporate tax revenue feedback in the first 10 years is less than 2% of baseline corporate revenue, as investment growth causes both higher labor tax revenues from wage growth and offsetting corporate revenue declines from more depreciation deductions. Consequently, the fall in total corporate tax revenue from the tax cut is close to the static effect.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/tax-policy-and-investment-in-a-global-economy/,2023-141,2-Nov-23,BFI,11/5/2023
A deep dive into the capital channel of risk sharing in the euro area,"Natalia Martín Fuentes, Alexandra Born, Franziska Bremus, Wieger Kastelein, Claudia Lambert","This paper investigates the contribution of capital markets to international risk sharing in the euro area over the 2000Q1-2021Q1 period. It provides three main contributions: First, the estimation of country-specific vector autoregressions (VAR) shows that shock absorption through capital markets remains modest, particularly in the southern euro area. Second, we analyse the geographical patterns of the capital channel. While risk sharing between southern and northern euro area countries led the improvements in income smoothing at the beginning of the 2000s, intra-regional capital flows supported income smoothing in the recent past. Third, based on a panel threshold VAR, we analyse how the composition of external capital positions impacts the capital channel. Long-term portfolio debt assets and liabilities as well as equity liabilities significantly improved income smoothing. The effect is more pronounced for northern countries, in line with their larger cross-border portfolios, when compared to the southern countries. Regarding foreign direct investment, only northern countries benefited from inward positions.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2864~bc6d7b989f.en.pdf?d0fd1a1e0e6260469b2e484b020ffa02,2864,6-Nov-23,ECB,11/6/2023
Convergent Evolution Toward the Joint-Stock Company,"David Le Bris, William N. Goetzmann, Sébastien Pouget","The origin of the modern publicly-held joint-stock company is typically traced to large-scale maritime trading companies in England and the Netherlands in the early 17th century. Highlighting medieval cases in southern Europe, we claim that the joint-stock company likely emerged in several times and places, in response to a similar set of needs and requirements for coordinating large-scale enterprises. These prior appearances support the theory of convergent evolution toward the joint-stock company. We document the different legal genealogies of the various paths, their independence and their socio-economic contexts. These observations have implications for identifying the necessary legal and political background underlying the emergence of the joint-stock company, and for the debate regarding the link between institutions and economic development.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31821,31821,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023

Conventionally elicited inflation expectations consistently exceed aggregated measures constructed under plausible weighting schemes.

Long-term care in the Netherlands,"Pieter Bakx, Eddy Van Doorslaer, Bram Wouterse","We describe the financing and use of long-term care in the Netherlands. Public long-term care insurance is universal and comprehensive; user fees are low compared to other countries. We use linked survey and administrative data to document the distribution of the need for long-term care in the 65+ population, long-term care costs and how they are paid for. The findings reveal that no other country spends more per capita on publicly financed formal care than The Netherlands. A potential reason is that the threshold to receive formal care appears to be lower in the Netherlands than in other countries. Still, a considerable share of the adult population provides informal care. Caregiving is concentrated in specific demographic groups. The costs of informal care provision are considerable, but as a share of total spending on long term care they are smaller than in most developed countries. Adding the costs of informal care to formal care expenditures changes the view on who bears the costs of long-term care.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31823,31823,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023

Universalizing the Access to Long-term Care: Evidence from Spain,"Joan Costa-Font, Sergi Jimenez-Martin, Cristina Vilaplana-Prieto, Analía Viola","Spain together with Scotland are two countries that exhibit the largest expansions in long term care (LTC) in the last two decades, universalizing subsidies and supports. This paper is part of a global effort to provide a snapshot of the trends in LTC use and access, as well as the financing, and organization of the LTC system compared to other higher-income countries. The passage of Act 39/2006 on the Promotion of Personal Autonomy and Care for Dependent Persons (SAAD in Spanish) on December 14th, 2006, universalized coverage for care subsidies and supports, allowing access to care conditioned only on individuals’ assessment of care needs. As a consequence, LTC spending as a percentage of GDP has risen from 0.5% in 2003 to nearly 0.9% in 2019, despite private LTC insurance playing a minor role. Still today, LTC remains heavily reliant on informal care, which is now partially subsidized by a caregiving subsidy as part of SAAD. Long-term care spending in Spain amounts to between 1.27% (conservative estimates) and 1.70% (flexible estimation) of GDP. Finally, the system reveals significant gender imbalances in the provision of care, with women accounting for most caregivers in both formal (87%) and informal (58%) care.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31825,31825,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023

Partisan Traps,"Ethan Bueno de Mesquita, Wioletta Dziuda","Electoral incentives may lead policymakers to eschew opportunities for common-interest reform, focusing instead on zero-sum, partisan policymaking. By forgoing opportunities for common-interest reforms, incumbents may convince their constituents that such reforms are rarely feasible, so that policymaking is primarily about zero-sum, partisan conflict. Voters with such beliefs vote based on ideological alignment, rather than factors such as quality or honesty. This is electorally beneficial for incumbents, who are typically ideologically aligned with their constituents. We capture this logic in an infinite horizon model and characterize the resulting dynamics of politics and policymaking. Equilibrium exhibits partisan traps---voters are pessimistic about common-interest opportunities, politicians behave in a purely partisan manner that shuts down voter learning, and ideologically aligned incumbents are consistently reelected. Partisan traps often occur in equilibrium even when common-interest reforms are in fact frequently feasible. The model shows how elite and mass polarization are intertwined, with politicians engaging in strategically polarized and polarizing behavior which leads to pessimistic beliefs among voters, who come to perceive there to be little political common ground.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31827,31827,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
Preemptive Austerity with Rollover Risk,"Juan Carlos Conesa, Timothy J. Kehoe","By preemptive austerity, we mean a policy that increases taxes to deter potential rollover crises. The policy is so successful that the usual danger signal of a rollover crisis, a high yield on new bonds sold, does not show up because the policy eliminates the danger. Mechanically, high taxes make the safe zone in the model — the set of sovereign debt levels for which the government prefers to repay its debt rather than default — larger. By announcing a high tax rate at the beginning of the period, the government ensures that tax revenue will be high enough to service sovereign debt becoming due, which deters panics by international lenders but is ex-post suboptimal. That is why, as it engages in preemptive austerity, the government continues to reduce the level of debt to a point where, asymptotically, high taxes are no longer necessary.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31828,31828,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
Long-term Care in Japan,"Rong Fu, Toshiaki Iizuka, Haruko Noguchi","Japan, renowned for its significantly aged population, presents a distinctive landscape in elderly care. Notably, there exists no apparent correlation between the economic well-being of the elderly and the limitations they experience in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). In response to the escalating demand for elderly care, Japan introduced the public Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) system in 2000. This comprehensive program offers a wide spectrum of long-term care services, aiming to facilitate aging in place for seniors and alleviate the burdens on informal caregivers. Nevertheless, the LTCI system faces substantial challenges, predominantly related to financial sustainability and a shortage of human resources. Ongoing discussions center on achieving cost-effective service delivery, potential adjustments to premium rates and copayments, especially for individuals with ample financial resources or minimal care needs. Furthermore, debates surround the reduction of the age of eligibility for LTCI, with opposition stemming from intricate financial and structural considerations. Japan grapples with a deficiency of social security contributors and skilled care workers, necessitating endeavors to enhance labor force participation and foster innovation in the long-term care sector.

Asset Pricing in a Low Rate Environment,"Marlon Azinovic, Harold L. Cole, Felix Kubler","We examine asset prices in environments where the risk-free rate lies considerably below the growth rate. To do so, we introduce a tractable model of a production economy featuring heterogeneous trading  technologies, as well as idiosyncratic and aggregate risk. We show that allowing for the possibility of firms exiting is crucial for matching key macroeconomic moments and, simultaneously, the risk-free rate, the market price of risk, and price-earnings ratios. In particular, our model allows us to consider calibrations that match the high observed market price of risk and average interest rates as low as 2-3.5 percent below the average growth rate.  High values for risk aversion or non-standard preferences are not necessary for this. We use the model to examine the wealth distribution and asset prices in economies with very low real rates. We also examine under which conditions realistic calibrations allow for an infinite rollover of government debt. For our benchmark calibration, rollover is impossible even if the average risk-free rate lies 3.5 percent below the average growth rate.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31832,31832,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
Risk Preferences Implied by Synthetic Options,"Ian Dew-Becker, Stefano Giglio","The historical returns on equity index options are well known to be strikingly negative. That is typically explained either by investors having convex marginal utility over stock returns (e.g. crash/variance aversion) or by intermediaries demanding a premium for hedging risk. This paper examines the consistency of those explanations with returns on dynamically replicated, or synthetic, options. Theoretically, it derives conditions under which convex marginal utility leads synthetic options to also have negative excess returns. Empirically, synthetic options have CAPM alphas near zero over the period 1926--2022, in stark contrast to exchange-traded options. Over the last 15 years, returns on traded options have converged to those on synthetic options -- with the variance risk premium shrinking towards zero -- while various drivers of the cost and risk of hedging options exposures have declined, consistent with a model in which intermediaries drive option prices.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31833,31833,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023

The Impact of Fake Reviews on Demand and Welfare,"Jesper Akesson, Robert W. Hahn, Robert D. Metcalfe, Manuel Monti-Nussbaum","Although fake online customer reviews have become prevalent on platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, little is known about how these reviews influence consumer behavior. This paper provides the first experimental estimates of the effects of fake reviews on individual demand and welfare. We conduct an incentive-compatible online experiment with a nationally representative sample of respondents from the United Kingdom (n = 10,000). Consumers are asked to choose a product category, browse a platform resembling Amazon, and select one of five equally priced products. One of the products is of inferior quality, one is of superior quality, and three are of average quality. We randomly allocate participants to variants of the platform: five treatment groups see positive fake reviews for an inferior product, and the control group does not see fake reviews. Moreover, some participants are randomly selected to receive an educational intervention that aims to mitigate the potential effects of fake reviews. Our analysis of the experimental data yields four findings. First, fake reviews make consumers more likely to choose lower-quality products. Second, we estimate that welfare losses from such reviews may be important—on the order of $.12 for each dollar spent in the setting we study. Third, we find that fake reviews have heterogeneous effects. For example, the effect of fake reviews is smaller for those who do not trust customer reviews.

The A.I. Dilemma: Growth versus Existential Risk,Charles I. Jones,"Advances in artificial intelligence (A.I.) are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they may increase economic growth as A.I. augments our ability to innovate. On the other hand, many experts worry that these advances entail existential risk: creating a superintelligence misaligned with human values could lead to catastrophic outcomes, even possibly human extinction. This paper considers the optimal use of A.I. technology in the presence of these opportunities and risks. Under what conditions should we continue the rapid progress of A.I. and under what conditions should we stop?",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31837,31837,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
"Fiscal Influences on Inflation in OECD Countries, 2020-2022","Robert J. Barro, Francesco Bianchi","The fiscal theory of the price level (FTPL) has been active for 30 years, and the interest in this theory grew with the recent global surges in inflation and government spending.  This study applies the FTPL to 37 OECD countries for 2020-2022.  The theory’s centerpiece is the government’s intertemporal budget constraint, which relates a country’s inflation rate in 2020 2022 (relative to a baseline rate) to a composite government-spending variable.  This variable equals the cumulative increase in the ratio of government expenditure to GDP from 2020 to 2022, divided by the ratio of public debt to GDP in 2019 and the duration of the debt in 2019.  This specification has substantial explanatory power for recent inflation rates across 20 non-Euro-zone countries and an aggregate of 17 Euro-zone countries.  The estimated coefficients of the composite spending variable are significantly positive, implying that 40-50% of effective government financing came from the inverse effect of unexpected inflation on the real value of public debt, whereas 50 60% reflected conventional public finance (increases in current or future taxes or cuts in future spending).  Within the Euro area, inflation reacts mostly to the area-wide government-spending variable, not to individual values.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31838,31838,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
Daily Momentum and New Investors in an Emerging Stock Market,"Zhenyu Gao, Wenxi Jiang, Wei A.

This study uncovers the presence of price momentum in daily returns and, through a systematic analysis of trading heterogeneity among investors, links daily momentum to the attention and trading activities of new investors—a phenomenon particularly significant in emerging stock markets. Furthermore, our findings indicate the existence of daily price momentum in various other emerging markets, contrasting with its relative scarcity in developed ones.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31839,31839,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
Foreign Competition and Innovation,Elhanan Helpman,"Empirical studies have found that enhanced foreign competition can encourage or discourage innovation. To address this relationship, I examine a market structure in which a small number of large multi-product oligopolists compete with a large number of small single-product firms in the same industry. The single-product firms are short-lived while the multi-product firms live forever, and the large firms invest in innovation in order to enlarge their product spans. All firms export. I show that an increase in the competitiveness of foreign firms can increase or reduce innovation efforts of a large multi-product firm. Moreover, changes in the incentives to innovate can be different for more-productive and less-productive oligopolists. As a result, aggregate sectoral innovation may rise or decline, depending on the productivity distribution of the oligopolists. I also show that changes in short-term operating profits may not be aligned with changes in the incentives to invest in innovation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31840,31840,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
To Go Electric or To Burn Coal? A Randomized Field Experiment of Informational Nudges,"Hanming Fang, King King Li, Peiyao Shen","Coal heating in residential homes is an important source of indoor air pollution, leading to detrimental health effects. We conduct a randomized field experiment in northern China using three types of SMS campaigns targeting three potential biases that may hinder the adoption of electric heating: a Cost SMS campaign, designed to address the overestimation of electricity expenses; a Health SMS campaign, aimed at addressing the underestimation of health damage associated with coal heating; and a Social Comparison SMS campaign, intended to inform households about the popularity of electric heating. We find that the Cost SMS backfires: it instead leads to a substantial reduction in electric heating, which can be attributed to salience bias induced by the Cost SMS, which drew heightened attention to the cost of electricity. The Health SMS is ineffective for households that underestimate the health damage of coal heating and even backfires for those who expressed little concern about the health consequences. Social Comparison SMS is only effective for a small proportion of households who were concerned about their neighbors' heating choices. Overall, our findings suggest that SMS campaigns targeting these biases are largely ineffective, and caution should be exercised when applying plausible nudge interventions. The findings also suggest that households may be motivated to maintain their beliefs and resist paternalistic interventions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31841,31841,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
On the estimation of distributional household wealth: addressing under-reporting via optimization problems with invariant Gini coefficient,"Janina Engel, Dennis Ohlwerter, Matthias Scherer","The Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) provides valuable information for the monetary policy and financial stability purposes. The dataset shows, however, inconsistencies with National Account (NtlA) statistics, as the aggregated HFCS micro data do usually not match the corresponding NtlA macro data. Therefore, we suggest a solution to close the gap via an optimization problem that aims at preserving for each wealth instrument the level of inequality measured by the Gini coefficient. In addition, a lower and an upper bound of inequality are derived, that can be reached by extreme allocations of the wealth discrepancies across the households. Finally, based on the German HFCS, we compare the findings with another approach suggested in the literature that uses a “multivariate calibration”. The comparison indicates that the multivariate calibration may reallocate households’ wealth beyond the observed discrepancies, thereby leading to Gini coefficients that exceed the analytically derived upper bound of inequality.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2865~2c76fbb179.en.pdf?781d771f6fc810cb59b54f01f9870889,2865,6-Nov-23,ECB,11/6/2023
Evaluating Local Language Models: An Application to Bank Earnings Calls,"Thomas R.

We first introduce new benchmarking tasks for assessing LLM performance in analyzing financial and economic texts and explore the refinements needed to improve its performance. Our benchmarking results suggest local LLMs are a viable tool for general natural language processing analysis of these texts. We then leverage local LLMs to analyze the tone and substance of bank earnings calls in the post-pandemic era, including calls conducted during the banking stress of early 2023. We analyze remarks in bank earnings calls in terms of topics discussed, overall sentiment, temporal orientation, and vagueness.

"Late Payment Fees and Nonpayment in Rental Markets, and Implications for Inflation Measurement: Theoretical Considerations and Evidence","Wesley Janson, Randal J. Verbrugge","Accurate rent measurement is essential for constructing a consumer price index (CPI) and for measuring household welfare. Late payment fees and nonpayment of rent are common components of rental expenditures and thus belong in CPIs. Late payment fees are often excluded; we offer a novel critique. In the US CPI, nonpayment is ostensibly included, but, we show, severely undermeasured. Moreover, the manner of its inclusion renders the CPI extremely sensitive to nonpayment variations; we show how to fix this. Nonpayment undermeasurement suggests at least a +1 ppt overestimate in 2020 CPI shelter inflation. Timely nonpayment and late fee measurement is challenging; we offer a practical solution.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2022r2-late-payment-fees-and-nonpayment-in-rental-markets,20-22R2,11.06.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/7/2023
Hawkish or Dovish Fed? Estimating a Time-Varying Reaction Function of the Federal Open Market Committee's Median Participant,Manuel González-Astudillo and Rakeen Tanvir,"This paper estimates a time-varying reaction function of the median participant of the Federal Open Market Committee, using a Taylor rule with time-varying coefficients estimated on one- to three-year ahead median forecasts of the federal funds rate, inflation, and the unemployment rate from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). We estimate the model with Bayesian methods, incorporating the effective lower bound on the median federal funds rate projections. The results indicate that the monetary policy rule has become significantly more persistent after the pandemic than in the years prior, and it currently reacts strongly to inflation, at more than twice the responsiveness estimated prior to 2020. Our proposed policy rule produces accurate predictions of the median federal funds rate projections in real time for given SEP forecasts of inflation and the unemployment rate, suggesting that the median participant's reaction function is well-represented by our assumed Taylor rule with time-varying coefficients. Our results show that the median participant's reaction function becomes less persistent and less responsive to inflation yet more responsive to the output gap in anticipation of tighter monetary policy conditions, measured by a steeper yield curve. We also find that labor market activity, inflation, and macroeconomic uncertainty correlate significantly with the evolution of the time-varying coefficients of the rule. Finally, we show that in times of a less persistent policy rule or more responsiveness to inflation, markets perceive nominal bonds as better macroeconomic hedges.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/hawkish-or-dovish-fed-estimating-a-time-varying-reaction-function-of-the-federal-open-market-committees-median-participant.htm,2023-070,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/7/2023

Conventionally elicited inflation expectations consistently exceed aggregated measures constructed under plausible weighting schemes.

The effects of labor income risk heterogeneity on the marginal propensity to consume,Ettore Savoia,"Using detailed micro-data, this paper documents that households with lower income risk (and higher income levels) exhibit a higher Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) in response to transitory income shocks, all else being equal. This finding is particularly significant among unconstrained households and supported by models with precautionary saving only if designed to account for the empirically observed negative correlation between income levels and income risk. This interaction generates saving dynamics such that the stationary distribution of wealth among households facing different risk levels is not polarized.Therefore, it is possible to compare their respective MPCs within wealth and identify the reduction in MPC due to labor income risk. Otherwise, the effects of income risk are masked by wealth effects. In neither case, the MPC depends on (permanent, persistent, or current) income levels, whose direct effect on the MPC is always ambiguous. Finally, simulations of targeted fiscal rebates for specific labor categories reveal that governments cannot simultaneously stimulate aggregate demand and mitigate income risk.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2866~a11841e627.en.pdf?e27e8b262c477eb3434f0bd4764d3f29,2866,7-Nov-23,ECB,11/7/2023
Disincentive Effects of Unemployment Insurance Benefits,"Andreas Hornstein, Marios Karabarbounis, André Kurmann, Etienne Lalé and Lien Ta","Unemployment insurance (UI) acts both as a disincentive for labor supply and as a demand stimulus which may explain why empirical studies often find limited effects of UI on employment. This paper provides independent estimates of the disincentive effects arising from the largest expansion of UI in U.S. history, the pandemic unemployment benefits. Using high-frequency data on small restaurants and retailers from Homebase, we control for local demand effects by comparing neighboring businesses that largely share the positive impact of UI stimulus. We find that employment in low-wage businesses recovered more slowly than employment in high-wage businesses in labor markets with larger differences in the relative generosity of pandemic UI benefits. According to a labor search model that replicates the estimated employment differences between low- and high-wage businesses, the disincentive effects from the pandemic UI programs held back the aggregate employment recovery by 4.7 percentage points between April and December 2020.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-11,23-11,3-Nov-23,FED-RICHMOND,11/7/2023

Congestion in Onboarding Workers and Sticky R&D,Justin Bloesch and Jacob P. Weber,"R&D investment spending exhibits a delayed and hump-shaped response to shocks. We show in a simple partial equilibrium model that rapidly adjusting R&D investment is costly if the probability of converting new hires into productive R&D workers (“onboarding”) is decreasing in the number of new hires (“congestion”). Congestion thus causes R&D-producing firms to slowly hire new workers in response to good shocks and hoard workers in response to bad shocks, providing a microfoundation for convex adjustment costs in R&D investment. Using novel, high-frequency productivity data on individual software developers collected from GitHub, a popular online collaboration platform, we provide quantitative evidence for such congestion. Calibrated to this evidence, a sticky-wage new Keynesian model with heterogeneous investment-producing firms subject to congestion in onboarding and no other frictions yields hump-shaped responses of R&D investment to shocks.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1075.html,1075,23-Nov,FED-NEWYORK,11/8/2023
Global and local drivers of Bitcoin trading vis-à-vis fiat currencies,"Paola Di Casola, Maurizio Michael Habib, David Tercero-Lucas","We analyse the drivers of Bitcoin transactions against 44 fiat currencies in the largest peer-to-peer crypto exchanges. Momentum and volatility in the cryptoasset market, as well as volatility and liquidity in global financial markets do matter for Bitcoin trading. There is suggestive evidence of a global crypto cycle driven by speculative motives. However, in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs), Bitcoin seems to offer also transactional benefits, since trading increases when the value of the domestic currency is unstable. Proxies of banking depth and digitalisation are negatively correlated with the currency loadings on the global factor, indicating that crypto-assets may offer a speculative alternative to traditional finance when this is not available, especially in EMDEs where the share of younger risk-prone population is higher. Our results clearly point to potential financial stability risks from cryptoisation in EMDEs with low levels of financial development and unstable fiat currencies.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2868~0c2ad2e6e7.en.pdf?d6c30bb110bfb610a1f23569a7bc920c,2868,8-Nov-23,ECB,11/8/2023
Nothing Gold Can Stay: Artisanal Mine Certifications and Conflict Dynamics in the Congo,"Samuel Chang, Hans Christensen","We examine how conflict-free certifications for artisanal mines—used to comply with provision 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act—affect conflict dynamics in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Certifications are associated with a 9.4% (16.3%) reduction in armed group–initiated conflicts (fatalities) within a 10-kilometer radius of gold mines. After certifications, there is no aggregate reduction in conflict intensity in Eastern DRC territories, but conflicts intensify further away from certified mines, consistent with certifications displacing, not reducing, conflicts. These findings caution that, rather than being relied on as an exclusive solution, certification programs must be part of a concerted effort toward resolving complex geopolitical challenges, such as the humanitarian crisis in the DRC.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/nothing-gold-can-stay-artisanal-mine-certifications-and-conflict-dynamics-in-the-congo/,2023-144,8-Nov-23,BFI,11/8/2023
The bright side of the doom loop: banks’ sovereign exposure and default incentives,"Luis E. Rojas, Dominik Thaler","The feedback loop between sovereign and financial sector insolvency has been identified as a key driver of the European debt crisis and has motivated an array of policy proposals. We revisit this “doom loop” focusing on governments’ incentives to default. To this end, we present a simple 3-period model with strategic sovereign default, where debt is held by domestic banks and foreign investors. The government maximizes domestic welfare, and thus the temptation to default increases with externally-held debt. Importantly, the costs of default arise endogenously from the damage that default causes to domestic banks’ balance sheets. Domestically-held debt thus serves as a commitment device for the government. We show that two prominent policy prescriptions – lower exposure of banks to domestic sovereign debt or a commitment not to bailout banks – can backfire, since default incentives depend not only on the quantity of debt, but also on who holds it. Conversely, allowing banks to buy additional sovereign debt in times of sovereign distress can avert the doom loop. In an extension we show that in the context of a monetary union (such as the euro area) similar unintended negative consequences may arise from the pooling of debt (such as European safe bond aka. ESBies). A backstop by the central bank (such as the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument) can successfully disable the loop if precisely calibrated.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2869~83394dbfea.en.pdf?6007176d2b9d32db6f784d4e28156d26,2869,8-Nov-23,ECB,11/8/2023

Can Everyone Tap into the Housing Piggy Bank? Racial Disparities in Access to Home Equity,"James Conklin, Kristopher Gerardi, Lauren Lambie-Hanson","An earlier version of this paper was posted as Atlanta Fed Working Paper 2022-17. During the 2018–2021 period, Black homeowners’ mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) product applications were rejected at almost double the rate of White homeowners (44% versus 23%), while Hispanic and Asian homeowners also experienced significantly higher denial rates (32% and 30%, respectively). These racial disparities in denials are much larger than those associated with purchase and rate/term refinance mortgage applications. Controlling for loan and borrower characteristics commonly used in the underwriting process significantly reduces the MEW disparities, with the Black-White denial rate gap falling by approximately 83%, and the Hispanic-White gap falling by 73%. Credit scores and debt-to-income ratios are the most important factors explaining the racial gaps, while differences in loan-to-value ratios contribute only modestly. Large disparities remain after controlling for underwriting factors, and these “residual” disparities vary significantly across lenders.

Monetary/fiscal policy regimes in post-war Europe,"Othman Bouabdallah, Pascal Jacquinot, Valeria Patella","In most euro area countries, the monetary/fiscal policy mix is responsible for the changing history of debt and inflation facts. Using a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model with Markov-switching policy rules, we identify three distinct monetary/fiscal regimes in France and Italy: a Passive Monetary-Active Fiscal regime (PM/AF) before the late 80s/early 90s; an Active Monetary-Passive Fiscal regime (AM/PF) with central bank independence and EMU convergence; a third regime with policy rates at the effective lower bound combined with fiscal active behavior to sustain the recovery. Our simulations reveal that the PM/AF regime in France led to price volatility and debt stabilisation, while the AM/PF regime resulted in disinflation and rising debt trajectory.

We exploit cross-sectional heterogeneity in banks’ ex-ante exposure to trade uncertainty and find that an increase in trade uncertainty is associated with a contraction in bank lending to all firms irrespective of the uncertainty that the firms face. This baseline result holds for lending at the intensive and extensive margins. We document two channels underlying the estimated credit supply effect: a wait-and-see channel by which exposed banks assess their borrowers as riskier and reduce the maturity of their loans, and a financial frictions channel by which exposed banks facing relatively higher balance sheet constraints contract lending more. The decline in credit supply has real effects: firms that borrow from more exposed banks experience lower debt growth and investment rates.

FINEX - A New Workhorse Model for Macroeconomic Forecasting and Policy Analysis,"Andrew Berg, Yaroslav Hul, Philippe D Karam, Adam Remo, Diego Rodriguez Guzman","This paper presents a semi-structural macroeconomic model aimed at facilitating policy analysis and forecasting, primarily in countries with imperfect capital mobility and hybrid monetary policy regimes. Compared to earlier gap-trend projection models, the Forecasting Model of Internal and External Balance (FINEX) contains three main innovations: it accentuates external and internal balances; explicitly incorporates fiscal policy; and partly endogenizes the main trends. FINEX thus covers a broad set of policy instruments, including foreign exchange interventions (FXI), capital flow management measures (CFM), as well as common fiscal policy instruments. The model incorporates insights from the recent DSGE literature, while maintaining a more accessible gap-trend structure that lends itself to practical policy applications.

Quantifying the Revenue Yields from Tax Administration Reforms,"Hassan Adan, Jean-Marc B. Atsebi, Nikolay Gueorguiev, Jiro Honda, Manabu Nose","Despite the criticality of tax administration (TA) reforms in enhancing domestic revenue mobilization, few studies have attempted to quantify the revenue impact of such reforms. This paper fills this gap by estimating the revenue yields associated with various tax administration capabilities, based on the International Survey on Tax Administration (ISORA), the Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT), and TA reform episodes datasets (identified by Akitoby et al., 2020). It uses a Hausman-Taylor cross-country panel regression and an event study for specific TA reform episodes. Our results (using the ISORA data) show that an increase in the overall strength of TA from the 40th percentile to the 60th percentile is associated with an increase in tax revenue by 1.8 pp. of GDP (with a 95 percent confidence range of 0.5‒2.6 pp. of GDP). Similarly, the event-study assessment shows that sustained TA reforms led to an increase in tax revenues between 2 to 3 pp. of GDP, in line with the experience in three country cases (Jamaica, Rwanda, and Senegal). Also, the revenue yields are increasing over time to more than 3 pp. of GDP after the 6th year following a comprehensive reform.

The Economic Consequences of Social Unrest: Evidence from Initial Public Offerings,"Philip Barrett, Thomas J. Boulton, Terry D. Nixon","Prior research attributes negative stock market performance following episodes of social unrest to elevated uncertainty. However, social unrest does not solely increase uncertainty, but separately acts to decrease investor sentiment. To determine which effect dominates, we study initial public offering (IPO) underpricing, which responds differently to changes to uncertainty and investor sentiment. Consistent with the notion that social unrest dampens investor sentiment, we find robust evidence that IPO first-day returns are lower during times of greater social unrest. Limits to arbitrage intensify the negative relation between social unrest and underpricing. Notably, strong institutional frameworks mitigate the impact of social unrest on underpricing, suggesting that quality institutions weaken the link between investor sentiment and returns.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/10/The-Economic-Consequences-of-Social-Unrest-Evidence-from-Initial-Public-Offerings-541410,WPIEA2023232,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/10/2023
The Optimal Supply of Central Bank Reserves under Uncertainty,"Gara  Afonso, Gabriele La Spada, Thomas M. Mertens, and John C. Williams","This paper provides an analytically tractable theoretical framework to study the optimal supply of central bank reserves when the demand for reserves is uncertain and nonlinear. We fully characterize the optimal supply of central bank reserves and associated market equilibrium. We find that the optimal supply of reserves under uncertainty is greater than that absent uncertainty. With a sufficient degree of uncertainty, it is optimal to supply a level of reserves that is abundant (on the flat portion of the demand curve) absent shocks. The optimal mean spread between the market interest rate and administered rates under uncertainty may be higher or lower than that absent uncertainty. Our model is consistent with the observation that the variability of interest rate spreads is a function of the level of reserves.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1077.html,1077,23-Nov,FED-NEWYORK,11/10/2023
Do banks practice what they preach? Brown lending and environmental disclosure in the euro area,"Leonardo Gambacorta, Salvatore Polizzi, Alessio Reghezza, Enzo Scannella","This study examines whether the level of environmental disclosure in banks’ financial reports matches less brown lending portfolios. Using granular credit register data and detailed information on firm-level greenhouse gas emission intensities, we find a negative relationship between environmental disclosure and brown lending. However, this effect is contingent on the tone of the financial report. Banks that express a negative tone, reflecting genuine concern and awareness of environmental risks, tend to lend less to more polluting firms. Conversely, banks that express a positive tone, indicating lower concern and awareness of environmental risks, tend to lend more to polluting firms. These findings highlight the importance of increasing awareness of environmental risks, so that banks perceive them as a critical and urgent pressing threat, leading to a genuine commitment to act as environmentally responsible lenders.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2872~b91ebffb71.en.pdf?b21c1346272b8634718a98691ff7b90f,2872,10-Nov-23,ECB,11/10/2023
Did Fintech Loans Default More During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Were Fintech Firms “Cream-Skimming” the Best Borrowers?,"Julapa Jagtiani, Catharine Lemieux, Brandon Goldstein","Studies of fintech lending have shown that their digital access and ability to leverage alternative data have increased accessibility in underserved areas, enabled consumers with thin credit files to obtain credit, and provided a lower cost alternative to long-term credit card financing. This paper exams three questions: (1) Do proprietary loan rating systems accurately predict the likelihood of default? (2) Can a proprietary loan rating system, leveraging alternative data, that was developed in a favorable economic period continue to perform well under adverse economic conditions (such as the COVID-19 pandemic)? (3) Have fintechs been “cream skimming,” i.e., underpricing the cost of credit to top-tier customers? This study uses data from LendingClub, one of the largest fintech lenders in the personal loan market. We find that LendingClub’s loan rating system is superior to traditional measures of credit risk when predicting the likelihood of default and that the loan rating system continued to perform well during the pandemic period. Finally, we find no evidence of cream skimming.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/banking-and-financial-markets/did-fintech-loans-default-more-during-the-covid-19-pandemic,23-26,30-Oct-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,11/10/2023

"Heterogeneous Districts,  Interests, and Trade Policy","Kishore Gawande, Pablo M. Pinto and Santiago Pinto","Congressional districts are political entities with heterogeneous trade policy preferences due to their diverse economic structures. Representation of these interests in Congress is a crucial aspect of trade policymaking that is missing in canonical political economy models of trade. In this paper, we underscore the influence of districts by developing a political economy model of trade with region-specific factors. Using 2002 data from U.S. Congressional Districts, we first characterize the unobserved district-level demand for protection. Extending the model beyond the small country assumption to account for export interests as a force countering protection, we develop a model of national tariff-setting. The model predictions are used to estimate the welfare weights implied by tariff and non-tariff measures enacted nationally. Our supply-side explanation for trade policy, while complementing Grossman and Helpman (1994), reveals district and industry-level patterns of winners and losers, central to understanding the political consequences of trade and the backlash against globalization.

The Pass-through of Wages to Consumer Prices in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Sectoral Data in the U.S.,"Moya Chin, Li Lin","We study the pass-through of labor costs to prices using a novel data-set that links industry-level wages to sectoral consumer prices through input-output tables. Pass-through increased during the COVID-19 pandemic recovery, temporarily in goods and persistently in services. Our analysis suggests that the elevated pass-through contributed at least 0.8 percentage points to goods inflation in 2021 and 0.7 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points to services inflation in 2021 and 2022, respectively. We find that the increase in pass-through reflects elevated demand in goods sectors and firms' difficulty in absorbing high wage growth in services sectors. The analysis suggests it will take a reduction in wage growth to bring PCE inflation back to target.

Trade Diversion Effects from Global Tensions—Higher Than We Think,"Mengqi Wang, Swarnali A Hannan","The paper builds a unique industry-level dataset by combining Mexico’s nationally sourced inputoutput data (INEGI) with cross-country sources (WIOD, UN Comtrade). Using this dataset to exploit higher supply linkages across a larger number of industries than what is available in cross-country sources, the paper estimates the trade diversion effect on Mexico’s exports to the U.S. from two episodes, with a focus on the first: the U.S.-China trade tension in 2018 and the U.S. sanctions on Russia in 2014. Difference-in-differences, local projections and few other empirical methodologies are used. For the first episode, the paper finds higher trade diversion effects than estimates in literature. Output tariff plays an important role, and there is some evidence of a positive impact through downstream tariffs. The effects are stronger when nationally sourced input-output data is used compared to those derived from cross-country sources. Importantly, the magnitude of trade diversion across industries does not depend on Mexico’s industry-level trade exposure to the U.S., but rather on the U.S. tariff changes on Chinese goods, the decrease in imports from China, product substitutability with Chinese products, and (weakly) on Mexico’s GVC integration. Similarly, for the second episode, the paper finds positive trade diversion effects. Overall, the findings suggest that trade diversion effect might be higher than previously thought and the proper accounting of dataset and supply linkages makes a difference.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/10/Trade-Diversion-Effects-from-Global-Tensions-Higher-Than-We-Think-539680,WPIEA2023234,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/10/2023
Do Water Audits Work?,"Jesper Akesson, Robert W. Hahn, Rajat Kochhar, Robert D. Metcalfe","Water suppliers are showing greater interest in using different mechanisms to promote conservation. One such mechanism is conducting home water audits, which involves assessing water use and providing tailored suggestions for conserving water for residential customers. Yet, very little is known about the economic impacts of these water audits. This paper helps fill this gap by implementing a natural field experiment in the United Kingdom. The experiment involves randomly allocating 45,000 water customers to a control group or to treatment groups that receive different behavioral encouragements to take-up an online water audit. Our analysis yields three main findings. First, encouraging subjects to participate in an audit with financial incentives reduces household consumption by about 17 percent over two months. Furthermore, we find that the size of the financial incentive used to encourage conservation matters for take-up, but not conservation. Second, notwithstanding these improvements in water conservation, the per capita net benefits of the intervention are close to zero under a wide range of assumptions. We also implement a marginal value of public funds approach that considers benefits and costs and we reach a similar conclusion. Third, we find that targeting of high users could double the effectiveness of the financial incentive interventions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31831,31831,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Designing Difference in Difference Studies With Staggered Treatment Adoption: Key Concepts and Practical Guidelines,"Seth M. Freedman, Alex Hollingsworth, Kosali I.

A growing methods literature points out potential problems with DID estimators when treatment is staggered in adoption and varies with time. Despite this, no practical guide exists for addressing these new critiques in public health research. We illustrate these new DID concepts with step-by-step examples, code, and a checklist. We draw insights by comparing the simple 2 × 2 DID design (single treatment group, single control group, two time periods) with more complex cases: additional treated groups, additional time periods of treatment, and with treatment effects possibly varying over time. We outline newly uncovered threats to causal interpretation of DID estimates and the solutions the literature has proposed, relying on a decomposition that shows how the more complex DID are an average of simpler 2X2 DID sub-experiments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31842,31842,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Life and Death at the Margins of Society: The Mortality of the U.S. Homeless Population,"Bruce D. Meyer, Angela Wyse, Ilina Logani","This paper examines the relationship between extreme socioeconomic disadvantage and poor health by providing the first detailed and accurate picture of mortality patterns among people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. Our analyses center on 140,000 people who were sheltered or unsheltered homeless during the 2010 Census, by far the largest sample ever used to study this population and the only sample designed to be nationally representative. These individuals, along with housed comparison groups, are linked to Social Security Administration data on all-cause mortality from 2010-2022 to estimate the magnitude of health disparities associated with homelessness. We find that non-elderly people experiencing homelessness have 3.5 times the mortality risk of those who are housed, accounting for differences in demographic characteristics and geography, and that a 40-year-old homeless person faces a similar mortality risk to a housed person nearly twenty years older. Our results reveal notable patterns in relative mortality risk by age, race, gender, and Hispanic ethnicity and suggest that within the homeless population, employment, higher incomes, and more extensive observed family connections are associated with lower mortality. The mortality hazard of homeless individuals rose by 33 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase that, while similar in proportional terms to the increase for the housed population, affected a much larger share of the homeless population due to their substantially elevated baseline mortality rate. These findings elucidate the persistent hardships associated with homelessness and show that the well-documented gradient between health and poverty persists into the extreme lower tail of socioeconomic disadvantage.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31843,31843,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Do Two Wrongs Make a Right? Measuring the Effect of Publications on Science Careers,"Donna K.

We use Gold Standard data created to validate the publication match quality and compare these measures to publications assigned by a machine-learning algorithm developed by Thomson Reuters (now Clarivate). Our econometric model demonstrates that publications likely suffer from non-classical measurement error. Using horse race and instrumental variable models, we confirm that the Gold Standard data are relatively free from measurement error but show that the Clarivate data suffer from non-classical measurement error. We employ a variety of methods to adjust the Clarivate data for false negatives and false positives and demonstrate that with these adjustments the data produce estimates very similar to the Gold Standard. However, these adjustments are not as useful when publications are used as a dependent variable. We recommend using subsamples of the data that have better match quality when using the Clarivate data as a dependent variable.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31844,31844,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Differences in How and Why Social Comparison and Real-Time Feedback Impact Resource Use: Evidence from a Field Experiment,"Mark A. Andor, Lorenz Goette, Michael K. Price, Anna Schulze Tilling, Lukas Tomberg","We compare the behavior and welfare effects of two popular interventions for resource conservation. The first intervention is social comparison reports (SC), which primarily provide consumers with information motivating behavioral change. The second intervention is real-time feedback (RTF), which primarily provides consumers with information facilitating behavioral change. In a field experiment with around 1,000 participants, we directly observe the interventions’ effects on participants’ behavior. Further, we elicit participants’ willingness to pay for receiving the interventions, both before and after having experienced them for one month. We find that SC leads to a reduction in water use per shower by 9.4%, RTF by 28.8%, and the combination (BOTH) by 35.0%. Our willingness to pay results show that all interventions are highly valued by participants and that willingness to pay for RTF and BOTH is significantly higher than for SC. Furthermore, we find that the valuation of the interventions do not change following one-month experience. Our results suggest that while both interventions improve welfare, providing consumers with information facilitating behavioral change achieves a higher impact and a slightly higher welfare increase than providing consumers with information motivating behavioral change.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31845,31845,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

Using US administrative data, we show that both measures negatively predict earnings growth of individual incumbent workers.

However, we find positive effects of labor-augmenting technologies on occupation-level employment and wage bills. A model featuring labor-saving and labor-augmenting technologies with vintage-specific human capital quantitatively matches these patterns.

Open-ended interviews of North Carolina public school teachers reaffirm these findings.

The Active Role of the Natural Rate of Unemployment during Cyclical Recoveries,"Robert E. Hall, Marianna Kudlyak","We propose that the natural rate of unemployment has an active role in the business cycle, in contrast to the prevailing view that the rate is essentially constant. We demonstrate that this tendency to treat the natural rate as near-constant would explain the surprisingly low slope of the Phillips curve. We show that the natural rate closely tracked the actual rate during the long recovery that began in 2009 and ended in 2020. We explain how the common finding of research in the Phillips-curve framework of low---often extremely low---response of inflation to unemployment could be the result of fairly close tracking of the natural rate and the actual rate in recoveries. Our interpretation of the data contrasts to that of most Phillips-curve studies, that conclude that inflation has little relation to unemployment. We suggest that the flat Phillips curve is an illusion caused by assuming that the natural rate of unemployment has little or no movement during recoveries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31848,31848,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Policymakers' Uncertainty,"Anna Cieslak, Stephen Hansen, Michael McMahon, Song Xiao","Uncertainty is a ubiquitous concern emphasized by policymakers. We study how uncertainty affects decision-making by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). We distinguish between the notion of Fed-managed uncertainty vis-a-vis uncertainty that emanates from within the economy and which the Fed takes as given. A simple theoretical framework illustrates how Fed-managed uncertainty introduces a wedge between the standard Taylor-type policy rule and the optimal decision. Using private Fed deliberations, we quantify the types of uncertainty the FOMC perceives and their effects on its policy stance. The FOMC's expressed inflation uncertainty strongly predicts a more hawkish policy stance that is not explained either by the Fed's macroeconomic forecasts or by public uncertainty proxies. We rationalize these results with a model of inflation tail risks and argue that the effect of uncertainty on the FOMC's decisions reflects policymakers' concern with maintaining credibility for the inflation anchor.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31849,31849,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
What about Japan?,"Yi-Li Chien, Harold L.

We quantify the impact of Japan’s low-rate policies on its government and households. Because of the duration mismatch on the government balance sheet, the government’s fiscal space expands when real rates decline, allowing the government to keep its promises to older Japanese households. A typical younger Japanese household does not have enough duration in its portfolio to continue to finance its spending plan and will be worse off. Low-rate policies tax younger, poorer and less financially sophisticated households.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31850,31850,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Implications of Asset Market Data for Equilibrium Models of Exchange Rates,"Zhengyang Jiang, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Hanno Lustig","We characterize the relation between exchange rates and their macroeconomic fundamentals without committing to a specific model of preferences, endowment or menu of traded assets. When investors can trade home and foreign currency risk-free bonds,  the exchange rate appreciates in states that are worse for home investors than foreign investors. This prediction is at odds with the empirical evidence and can only be overturned if the deviations from U.I.P. are large and exchange rates are highly predictable. Without bond Euler equation wedges, it is impossible to match the empirical exchange rate cyclicality (the Backus-Smith puzzle) and the deviations from U.I.P. (the Fama puzzle) as well as the lack of predictability (the Meese-Rogoff puzzle). To relax this trade-off, we need Euler equation wedges consistent with a home currency bias, home bond convenience yields or financial repression.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31851,31851,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
A Framework for Geoeconomics,"Christopher Clayton, Matteo Maggiori, Jesse Schreger","Governments use their countries’ economic strength from existing financial and trade relationships  to achieve geopolitical and economic goals. We refer to this practice as geoeconomics. We build a framework based on three core ingredients: input output linkages, limited contract enforceability, and externalities. Geoeconomic power arises from the ability to jointly exercise threats arising from separate economic activities.  Being able to retaliate against a deviating country across multiple arenas, often involving indirect threats from third parties also being pressured, increases the off equilibrium threats and, thus, helps in equilibrium to increase enforceability. A world hegemon, like the United States, exerts its power on firms and governments in its economic network by asking these entities to take costly actions that benefit the hegemon. We characterize the optimal actions and show that they take the form of mark-ups on goods or higher rates on lending, but also import restrictions and tariffs. The input-output amplification makes controlling some sectors more valuable for the hegemon since changes in the allocation of these strategic sectors have a larger influence on the world economy. This formalizes the idea of economic coercion as a combination of strategic pressure and costly actions. We apply the framework to two leading examples: national security externalities and the Belt and Road Initiative.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31852,31852,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

Safety Reviews on Airbnb: An Information Tale,"Aron Culotta, Ginger Zhe Jin, Yidan Sun, Liad Wagman","Consumer reviews, especially those expressing concerns of product quality, are crucial for the credibility of online platforms. However, reviews that criticize a product or service may also dissuade buyers from using the platform, creating an incentive to blur the visibility of critical reviews.  Using Airbnb and official crime data in five major US cities, we find that both reviews and self experiences concerning the safety of a listing's vicinity decrease guest bookings on the platform. Counterfactual simulations suggest that a complete removal of vicinity safety reviews (VSR) would hurt guests but increase revenues from reservations on Airbnb, with positive sorting towards listings formerly with VSR. Conversely, incorporating VSR in a listing's overall ratings or highlighting VSR could generate opposite effects. Either way, the interests of consumers are not always aligned with the interests of a revenue-centric platform. Because VSR are more closely correlated with official crime statistics in low-income and minority neighborhoods, our findings suggest that suppressing or highlighting VSR would have different effects on different neighborhoods.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31855,31855,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

The Long-run Effect of Air Pollution on Survival,"Tatyana Deryugina, Julian Reif","Many environmental hazards produce health effects that take years to arise, but quasi-experimental studies typically measure outcomes and treatment over short time periods. We develop a new approach to overcome this challenge and use it to gauge the effect of exposure to air pollution on US life expectancy. Using changes in wind direction as an instrument for daily sulfur dioxide levels, we first characterize the short-run mortality effects of acute exposure during the time period 1972-1988. Exposure causes two distinct mortality patterns: a short-run mortality displacement effect, and a persistent accelerated aging effect. We then incorporate our estimates into a flexible health production model to quantify the lifelong effects of chronic air pollution exposure for a cohort born in 1972. Model calculations of the effect of chronic exposure on life expectancy are 7-8 times larger than the effect implied by simple extrapolation of our short-run empirical estimates. Ninety percent of the survival benefits accrue after the first fifty years of life, implying that most of the 1970 Clean Air Act's health benefits have yet to emerge for cohorts born after its passage.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31858,31858,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

Trade Uncertainty and U.S. Bank Lending,"Ricardo Correa, Julian di Giovanni, Linda S. Goldberg, Camelia Minoiu",This paper uses U.S. loan-level credit register data and the 2018–2019 Trade War to test for the effects of international trade uncertainty on domestic credit supply. We exploit cross-sectional heterogeneity in banks’ ex-ante exposure to trade uncertainty and find that an increase in trade uncertainty is associated with a contraction in bank lending to all firms irrespective of the uncertainty that the firms face. This baseline result holds for lending at the intensive and extensive margins. We document two channels underlying the estimated credit supply effect: a wait-and-see channel by which exposed banks assess their borrowers as riskier and reduce the maturity of their loans and a financial frictions channel by which exposed banks facing relatively higher balance sheet constraints contract lending more. The decline in credit supply has real effects: firms that borrow from more exposed banks experience lower debt growth and investment rates. These effects are stronger for firms that are more reliant on bank finance.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31860,31860,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Long-term Care in Italy,"Agar Brugiavini, Ludovico Carrino, Giacomo Pasini","The provision of long-term care (LTC) for senior citizens in Italy is at the center of the recent policy debate. Italy has witnessed a spectacular increase in the share of people aged 65 and over and in particular of people aged 80 and over, which could translate in large increases in the number of people in need of care. We show that individuals who are in need of LTC have lower economic resources than the average, so that many frail older people have little financial means to pay out-of-pocket for formal care. In fact, publicly provided care is highly fragmented, with stark differences emerging in terms of coverage and generosity across Italian regions. Hence, the supply of LTC is relying heavily on the informal support of members of the family, especially women, at the same time formal care is characterised by a significant underground economy of unskilled carers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31861,31861,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

When do Treasuries Earn the Convenience Yield? — A Hedging Perspective,"Viral V. Acharya, Toomas Laarits","We document that the convenience yield of U.S. Treasuries exhibits properties that are consistent with a hedging perspective of safe assets. The convenience yield tends to be low when the covariance of Treasury returns with the aggregate stock market returns is high. A decomposition of the aggregate stock-bond covariance into terms corresponding to the convenience yield, the frictionless risk-free rate, and default risk reveals that the covariance between stock returns and the convenience yield itself drives the effect in a substantive capacity. We show the convenience yield is reduced with heightened inflation expectations that erode the hedging properties of U.S. Treasuries and other fixed-income money-like assets, inducing a switch to alternatives such as gold; it is also reduced immediately prior to debt-ceiling standoffs and with increases in Treasury supply.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31863,31863,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

The Deposit Business at Large vs. Small Banks,"Adrien d&#039;Avernas, Andrea L. Eisfeldt, Can Huang, Richard Stanton, Nancy Wallace","The deposit business differs at large versus small banks.  We provide a parsimonious model and extensive empirical evidence supporting the idea that much of the variation in deposit-pricing  behavior between large and small banks reflects differences in ""preferences and technologies.""  Large banks offer superior liquidity services but lower deposit rates, and locate where customers value their services.  In addition to receiving a lower level of deposit rates on average, customers of large banks exhibit lower demand elasticities with respect to deposit rate spreads.  As a result, despite the fact that the locations of large-bank branches have demographics typically associated with greater financial sophistication, large-bank customers earn lower average deposit rates.  Our explanation for deposit pricing behavior challenges the idea that deposit pricing is mainly driven by pricing power derived from the large observed degree of concentration in the banking industry.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31865,31865,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Job Transitions and Employee Earnings After Acquisitions: Linking Corporate and Worker Outcomes,"David Arnold, Kevin S. Milligan, Terry Moon, Amirhossein Tavakoli","This paper connects changes in employer characteristics through job transitions to employee earnings following mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Using firm balance sheet data linked to individual earnings data in Canada and a matched difference-in-differences design, we find that after M&As acquirers expand while targets shrink substantially relative to their matched control groups. Additionally, profit margins decrease for both acquirers and targets in the medium run. Furthermore, workers at target firms suffer losses in earnings, and this decline in earnings is entirely driven by workers who move to other firms after an M&A event. We find that workers leaving target firms after M&As move to larger firms with higher wage premiums, but with much worse match qualities on average. Taken together, it appears that job transitions to employers with poor match qualities primarily explain the post-M&A decline in worker earnings in our setting.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31866,31866,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
The Impact of Right-to-Work Laws on Long Hours and Work Schedules,"Osea Giuntella, Rania Gihleb, Jian Qi Tan","Unions play a crucial role in determining wages and employment outcomes. However, union bargaining power may also have important effects on non-pecuniary working conditions. We study the effects of right-to-work laws, which removed agency shop protection and weakened union powers on long hours and non-standard work schedules that may adversely affect workers' health and safety. We exploit variation in the timing of enactment across US states and compare workers in bordering counties across adopting states and states that did not adopt the laws yet. Using the stacked approach to difference-in-differences estimates proposed by Cengiz et al. (2019), we find evidence that right-to-work laws increased the share of workers working long hours by 6%, while there is little evidence of an impact on hourly wages. The effects on long hours are larger in more unionized sectors (i.e. construction, manufacturing, and transportation). While the likelihood of working non-standard hours increases for particular sectors (education and public administration), there is no evidence of a significant increase in the overall sample.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31867,31867,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Identification using Revealed Preferences in Linearly Separable Models,"Nikhil Agarwal, Pearl Z. Li, Paulo J.

We develop general identification results for a large class of models that have a linearly separable payoff structure. Our model allows for both discrete and continuous choice sets. It incorporates widely studied models such as discrete and hedonic choice models, auctions, school choice mechanisms, oligopoly pricing and trading games. We characterize the identified set and show that point identification can be achieved either if the choice set is sufficiently rich or if a variable that shifts preferences is available. Our identification results also suggests an estimation approach.

Long-term Care in Germany,"Johannes Geyer, Axel H. Börsch-Supan, Peter Haan, Elsa Perdrix","This chapter provides an overview of the German long-term care insurance. We document care needs and wellbeing of the elderly population. Moreover, we provide a detailed description of the German long-term care institutions (sources of finance and types of benefits), the professional care work force, and informal caregivers. Finally, we document expenditures on long-term care and estimate the value of informal care. The cost of long-term care for the elderly (65+), including both cost of nursing home and home health agency, reached 61 billion euro in 2019. Half of these spending are for nursing homes while only about 22.5% of beneficiaries use these institutions. Out-of-pocket spending differs greatly between modes of care. Out-of-pocket expenditures make up only about 7% of total expenditures for home care. In nursing homes, 41% of expenditures are out-of-pocket payment. Most of the expenditures are covered by the long-term care insurance. The share of other governmental schemes in expenditures for inpatient care is relatively high. This is explained by a high rate of benefit recipients who cannot afford co-payments for nursing homes: about one-third of all nursing home residents receive means- and wealth-tested social assistance. If we add the costs of informal care the share of privately financed care amounts to nearly 60% of total expenditures.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31870,31870,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
The Effects of the Federal Reserve Chair’s Testimony on Interest Rates and Stock Prices,"Matthew V. Gordon, Kurt G. Lunsford","We study how congressional testimony about monetary policy by the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System affects interest rates and stock prices. First, we study testimony associated with the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Reports (MPRs) to Congress. Testimony for a particular MPR is usually given on two days, one day for each chamber of Congress. We separately study the first day and second day of MPR testimony. We also study testimonies not associated with MPRs but that are still related to monetary policy. We find that first-day MPR testimonies cause the largest movements in interest rates and generate negative co-movement between interest rates and stock prices. Testimonies not associated with MPRs have similar but weaker effects. Second-day MPR testimonies cause the smallest movements in interest rates and generate no co-movement between interest rates and stock prices.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2326-federal-reserve-chairs-testimony-effects,23-26,11.13.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/14/2023
Black Mayors and Crime,Craig Sylvera,"Local elections are often contested on the grounds of public safety, but do elected officials have any power to curb crime or poor police behavior? Black mayors have particular interest in the issue because Black communities are routinely victimized by high levels of crime and fragile police-community relations. Using data on elections of first-time Black mayors, I find that police forces add more Black officers, a finding that is especially true for mayors with executive authority. Officers arrest 48 fewer potential Black offenders per 10,000 Black residents for crimes where they have the ability to exercise discretion, a finding commensurate with the overall reduction in crime. This effect is not visible for similar white arrests. Using changes in the levels of arrests and officers induced by pivotal Black elections, I then estimate the correlation of an additional officer on race-specific arrests. An additional Black officer is related to large reductions in discretionary Black arrests, perhaps suggesting increasing the presence and visibility of Black officers may offer a solution to the “over-policing, under-policing” problem Black communities face.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2327-black-mayors-and-crime,23-27,11.14.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/14/2023

(2022) for the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Lifetime earnings are a particularly important measure of well-being, with relevance for wealth accumulation among other economic and social outcomes, but they are under-studied in the context of racial disparities. We describe how the different components of lifetime earnings—including annual earnings of workers, number of working household members, and number of years of employment during the working life—vary by race. We then decompose the differences in lifetime earnings using the recentered influence function and show that human capital-related variables, including educational attainment and years of full-time employment, account for most of the observed differences in lifetime earnings between White, Black, and Hispanic families. We also explore the contribution of business ownership to explained disparities in lifetime earnings and find that it is significant and that business ownership’s explanatory power increases at the top of the lifetime-earnings distribution.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/decomposing-lifetime-earnings-differences-between-white-black-and-hispanic-families,23-14,14-Nov-23,FED-BOSTON,11/14/2023
Fund fragility: the role of investor base,"Nolwenn Allaire, Johannes Breckenfelder, Marie Hoerova","Using security-by-security data on investor holdings in the euro area, we study run dynamics across different fund-shares of the same fund during the unprecedented liquidity crisis in March 2020. For an average bond or equity mutual fund-share, households, other euro area funds, and the foreign sector each represent about a quarter of the total holdings. Insurance companies hold another 14%, with all other investors combined (banks, non-financial corporations, pension funds, etc.) accounting for less than 10% of holdings. Analyzing bond funds, we show that fund-shares with higher ownership by other funds suffered substantially higher outflows (by 6 percentage points), while fund-shares with higher ownership by households had substantially lower outflows (by 5 percentage points) compared to the other fund-shares within the same fund. This gap is not driven by time-varying differences in fund performance. Results for equity funds are similar, although they faced substantially smaller outflows, coupled with much larger declines in performance, compared to bond funds. Our findings suggest that a collective “dash for cash” by consumers and firms in need of liquidity at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic was not the source of mutual fund fragility. Instead, the most run-prone investor type turned out to be the fund sector itself.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2874~af5c7c3678.en.pdf?dd12bcb5085c976c78c68a4f6ebc08b9,2874,14-Nov-23,ECB,11/14/2023
Loss sharing in central clearinghouses: winners and losers,"Christian Kubitza, Loriana Pelizzon, Mila Getmansky Sherman","Central clearing counterparties (CCPs) were established to mitigate default losses resulting from counterparty risk in derivatives markets. In a parsimonious model, we show that clearing benefits are distributed unevenly across market participants. Loss sharing rules determine who wins or loses from clearing. Current rules disproportionately benefit market participants with flat portfolios. Instead, those with directional portfolios are relatively worse off, consistent with their reluctance to voluntarily use central clearing. Alternative loss sharing rules can address cross-sectional disparities in clearing benefits. However, we show that CCPs may favor current rules to maximize fee income, with externalities on clearing participation.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2873~8ad2dc489a.en.pdf?73348a845dba7f25a1ace7cb419c5fa4,2873,14-Nov-23,ECB,11/14/2023
Household Liquidity and Macroeconomic Stabilization: Evidence from Mortgage Forbearance,Sean Chanwook Lee and Omeed Maghzian,"We estimate the impact of household liquidity provision on macroeconomic stabilization using the 2020 CARES Act mortgage forbearance program. We leverage intermediation frictions in forbearance induced by mortgage servicers to identify the effect of reducing short-term payments with little change in long-term debt obligations on local labor market outcomes. Following statewide business reopenings, a 1 percentage point increase in the share of mortgages in forbearance leads to a 30 basis point increase in monthly employment growth in nontradable industries. In a model incorporating geographical heterogeneity in intermediation frictions, these responses imply a household-level marginal propensity to consume out of increased liquidity that aligns with existing estimates for direct fiscal transfers. The implied debt-financed fiscal multiplier effects of forbearance are sizable but depend on the repayment terms of deferred payments and the monetary policy stance.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/household-liquidity-and-macroeconomic-stabilization-evidence-from-mortgage-forbearance,23-12,14-Nov-23,FED-BOSTON,11/14/2023
Demographics and Real Interest Rates Across Countries and Over Time,"Carlos Carvalho, Andrea Ferrero, Felipe Mazin, Fernanda Nechio","We explore the implications of demographic trends for the evolution of real interest rates across countries and over time. To that end, we develop a tractable three-country general equilibrium model with imperfect capital mobility and country-specific demographic trends. We calibrate the model to study how low-frequency movements in a country's real interest rate depend on its own and other countries' demographic factors, given a certain degree of financial integration. The more financially integrated a country is, the higher the sensitivity of its real interest rate to global developments is, and the less its own real rate determinants matter. We then estimate panel error correction models relating real interest rates to many of its possible determinants-demographics included-imposing some restrictions motivated by lessons from our structure model. Results corroborate the importance of accounting for time-varying financial integration, and show global factors and life expectancy are relevant determinants of real interest rates.",https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/working-papers/2023/32/,2023-32,10/1/2023,FED-SANFRANCISCO,11/15/2023
The Active Role of the Natural Rate of Unemployment during Cyclical Recoveries,"Robert E. Hall, Marianna Kudlyak","We propose that the natural rate of unemployment has an active role in the business cycle, in contrast to the prevailing view that the rate is essentially constant. We demonstrate that this tendency to treat the natural rate as near-constant would explain the surprisingly low slope of the Phillips curve. We show that the natural rate closely tracked the actual rate during the long recovery that began in 2009 and ended in 2020. We explain how the common finding of research in the Phillips-curve framework of low-often extremely low-response of inflation to unemployment could be the result of fairly close tracking of the natural rate and the actual rate in recoveries. Our interpretation of the data contrasts to that of most Phillips-curve studies, that conclude that inflation has little relation to unemployment. We suggest that the at Phillips curve is an illusion caused by assuming that the natural rate of unemployment has little or no movement during recoveries.",https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/working-papers/2023/33/,2023-33,11/1/2023,FED-SANFRANCISCO,11/15/2023
Partisan Traps,"Ethan Bueno de Mesquita, Wioletta Dziuda","The desire to stifle political competition may lead elected officials to eschew common-interest reforms and focus instead on zero-sum partisan conflict. By forgoing opportunities for common-interest reforms, incumbents may convince their constituents that such reforms are rarely feasible, so that policymaking is primarily about choosing partisan sides. Voters with such beliefs vote based on ideological alignment, rather than factors such as competence or honesty. This is electorally beneficial for incumbents, who are typically ideologically aligned with their constituents. We capture this logic in an infinite horizon model and characterize the resulting dynamics of politics and policymaking. Equilibrium exhibits partisan traps-voters are pessimistic about common-interest opportunities, and hence elect ideologically aligned incumbents, and incumbents respond by behaving in a purely partisan manner that shuts down voter learning. Partisan traps often occur in equilibrium even when common-interest reforms are in fact frequently feasible. The model shows how elite and mass polarization are intertwined, with politicians engaging in strategically polarized and polarizing behavior which leads to pessimistic beliefs among voters, who then vote in partisan fashion.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/partisan-traps/,2023-145,10-Nov-23,BFI,11/15/2023

Does the World Free Ride on US Pledges to Reduce Greenhouse Gas  Emissions? Evidence from the Paris Climate Agreement,"Trevor Houser, Kate Larsen, Michael Greenstone","The US is widely believed to play a pivotal role in the development of international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but do other countries free ride on US pledges? This paper provides what we believe is the first empirical evidence by proposing the US Climate Reciprocity Ratio (CRR); this summary statistic is the ratio of the rest of the world’s pledged reductions to the US’ pledged reductions through international climate negotiations. The analysis begins by quantifying countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Net Zero targets under the Paris Agreement by taking the difference between their pledges and leading “business as usual” projections of their emissions at the time of their pledges (e.g., from the International Energy Administration). Using these pledged reductions, there are two main findings: 1) pledged emissions reductions under the Paris Agreement, if successfully achieved, would reduce global net GHG emissions by 12% – 24% in 2030 and by 38% – 54% in 2050; and 2) the estimated CRR ranges from 2.5 to 10.8, with the upper end of the range applying to the middle of the century when the US’ share of global emissions has declined. Although pledges are not the same as reductions, these findings suggest that US climate policy can have indirect benefits by unlocking pledged reductions in other countries that benefit the US.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/does-the-world-free-ride-on-us-pledges-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-evidence-from-the-paris-climate-agreement/,2023-146-1,15-Nov-23,BFI,11/16/2023
Time Use and the Efficiency of Heterogeneous Markups,"Brian C. Albrecht, Tom Phelan, Nick Pretnar","What are the welfare implications of markup heterogeneity across firms? In standard monopolistic competition models, such heterogeneity implies inefficiency even in the presence of free entry. We enrich the standard model with heterogeneous firms so that preferences are non-separable in off-market time and market consumption and show that this changes the welfare implications of markup heterogeneity. In this context, homogeneity of markups is neither necessary nor sufficient for efficiency. The marginal cost of the marginal firm is weakly inefficiently high when off-market time and market consumption are complements and inefficiently low when they are substitutes, and the equilibrium allocation devotes weakly too few resources to firm creation. However, when off-market time and market consumption are perfect complements, markups are heterogeneous across firms and yet the equilibrium allocation is efficient.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2328-time-use-and-efficiency-of-heterogeneous-markups,23-28,11.16.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/16/2023
What drives core inflation? The role of supply shocks,"Marta Bańbura, Elena Bobeica, Catalina Martínez Hernández","We propose a framework to identify a rich set of structural drivers of inflation in order to understand the role of the multiple and concomitant sources of the post-pandemic inflation surge. We specify a medium-sized structural Bayesian VAR on a comprehensive set of variables for the euro area economy. We analyse in particular various types of supply shocks, some of which were not considered relevant before the pandemic, notably global supply chain shocks and gas price shocks. The residuals of the VAR are assumed to admit a factor structure and the shocks are identified via zero and sign restrictions on factor loadings. The framework can deal with ragged-edge data and extreme observations. Shocks linked to global supply chains and to gas prices have exhibited a much larger influence than in the past. Overall, supply shocks can explain the bulk of the post-pandemic inflation surge, also for core inflation. Being able to gauge the impact of such shocks is useful for policy making. We show that a counterfactual core inflation measure net of energy and global supply chain shocks has been more stable after the pandemic.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2875~e585ae652b.en.pdf?f85a8b326ab051060796d6b29cd8a9d1,2875,16-Nov-23,ECB,11/16/2023
The Optimal Supply of Central Bank Reserves under Uncertainty,"Gara Afonso, Gabriele La Spada, Thomas M. Mertens, John C.

We fully characterize the optimal supply of central bank reserves and associated market equilibrium. We find that the optimal supply of reserves under uncertainty is greater than that absent uncertainty. With a sufficient degree of uncertainty, it is optimal to supply a level of reserves that is abundant (on the flat portion of the demand curve) absent shocks. The optimal mean spread between the market interest rate and administered rates under uncertainty may be higher or lower than that absent uncertainty.

Inflation risk premia appear in the theory and cause inflation to deviate from its target on average. We re-estimate the model based on each day’s closing prices to capture high-frequency changes in the expected path of the economy. Our estimates show that financial markets reacted to the post-COVID surge in inflation with higher short-run inflation expectations, an increase in the inflation risk premium, and an increase in the long-run neutral real rate, 𝑟∗, while long-term inflation expectations remained well anchored.

Defusing leverage: liquidity management and labor contracts,Edoardo Maria Acabbi and Andrea Alati,"This study employs Italian administrative data to investigate how the use of permanent and fixed-term labor contracts influences the transmission of aggregate shocks to firms’ fundamentals. We explore how firms strategically manage their labor-induced operating leverage by adjusting the composition of contracts in their workforce. Our findings reveal two key insights. First, a higher labor share is associated with increased volatility in cash flows following unexpected real shocks, indicating the presence of operating leverage through labor costs. Second, firms with a greater proportion of temporary contracts exhibit lower variability in cash flows and profits. This smoothing effect is more pronounced in firms with a higher labor share attributed to the permanent workforce. We complement our analysis by examining the 2001 labor market reform that lifted restrictions on the creation of temporary contracts. Our results demonstrate that firms, following the staggered implementation of the reform, increased their utilization of temporary contracts while reducing average labor compensation. Furthermore, we find that, only among firms with an ex-ante more rigid labor cost structure and in more concentrated labor markets, the earlier transition to a more flexible workforce composition led to a sizable increase in profit margins and a decrease in the cross-sectional standard deviation of profits.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2023/defusing-leverage-liquidity-management-and-labor-contracts,1051,"Fri, 17 Nov 2",BOE,11/17/2023
Hidden exposure: measuring US supply chain reliance,"Richard Baldwin, Rebecca Freeman and Angelos Theodorakopoulos","Supply chain problems, previously relegated to specialized journals, now appear in G7 Leaders’ Communiqués. Our paper looks at three core elements of the problems: measurement of the links that expose supply chains to disruptions, the nature of the shocks that cause the disruptions, and the criteria for policy to mitigate the impact of disruptions. Utilizing global input-output data, we show that US exposure to foreign suppliers, and particularly to China, is ‘hidden’ in the sense that it is much larger than what conventional trade data suggest. However, at the macro level, exposure remains relatively modest, given that over 80% of US industrial inputs are sourced domestically. We argue that many recent shocks to supply chains have been systemic rather than idiosyncratic. Moreover, systemic shocks are likely to arise from climate change, geoeconomic tensions, and digital disruptions. Our principal conclusion is that concerns regarding supply chain disruptions, and policies to address them, should focus on individual products, rather than the whole manufacturing sector.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2023/hidden-exposure-measuring-us-supply-chain-reliance,1052,"Fri, 17 Nov 2",BOE,11/17/2023
US monetary policy spillovers to European banks,Alexander Jung,"The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy announcements have created massive spillovers to global financial markets. Based on daily data for the sample from 1999 to 2019, this study finds that the Fed’s monetary policy announcements created significant international spillovers to bond yields and stock prices of European banks and non-financial corporations (NFCs), while changes in uncertainty around the expected Fed policy path and Fed information effects constituted critical additional dimensions of these spillover effects. International spillovers to bond yields of banks and NFCs were similar, while stock prices of European banks responded somewhat stronger than those of NFCs. The significant spillovers from the Fed’s forward guidance to European bond yields show that central bank communication is very relevant for international transmission.

Using a nationally representative sample of over 3,500 participants, we conduct a randomized online survey experiment to examine how the willingness to use CBDC as a means of payment varies with the degree of privacy protection and information provision on the privacy benefits of using CBDC. We find that both factors significantly increase participants' willingness to use CBDC by up to 60% when purchasing privacy-sensitive products.",https://www.bis.org/publ/work1147.htm,1147,11/17/2023,BIS,11/17/2023
On par: A Money View of stablecoins," Iñaki Aldasoro, Perry Mehrling, Daniel H.

By analogizing on-chain with offshore, and developing an extended analogy of stablecoins with Eurodollars, we reveal the primitive character of the existing on-chain liquidity mechanism which supports the promise of par settlement by existing on-chain stablecoin models.

Central Bank Digital Currency and Bank Disintermediation in a Portfolio Choice Model,"Huifeng Chang, Federico Grinberg, Lucyna Gornicka, Marcello Miccoli, Brandon  Tan","Would the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) lead to lower deposits (disintermediation) and lending in the banking sector? This paper develops a model where households heterogeneous in wealth allocate between an illiquid asset and assets that can be used for payments: bank deposits, cash, and CBDC. CBDC is more efficient as a means of payment and has lower access cost than deposits. Deposits are offered by an imperfectly competitive banking sector which raises deposit interest rates after CBDC introduction to prevent substitution away from deposits to CBDC. We find that there are two opposing margins of impact on the level of aggregate deposits: (1) the intensive margin gain in deposits by richer households increasing their holdings of deposits because of higher interest rates, and (2) the extensive margin loss of deposits among poorer households who switch from deposits to the CBDC. The extensive margin gain in deposits is more likely to dominate (yielding a fall in total deposits) when the mass of poorer households is large and when it is relatively costly to access bank accounts. This tends to be the case in developing and emerging market economies. However, even when the extensive margin loss of deposits dominates and there is disintermediation, the impact on lending is quantitatively small if banks have access to other forms of funding, such as wholesale or central bank financing.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/18/Central-Bank-Digital-Currency-and-Bank-Disintermediation-in-a-Portfolio-Choice-Model-541607,WPIEA2023236,"Fri, 17 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/18/2023
Currencies of External Balance Sheets,"Cian Allen, Deepali Gautam, Luciana Juvenal","This paper assembles a comprehensive dataset of the currency composition of countries’ external balance sheets for 50 economies over the period 1990–2020. We document the following findings: (i) the US dollar and the euro still dominate global external balance sheets; (ii) there were striking changes in the currency composition across countries since the 1990s, with many emerging markets having moved from short to long positions in foreign currency, thus moving away from the so-called “original sin”; (iii) financial and tradeweighted exchange rates are weakly correlated, suggesting the commonly used trade indices do not adequately reflect the wealth effects of currency movements, and (iv) the large wealth transfers across countries during COVID-19 and the global financial crises increased global imbalances in the former, and reduced them in the latter.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/18/Currencies-of-External-Balance-Sheets-541610,WPIEA2023237,"Fri, 17 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/18/2023
Estimating Fiscal Multipliers Under Alternative Exchange Rate Regimes: The Case of Bolivia,"Tannous Kass-Hanna, Julien Reynaud, Chris Walker","Empirical (employing the Blanchard-Perotti framework) and modeling (using a country-specific DSGE model) approaches are used to estimate fiscal multipliers by policy instrument for Bolivia, to evaluate possible adjustments in a fiscal consolidation strategy. Multipliers are also estimated using alternative assumptions about the accompanying exchange rate regime and capital mobility, highlighting the importance of the policy mix in determining the impact of fiscal adjustments. The study exploits the DSGE modeling structure to assess this interaction of fiscal and monetary policy in a lower middle-income country under different exchange rate regimes. It finds that expenditure multipliers fall into the range of 1/3 to 2/3, with public investment multipliers slightly higher than government consumption multipliers over longer horizons, and multipliers generally higher under a peg than inflation targeting. Tax multipliers are shown to be about half of expenditure multipliers.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/18/Estimating-Fiscal-Multipliers-Under-Alternative-Exchange-Rate-Regimes-The-Case-of-Bolivia-541616,WPIEA2023240,"Fri, 17 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/18/2023
Is FinTech Eating the Bank's Lunch?,"Sami Ben Naceur, Bertrand Candelon, Selim A Elekdag, Drilona Emrullahu","This paper examines how the growing presence of FinTech firms affects the performance of traditional financial institutions. The findings point to a negative impact on profitability, primarily due to a reduction in interest income and a rise in operational costs. Although established financial institutions have tried to diversify their revenue streams, these efforts have proven inadequate to offset the losses associated with increased competition from FinTech firms. Our study also reveals that various FinTech business models, such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending and Balance Sheet lending, have varying effects on financial institutions. Cooperative banks experience more significant profit deterioration under both models, whereas (larger) commercial banks appear to benefit from partnerships with P2P platforms, as evidenced by an increase in non-interest income. Furthermore, the findings suggest that FinTech presence has a disproportionately larger adverse effect on banks in countries with more competitive, profitable, and developed financial systems. Interestingly, however, traditional financial institutions in countries with stronger regulatory frameworks appear to benefit from the expanding influence of FinTech firms.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/18/Is-FinTech-Eating-the-Bank-s-Lunch-540817,WPIEA2023239,"Fri, 17 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/18/2023

We shed light on these questions by exploring individual-level and nationally representative survey data for Uganda, a country in a region that pioneered mobile money in the world. We use the Propensity Score Matching method to robustly compare mobile money users and non-users across a range of indicators that capture individuals’ perceptions about cash, and the extent to which they remit, save, and borrow money. We present the first evidence that mobile money users, compared to non-users, are more likely to perceive cash as risky and less likely to prefer carrying large amounts of cash. We also confirm that mobile money users are more likely to receive and send remittances, save, and borrow.

Counties with elevated C-section rates consistently perform more C-sections across mothers at all levels of appropriateness for the procedure. These elevated rates of C-section in high C-section counties are associated with reduced maternal and infant morbidity. We also find that C-section decisions are less responsive to underlying risks for Black mothers relative to white mothers, suggesting potential welfare-reducing disparities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31871,31871,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
A Model of Behavioral Manipulation,"Daron Acemoglu, Ali Makhdoumi, Azarakhsh Malekian, Asuman Ozdaglar","We build a model of online behavioral manipulation driven by AI advances. A platform dynamically offers one of n products to a user who slowly learns product quality. User learning depends on a product’s “glossiness,’ which captures attributes that make products appear more attractive than they are. AI tools enable platforms to learn glossiness and engage in behavioral manipulation. We establish that AI benefits consumers when glossiness is short-lived. In contrast, when glossiness is long-lived, users suffer because of behavioral manipulation. Finally, as the number of products increases, the platform can intensify behavioral manipulation by presenting more low-quality, glossy products.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31872,31872,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023

We summarize the state of knowledge about the impacts of protected area policies, with a focus on deforestation and vegetation cover. We discuss critical issues around data and measurement, identify the most commonly-used empirical methods, and summarize empirical evidence across multiple regions of the world. In most cases, protection has had at most a modest impact on forest cover, with stronger effects in areas that face pressure of economic development. We then identify several open areas for research to advance our understanding of the effectiveness of protected area policies: the use of promising recent econometric advancements, shifting focus to direct measures of biodiversity, filling the knowledge gap on the effect of protected area policy in advanced economies, investigating the long-run impacts of protection, and understanding its equilibrium effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31873,31873,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Late Bloomers: The Aggregate Implications of Getting Education Later in Life,"Zsófia L. Bárány, Moshe Buchinsky, Pauline Corblet","It is generally agreed upon that most individuals who acquire a college degree do so in their early 20s. Despite this consensus, we show that in the US from the 1930 birth cohort onwards a large fraction – around 20% – of college graduates obtained their degree after age 30. We explore the implications of this phenomenon. First, we show that these so-called late bloomers have significantly contributed to the narrowing of gender and racial gaps in the college share, despite the general widening of the racial gap. Second, late bloomers are responsible for more than half of the increase in the aggregate college share from 1960 onwards. Finally, we show that the returns to having a college degree vary depending on the age at graduation. Ignoring the existence of late bloomers therefore leads to a significant underestimation of the returns to college education for those finishing college in their early 20s.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31874,31874,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023

International Trade Responses to Labor Market Regulations,Mathilde Muñoz,"This paper studies how differences in labor market regulations shape countries' comparative advantage in the cross-border provision of labor-intensive services, using administrative data in Europe for the last two decades. I exploit exogenous variation in labor taxes and minimum wages faced by exporting firms engaged in a large European trade program.  Firms from different countries compete to supply the same physical service in the same location but their employees are subject to different payroll taxes and minimum wages.  These rules varied across countries,  sectors, and over time.  Reduced-form country case-studies as well as model-implied gravity estimates show evidence of large trade responses to lower labor taxes and minimum wages, with an elasticity that is around one.  The Bolkestein directive, by exempting foreign firms from all labor regulations in the destination country,  would have doubled exports of physical services from Eastern European countries, rationalizing the wave of protests in high-wage countries that led to the withdrawal of the proposal.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31876,31876,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Combinatorial Discrete Choice: A Quantitative Model of Multinational Location Decision,"Costas Arkolakis, Fabian Eckert, Rowan Shi","We introduce a general quantifiable framework to study the location decisions of multinational firms. In the model, firms choose in which locations to pay the fixed costs of setting up production, taking into account potential complementarities among production locations. The firm’s location choice problem is combinatorial because the marginal value of an individual production location depends on its complete set of production sites. We develop a computational method to solve such problems and aggregate optimal decisions across heterogeneous firms. We use our calibrated model to study Brexit and the recent sanctions war with Russia. In both counterfactuals, changes in the location decisions of multinationals are driving real wage responses.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31877,31877,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023

Our starting point is the Vayanos and Vila (2009, 2021) model of the term structure of default-free bond yields, which we present in both discrete and continuous time. The key friction in the model is that the bond market is partially segmented from other financial markets: the prices of short-rate and bond supply risk are set by specialized bond arbitrageurs who must absorb shocks to the supply and demand for bonds from other “preferred-habitat” agents. We discuss extensions of this model in the context of default-free bonds and other asset classes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31879,31879,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
The Power of Proximity to Coworkers: Training for Tomorrow or Productivity Today?,"Natalia Emanuel, Emma Harrington, Amanda Pallais","Amidst the rise of remote work, we ask: what are the effects of proximity to coworkers? We find being near coworkers has tradeoffs: proximity increases long-run human capital development at the expense of short-term output. We study software engineers at a Fortune 500 firm, whose main campus has two buildings several blocks apart. When offices were open, engineers working in the same building as all their teammates received 22 percent more online feedback than engineers with distant teammates. After offices closed for COVID-19, this advantage largely disappears. Yet sitting together reduces engineers' programming output, particularly for senior engineers. The tradeoffs from proximity are more acute for women, who both do more mentoring and receive more mentorship when near their coworkers. Proximity impacts career trajectories, dampening short-run pay raises but boosting them in the long run. These results can help to explain national trends: workers in their twenties who often need mentorship and workers over forty who often provide mentorship are more likely to return to the office. However, even if most mentors and mentees go into the office, remote work may reduce interaction:  pre-COVID, having just one distant teammate reduced feedback among co-located workers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31880,31880,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Long-term Care in the United States,"Jonathan Gruber, Kathleen M.

In this chapter, we review the delivery and financing of long-term care in the U.S. We show that the resources of most elderly in the U.S. are insufficient to finance these ongoing long-term care needs and the public sector finances the majority of long-term care spending.  At the same time, informal care plays a critical role, with the elderly at every age and every disability level receiving informal care more frequently than formal care.  Indeed, when properly valued, informal care accounts for more than one-third of the nearly 2 percent of U.S. GDP devoted to long-term care.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31881,31881,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Long-term Care Around the World,"Jonathan Gruber, Kathleen M. McGarry, Charles Hanzel","The developed world is in the midst of an enormous demographic transition, with life expectancy increasing and fertility falling, leading to a rapid aging of the population.  This trend has critical implications for long-term care around the world.  This paper serves as the introduction to a volume that brings together experts from ten countries to compare long term care systems.  We find a number of important similarities: only a minority of those elderly receiving assistance rely solely on formal care (i.e. care in an institution or through paid home care) while the majority of care is provided informally by family or other unpaid caregivers; without public support, the cost of long-term care would be beyond the financial means of a large fraction of the elderly in each country, particularly for the oldest and most disabled; and the public sector bears the majority of the costs of formal long-term care in every country.  There are, however, important differences across countries, particularly in the extent to which formal care is delivered in institutions or at home, and in the division between the use of formal and informal care.  Given the importance of informal care across all countries studied, we conclude that any estimate of the social costs of long-term care must account for the implicit costs of informal care.  In undertaking such an evaluation of informal care, we find that it comprises at least one-third of all long-term care spending for all countries studied, with an average portion of nearly fifty percent.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31882,31882,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Ten Facts about Son Preference in India,Seema Jayachandran,"This article discusses son preference in India, including both greater investment in sons and the fertility preference for sons. Regarding differential investment, I focus on child health and show that gender gaps in inputs and outcomes have narrowed in recent years. Nonetheless, girls remain disadvantaged in important ways, and making health services free is unlikely to be enough to close these remaining gaps. In addition to gender gaps, there are also stark health gaps between eldest sons, whom parents favor, and other sons. Fertility preferences likewise center on eldest sons. The desire to have at least one son — who can fill that eldest son role in the family — drives the skewed sex ratio, and this preference shows little sign of abating. In fact, the downward trend in family size is exacerbating how the desire for a son translates into sex-selection. Families’ quest for a son also imposes collateral damage on sisters’ health. The policy challenge, particularly around reducing the desire for sons, is large. Empowering women is not a panacea, and offering financial incentives to have daughters risks further concentrating girls in poorer families. While we do not know which policies will erase the disadvantages girls face, some that might advance this goal are public pensions as an alternative to old-age support from sons, increased delivery of health services through schools, and norm-change interventions that aim to increase the intrinsic value that Indian families place on girls.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31883,31883,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Insurance Coverage and Provision of Opioid Treatment: Evidence from Medicare,"Denis Agniel, Jonathan H. Cantor, Johanna Catherine Maclean, Kosali I.

Methadone, one of just three medications approved by the Food & Drug Administration for opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment, was not covered by Medicare — the primary insurer of older Americans — for OUD until 2020. We study the response of opioid treatment programs (OTPs), the only healthcare providers that can dispense methadone for OUD in the U.S., to this landmark policy change using administrative data and a difference—in—differences framework. We examine two outcomes: provider acceptance of Medicare payment and the number of treatment episodes, before and after the policy change, in OTPs relative to other substance use disorder treatment facilities. Our findings show a surge in Medicare acceptance by OTPs and an increase in the number of treatment episodes post−policy. We also test for potential spillovers of the Medicare policy change to other insurance markets, provision of charity care, and service offerings.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31884,31884,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023

Fentanyl is smuggled from abroad, with little evidence on how this happens. We show that a substantial amount of fentanyl smuggling occurs via legal trade flows, with a positive relationship between state-level imports and drug overdoses that accounts for 15,000-20,000 deaths per year. This relationship is not explained by geographic differences in ""deaths of despair,'' general demand for opioids, or job losses from import competition.

Pandemic-Era Inflation Drivers and Global Spillovers,"Julian di Giovanni, Ṣebnem Kalemli-Özcan, Alvaro Silva, Muhammed A. Yildirim","We estimate a multi-country multi-sector New Keynesian model to quantify the drivers of domestic inflation during 2020–2023 in several countries, including the United States. The model matches observed inflation together with sector-level prices and wages. We further measure the relative importance of different types of shocks on inflation across countries over time. The key mechanism, the international transmission of demand, supply and energy shocks through global linkages helps us to match the behavior of the USD/Euro exchange rate. The quantification exercise yields four key findings. First, negative supply shocks to factors of production, labor and intermediate inputs, initially sparked inflation in 2020–2021. Global supply chains and complementarities in production played an amplification role in this initial phase. Second, positive aggregate demand shocks, due to stimulative policies, widened demand-supply imbalances, amplifying inflation further during 2021–2022. Third, the reallocation of consumption between goods and service sectors, a relative sector-level demand shock, played a role in transmitting these imbalances across countries through the global trade and production network. Fourth, global energy shocks have differential impacts on the US relative to other countries’ inflation rates. Further, complementarities between energy and other inputs to production play a particularly important role in the quantitative impact of these shocks on inflation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31887,31887,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Heterogeneous and Racialized Impacts of State Incarceration Policies on Birth Outcomes in the U.S.,"Courtney Boen, Elizabeth Bair, Hedwig Lee, Atheendar Venkataramani","While state incarceration policies have received much attention in research on the causes of mass incarceration in the U.S., their roles in shaping population health and health disparities remain largely unknown. We examine the impacts of two signature state incarceration policies adopted during the “tough on crime” era of the 1990s—three strikes and truth in sentencing—on Black and White birth outcomes. Using a difference-in-differences event study research design that models the dynamic impacts of these policies over time, we find that these policies had opposing effects on birth outcomes. We find that birth weight outcomes—including mean birth weight and low birth weight—for Black infants worsened markedly in the year three strikes policies were adopted. By contrast, birth outcomes for Black and White infants gradually improved after truth in sentencing policies were adopted. The discordant findings point to distinct, countervailing mechanisms by which sentencing policies can affect population health. We provide suggestive evidence that three strikes policies adversely impacted Black birth outcomes through affective mechanisms, by inducing highly racialized, stigmatizing public discourse around the time of policy adoption, while truth in sentencing likely impacted birth outcomes via material mechanisms, namely gradually reductions in community incarceration and crime rates. Altogether, these findings point to the need to further interrogate state criminal legal system policies for their impacts on population health, considering whether, how, and for whom these policies result in health impacts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31888,31888,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Long-term Care in Denmark,"Mette Gørtz, Bent Jesper Christensen, Nabanita Datta Gupta","The population is aging in Denmark, as in many other countries, due to increasing life expectancy and a low total fertility rate. This potentially puts the Danish welfare state under pressure. This paper discusses the demographic and socioeconomic situation of the elderly in Denmark, focusing on the health status and financial situation of the elderly, and the provision of long-term care (LTC). We rely on a combination of survey data, mainly from the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), and high-quality register data covering the entire Danish population. We find that a large fraction of the elderly is in good health, but that those in the older age group, 85+, face considerably more functional limitations in daily living. One in three of the elderly receives some form of long-term care, and more than half the 85+ group. The paper further identifies a number of current challenges regarding organization of the long-term care sector, including recruitment of personnel for health care and LTC. Finally, the paper sheds light on the extent of informal care provided by family and friends. While informal care is offered voluntarily and is generally unpaid, it represents a substantial opportunity cost to society.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31889,31889,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023

Federal Reserve Structure and the Production of Monetary Policy Ideas,"Michael D. Bordo, Edward S. Prescott","We evaluate the decentralized structure of the Federal Reserve System as a mechanism for generating and processing new ideas on monetary policy over the 1960 - 2000 period. We document the introduction of monetarism, rational expectations, credibility, transparency, and other monetary policy ideas by Reserve Banks into the Federal Reserve System. We argue that the Reserve Banks were willing to support and develop new ideas due to internal reforms to the FOMC that Chairman William McChesney Martin implemented in the 1950s and the increased ties with academia that developed in this period. Furthermore, the Reserve Banks were able to succeed at this because of their private-public governance structure. We illustrate this with a time-consistency model in which a decentralized organization is better at producing new ideas than a centralized one. We argue that this role of the Reserve Banks is an important benefit of the Federal Reserve’s decentralized structure by allowing for more competition in formulating ideas and by reducing groupthink.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2329-frs-structure-and-monetary-policy-idea-production,23-29,11.20.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/21/2023
Retail Central Bank Digital Currencies: Implications for Banking and Financial Stability,"Sebastian Infante, Kyungmin Kim, Anna Orlik, André F. Silva, Robert J. Tetlow","This paper reviews the literature examining how the introduction of a retail CBDC would affect the banking sector and financial stability. A CBDC has the potential to improve welfare by reducing financial frictions, countering market power in deposit markets and enhancing the payment system. However, a CBDC also entails noteworthy risks, including the possibility of bank disintermediation and associated contraction in bank credit, as well as potential adverse effects on financial stability. The recycling of the new CBDC liability through asset purchases or lending by the central bank plays an important role in determining the economic consequences of the introduction of a CBDC. A CBDC also raises important questions regarding the footprint of central banks in the financial system. Ultimately, the effects of a CBDC depend critically on its design features, of which remuneration is the one discussed most often in the literature.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/retail-central-bank-digital-currencies-implications-for-banking-and-financial-stability.htm,2023-072,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/21/2023
Borrowing and Spending in the Money: Debt Substitution and the Cash-out Refinance Channel of Monetary Policy,"Elliot Anenberg, Tess Scharlemann, Eileen van Straelen","We show that the strong negative effect of higher mortgage rates on cash-out refinancing reflects substitution into other borrowing products, not large changes in total new household borrowing. We exploit an exogenous increase in long-term rates to show that, in the cross-section of outstanding mortgage rates, changes in cash-out and alternative borrowing are offsetting. Additionally, we instrument using monetary policy surprises to show that, over the period from 2006-2021, changes in cash-out refinancing are offset by alternative borrowing. Our results suggest that debt substitution substantially weakens the cash-out refinance channel of monetary policy and reduces its path-dependence.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/borrowing-and-spending-in-the-money.htm,2023-073,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/21/2023
Predictive Density Combination Using a Tree-Based Synthesis Function,"Tony Chernis, Niko Hauzenberger, Florian Huber, Gary Koop, James Mitchell","Bayesian predictive synthesis (BPS) provides a method for combining multiple predictive distributions based on agent/expert opinion analysis theory and encompasses a range of existing density forecast pooling methods. The key ingredient in BPS is a “synthesis” function. This is typically specified parametrically as a dynamic linear regression. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric treatment of the synthesis function using regression trees. We show the advantages of our tree-based approach in two macroeconomic forecasting applications. The first uses density forecasts for GDP growth from the euro area’s Survey of Professional Forecasters. The second combines density forecasts of US inflation produced by many regression models involving different predictors. Both applications demonstrate the benefits – in terms of improved forecast accuracy and interpretability – of modeling the synthesis function nonparametrically.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2330-predictive-density-combination,23-30,11.21.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/21/2023
Informal Work and Official Employment Statistics: What’s Missing?,Anat Bracha and Mary A. Burke,"Using eight consecutive waves of the Survey of Informal Work Participation (SIWP) spanning 2015 through 2022, we investigate informal “gig” work participation in the United States—broadly defined to include online and offline activities—and its implications for the measurement of employment. Our results suggest that employment rates among US household heads were consistently understated in the Current Population Survey (CPS). Under conservative estimates, we find that the employment-to-population ratio would have been 0.25 to 1.1 percentage points higher over the 2015–2022 period and as much as 5.1 percentage points higher under more generous estimates. Along the intensive margin, we find evidence that a significant number of informal work hours are missing from official employment surveys, partly because employed individuals do not fully report their informal hours.  Comparing informal workers who are classified as employed by the CPS with those who are arguably misclassified as nonemployed, we find that the latter are, on average, older, less educated, and less likely to cite income as a motivation for gig work, and an elevated share are disabled. The data also indicate that certain types of income-earning activities, such as renting and selling, are less likely to be perceived as “work.”  These results suggest ways to improve official surveys to better capture those employed in gig work and obtain a fuller picture of the labor market.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/informal-work-and-official-employment-statistics-whats-missing,23-15,21-Nov-23,FED-BOSTON,11/21/2023
Who bears the costs of inflation? Euro area households and the 2021–2022 shock,"Filippo Pallotti, Gonzalo Paz-Pardo, Jiri Slacalek, Oreste Tristani, Giovanni L. Violante","We measure the heterogeneous welfare effects of the recent inflation surge across households in the Euro Area. A simple framework illustrating the numerous channels of the transmission mechanism of surprise inflation to household welfare guides our empirical exercise. By combining micro data and aggregate time series, we conclude that: (i) country-level average welfare costs –expressed as a share of 2021–22 income– were larger than a typical recession, and heterogeneous, e.g., 3% in France and 8% in Italy; (ii) this inflation episode resembles an age-dependent tax, with the elderly losing up to 20%, and roughly half of the 25–44 year-old winning; (iii) losses were quite uniform across consumption quantiles because rigid rents served as a hedge for the poor; (iv) nominal net positions are the key driver of heterogeneity across-households; (v) the rise in energy prices generated vast variation in individual-level inflation rates, but unconventional fiscal policies were critical in shielding the most vulnerable households.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2877~698cc193b0.en.pdf?a2f23a2307e8083a3fa1beadb61ad281,2877,23-Nov-23,ECB,11/21/2023
Do debt investors care about ESG ratings?,"Kornelia Fabisik, Michael Ryf, Larissa Schäfer, Sascha Steffen","We study the effect of changes in firms’ ESG ratings on the cost of debt of U.S. firms using a methodology change of an ESG rating provider. We find that loan spreads of downgraded ESG-rated firms in the secondary corporate loan market increase by about 10% compared to non-downgraded ESG-rated firms after the methodology change. The effect of ESG rating downgrades is not driven by the increase in the fundamental default risk of firms but rather by the premium charged by investors above the spread for default risk. The effect is stronger for firms that are more financially constrained, firms that are more exposed to ESG and, particularly, climate risk concerns as well as firms that are more held by climate-concerned lenders. We show that also loan spreads of private (unrated) firms in industries affected by ESG rating downgrades increase after the methodology change.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2878~084d57bc4d.en.pdf?85c5710707360da0be01282b5019dfac,2878,24-Nov-23,ECB,11/24/2023
Moderation or indulgence? Effects of bank distribution restrictions during stress,"Jonathan Acosta-Smith, Jozef Barunik, Eddie Gerba and Petros Katsoulis","At the onset of the Covid‑19 crisis, several regulatory authorities issued a recommendation or request to banks to restrict their dividend and share buyback distributions. The purpose of this action was to increase banks’ resilience by not distributing retained earnings, and help them support the real economy given their unique role in doing so. These restrictions reflected the singular circumstances brought by Covid‑19. We evaluate the impact of these restrictions on banks’ resilience, lending and investors’ required rate of return. First, using a difference‑in‑differences analysis on an international sample of European banks, we find that restricted banks increased their available Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital and resilience in every quarter while the restrictions were fully in place, before gradually reducing it once they were partly lifted. Second, using a data set on the universe of UK small and medium‑sized enterprise (SME) loans issued by nine UK banking groups, we find that restricted banks increased their lending volumes on smaller non‑government guaranteed loans throughout the implementation period. Third, using the international sample of European banks, we find that the restrictions increased shareholders’ required rate of return throughout the implementation period, with the impact on the required rate of return on capital partially offset by lower debtholders’ required rate of return. The results indicate that distribution restrictions can be an effective crisis tool to increase banks’ resilience and lending capacity.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2023/moderation-or-indulgence-effects-of-bank-distribution-restrictions-during-stress,1053,"Fri, 24 Nov 2023",BOE,11/24/2023
"Uncovered interest rate, overshooting, and predictability reversal puzzles in an emerging economy",Rehim Kilic,"By using realized and survey-based expected exchange rate data, the paper presents five key findings regarding the Uncovered Interest rate Parity (UIP) and related puzzles in an Emerging Market (EM). First, Fama regressions, when not accounting for shifts in the UIP relationship, yield slopes that are statistically identical to one, irrespective of whether survey-based expected exchange rates or realized exchange rates are used. Second, caution is necessary however, as our analysis identifies three distinct sub-periods within each exchange rate measure, each exhibiting varying levels of puzzling behavior. Third, under realized exchange rates, expectation errors can introduce both downward and upward biases or no bias at all, depending on the sub-period. On the other hand, currency risk premiums consistently lead to a downward bias. Under expected exchange rates, currency risk premiums continue to exert a downward bias at varying degrees across sub-periods. Fourth, responses to interest rate differential shocks by expectation errors are pivotal in inducing both downward and upward biases or removing biases altogether when utilizing realized exchange rate data. Fifth, evidence concerning overshooting and reversal puzzles, as well as their link to the UIP puzzle, varies depending on the specific sub-period and the choice of exchange rate measurement, making it more intricate than the previous literature has documented.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/uncovered-interest-rate-overshooting-and-predictability-reversal-puzzles-in-an-emerging-economy.htm,2023-074,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/25/2023
Supply Chain Constraints and Inflation,"Diego Comin, Robert Johnson, Callum Jones","We develop a multisector, open economy, New Keynesian framework to evaluate how potentially binding capacity constraints, and shocks to them, shape inflation. We show that binding constraints for domestic and foreign producers shift domestic and import price Phillips Curves up, similar to reduced-form markup shocks. Further, data on prices and quantities together identify whether constraints bind due to increased demand or reductions in capacity. Applying the model to interpret recent US data, we find that binding constraints explain half of the increase in inflation during 2021-2022. In particular, tight capacity served to amplify the impact of loose monetary policy in 2021, fueling the inflation takeoff.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/supply-chain-constraints-and-inflation.htm,2023-075,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/25/2023
Stakeholders’ Aversion to Inequality and Bank Lending to Minorities,Matteo Crosignani and Hanh Le,"We find that banks differ in their propensity to lend to minorities based on their stakeholders’ aversion to inequality. Using mortgage application data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, we document a large and persistent cross-sectional variation in banks’ propensity to lend to minorities. Inequality-averse banks have a higher propensity to lend to borrowers in high-minority areas and, within census tracts, to non-white borrowers compared to other banks. This higher propensity (i) is not explained by selection of applicants, (ii) allows these banks to retain and attract their inequality-averse stakeholders, and (iii) does not predict worse ex-post loan performance.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1079.html,1079,23-Nov,FED-NEWYORK,11/25/2023
Pandemic-Era Inflation Drivers and Global Spillovers,"Julian di Giovanni, Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan, Alvaro Silva, and Muhammed A.  Yıldırım","We estimate a multi-country, multi-sector New Keynesian model to quantify the drivers of domestic inflation during 2020–23 in several countries, including the United States. The model matches observed inflation together with sector-level prices and wages. We further measure the relative importance of different types of shocks on inflation across countries over time. The key mechanism, the international transmission of demand, supply and energy shocks through global linkages helps us to match the behavior of the USD/EUR exchange rate. The quantification exercise yields four key findings. First, negative supply shocks to factors of production, labor and intermediate inputs, initially sparked inflation in 2020-21. Global supply chains and complementarities in production played an amplification role in this initial phase. Second, positive aggregate demand shocks, due to stimulative policies, widened demand-supply imbalances, amplifying inflation further during 2021-22. Third, the reallocation of consumption between goods and service sectors, a relative sector-level demand shock, played a role in transmitting these imbalances across countries through the global trade and production network. Fourth, global energy shocks have differential impacts on the U.S. relative to other countries’ inflation rates. Further, complementarities between energy and other inputs to production play a particularly important role in the quantitative impact of these shocks on inflation.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1080.html,1080,23-Nov,FED-NEWYORK,11/25/2023
Fed Transparency and Policy Expectation Errors: A Text Analysis Approach,"Eric Fischer, Rebecca McCaughrin, Saketh Prazad, and Mark Vandergon","This paper seeks to estimate the extent to which market-implied policy expectations could be improved with further information disclosure from the FOMC. Using text analysis methods based on large language models, we show that if FOMC meeting materials with five-year lagged release dates—like meeting transcripts and Tealbooks—were accessible to the public in real time, market policy expectations could substantially improve forecasting accuracy. Most of this improvement occurs during easing cycles. For instance, at the six-month forecasting horizon, the market could have predicted as much as 125 basis points of additional easing during the 2001 and 2008 recessions, equivalent to a 40-50 percent reduction in mean squared error. This potential forecasting improvement appears to be related to incomplete information about the Fed’s reaction function, particularly with respect to financial stability concerns in 2008. In contrast, having enhanced access to meeting materials would not have improved the market’s policy rate forecasting during tightening cycles.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1081.html,1081,23-Nov,FED-NEWYORK,11/25/2023

Mitigating Climate Change at the Firm Level: Mind the Laggards,"Damien Capelle, Divya Kirti, Nicola Pierri, German Villegas Bauer","Using self-reported data on emissions for a global sample of 4,000 large, listed firms, we document large heterogeneity in environmental performance within the same industry and country. Laggards— firms with high emissions relative to the scale of their operations—are larger, operate older physical capital stocks, are less knowledge intensive and productive, and adopt worse management practices. To rationalize these findings, we build a novel general equilibrium heterogeneous-firm model in which firms choose capital vintages and R&D expenditure and hence emissions. The model matches the full empirical distribution of firmlevel heterogeneity among other moments. Our counter-factual analysis shows that this heterogeneity matters for assessing the macroeconomic costs of mitigation policies, the channels through which policies act, and their distributional effects.

A voting premium emerges when a minority blockholder tries to influence the composition of the shareholder base by accumulating votes and buying shares from dissenting shareholders. Empirical measures of the voting premium do not reflect the value of voting rights or voting power. A negative voting premium results from free-riding by dispersed shareholders on the blockholder’s trades. Conflicts between dispersed shareholders and the blockholder endogenously increase the liquidity of voting shares, but do not necessarily increase the voting premium.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31892,31892,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
What to do when you can't use '1.96' Confidence Intervals for IV,"David S. Lee, Justin McCrary, Marcelo J. Moreira, Jack R. Porter, Luther Yap","To address the well-established large-sample invalidity of the +/-1.96 critical values for the t-ratio in the single variable just-identified IV model, applied research typically qualifies the inference based on the first-stage-F (Staiger and Stock (1997) and Stock and Yogo (2005)). We fully extend this F-based approach to its logical conclusion by presenting new critical values for the t-ratio to additionally accommodate values of F that do not meet existing thresholds needed for validity. These new t-ratio critical values simultaneously fix the main problem of over-rejection (invalidity) and the under-appreciated possibility of under-rejection (conservativeness) that can occur when relying solely on the usual 1.96 critical value. We show that the corresponding new confidence intervals are generally expected to be substantially shorter than competing “robust to weak instrument” intervals, including those from the recommended benchmark of Anderson and Rubin (1949) (AR). In a sample of 89 specifications from 10 recent empirical studies drawn from five general interest journals, the new “VtF” intervals are shorter than AR intervals 100 percent of the time, and even more likely to produce statistically significant results than the usual +/-1.96 procedure.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31893,31893,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
How Do Households Respond to Income Shocks?,"Dirk Krueger, Egor Malkov, Fabrizio Perri","We use panel data from the Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth from 1991 to 2016 to document empirically what components of the household budget constraint change in response to shocks to household labor income, both over shorter and over longer horizons. We show that shocks to labor income are associated with negligible changes in transfers and non-labor income components, modest changes in consumption expenditures, and large changes in wealth. We then split the sample in households which do not own business or real estate wealth, and households who do. For the first group, we find that consumption responses are more substantial (and increasing with the horizon of the income shock) and wealth responses are much smaller. We show that, for this group, a version of the standard PIH framework that allows for partial insurance against even permanent income shocks can explain well the consumption and wealth responses, both at short and long horizons. For the second group the standard framework cannot explain the large changes in wealth associated with income shocks. We conclude that models which include shocks to the value of household wealth are necessary to fully evaluate the sources and the consequences of household resource risk.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31894,31894,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
The Impact of Commercial Real Estate Regulations on U.S. Output,"Fil Babalievsky, Kyle F. Herkenhoff, Lee E. Ohanian, Edward C. Prescott","Commercial real estate accounts for roughly 20% of the U.S. fixed asset stock, and commercial land use is highly regulated. However, little is known about the quantitative impact of these regulations on economic activity or consumer welfare. This paper develops a spatial general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy that includes commercial real estate regulations and congestion effects, the latter of which provide a rationale for such regulations. The model is tailored to exploit the near-universe of CoreLogic's commercial, parcel-level, property tax records to construct a quantitative index of commercial real estate regulations for nearly every commercial property. We use the model to evaluate the positive and normative impacts of commercial land use deregulations. Moderately relaxing commercial regulations across all U.S. cities yields large allocative efficiency effects, with output gains of about 3 percent to 6 percent and welfare gains of about 3 percent to 9 percent of lifetime consumption. We also find significant positive and normative gains from deregulation with 40 percent of the labor force working remotely.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31895,31895,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023

Learning by Investing: Entrepreneurial Spillovers from Venture Capital,"Josh Lerner, Jinlin Li, Tong Liu","This paper studies how investing in venture capital (VC) affects the entrepreneurial outcomes of individual limited partners (LPs). Using comprehensive administrative data on entrepreneurial activities and VC fundraising and investments in China, we first document that individual LPs, on average, contribute about 50% of the capital of each fund in which they participate, and over 50% of them are entrepreneurs. We then exploit an identification strategy by comparing the entrepreneurial outcomes of individual LPs in funds that eventually launched with those in funds that failed to launch. The fraction of committed capital from corporate LPs in industries that subsequently encounter poor returns is used as an instrument for funds’ launch failures. We find that after investing in a successfully launched VC fund, individual LPs create significantly more ventures than do LPs in funds which failed to launch. These new ventures tend to be high-tech firms and file more patents than do the LPs’ prior ventures.

The Effect of Public Science on Corporate R&D,"Ashish Arora, Sharon Belenzon, Larisa C.

We identify the relationships through firm-specific exposure to changes in federal agency R\&D budgets that are driven by the political composition of congressional appropriations subcommittees. Our results indicate that R&D by established firms, which account for more than three-quarters of business R&D, is affected by scientific knowledge produced by universities only when the latter is embodied in inventions or PhD scientists. Human capital trained by universities fosters innovation in firms. However, inventions from universities and public research institutes substitute for corporate inventions and reduce the demand for internal research by corporations, perhaps reflecting downstream competition from startups that commercialize university inventions. Moreover, abstract knowledge advances per se elicit little or no response.

Evaluating Tax Harmonization,James R. Hines Jr.,"Tax harmonization entails a uniform rate that may not suit all governments.  Harmonization can advance collective governmental objectives only if the standard deviation of tax rates is less than the average downward effect of tax competition on rates.  Since an efficient harmonized tax rate undoes the effect of competition, an efficient rate equals or exceeds the sum of the observed average tax rate and the standard deviation of rates.  In 2020, the mean world corporate tax rate was 25.9%, and the standard deviation 4.5%, so if there is an efficient harmonized world tax rate, it must be 30.4% or higher.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31900,31900,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
The High Frequency Effects of Dollar Swap Lines,"Rohan Kekre, Moritz Lenel","We study the effects of dollar swap lines using high frequency responses in asset prices around policy announcements.  News about expanded dollar swap lines causes a reduction in liquidity premia, compression of deviations from covered interest parity (CIP), and depreciation of the dollar.  Equity prices rise and the VIX falls, while the response of long-term government bond prices is mixed.  The cross-section of high frequency responses implies that swap lines affect the dollar factor or the price of risk.

Optimal Subsidies for Green Hydrogen Production,"Harrison Fell, Stephen P. Holland, Andrew J. Yates","Green hydrogen may decarbonize sectors which are difficult to electrify, and the recent Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides tax credits to encourage hydrogen production.   We analyze a model in which hydrogen produced using electricity replaces natural gas. The electricity may be procured from dedicated renewables or from the grid with and without offsetting.  In the absence of Pigouvian taxation, optimal hydrogen subsidies are positive if the unpriced externality from avoided natural gas is larger than the unpriced externality from electricity.    With optimally differentiated subsidies, offsetting increases welfare.  With undifferentiated subsidies, offsetting can decrease welfare, unless it is restricted to regions with higher unpriced electricity externalities.  Short-run parameterization shows that the IRA's subsidy of $3/kg-H2 is rationalized:  i) by hydrogen production from dedicated renewables if the social cost of carbon (SCC) is $500 or ii) by hydrogen production from the (relatively clean) grid in California with renewables offsetting (relatively dirty) electricity in the non-RGGI East if the SCC is $185. Allowing offsetting of production in California with renewables in any region does not reduce welfare, but the reverse does not hold.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31902,31902,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023

Sequential Search for Corporate Bonds,"Mahyar Kargar, Benjamin Lester, Sébastien Plante, Pierre-Olivier Weill","In over-the-counter (OTC) markets, customers search for counterparties. Little is known about this process, however, because existing data is comprised of transaction records, which are only informative about the end of a successful search. Leveraging data from the leading trading platform for corporate bonds, we offer evidence about the search process: we analyze customers’ repeated attempts to trade (successful and unsuccessful). We estimate that it takes two to three days to complete a transaction after an unsuccessful attempt, with substantial variation depending on trade and customer characteristics. Our analysis offers insights into the sources of trading delays in OTC markets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31904,31904,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
New Views Of Structural Transformation: Insights From Recent Literature,"Douglas Gollin, Joseph P. Kaboski","This paper describes an emerging literature in economics that aims to merge macro issues of structural change and growth with micro data and analysis. This literature focuses on a set of related patterns of change that accompany the processes of growth and development. Traditionally, the focus has been on industrialization – and more broadly the reallocation of employment and economic activity from agriculture to manufacturing and services. The new literature considers a broader set of transformations: from rural to urban, from home to market (and from market to home), from informal to formal, and from self-employment to wage work. Drawing on new data sources, including micro data and administrative records, the literature tries to understand the complex interactions of a broad set of market failures, policy distortions, and impediments to the growth process. In broadening the understanding of structural transformation – to encompass processes beyond industrialization – this literature opens the door to a richer understanding of the processes of growth and a wider set of potential levers for policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31905,31905,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
Schooling and Intergenerational Mobility: Consequences of Expanding Higher Education Institutions,"Noemí Katzkowicz, Victor Lavy, Martina Querejeta, Tatiana Rosá","Poor post-secondary education infrastructure and opportunities partly explain the low higher education rates in developing countries. This paper estimates the effect of a program that improved post-secondary education infrastructure by building many university campuses across Uruguay. Leveraging temporal and geographic variation in program implementation, we use a two-way fixed effect design and comprehensive administrative records to assess the program’s causal impact. By lowering the distance to a university campus, the program successfully increased university enrollment, particularly of less privileged students who are the first in their families to attend a university. The program impacted students from localities up to 30 kilometers from the new campus, reducing spatial inequality. Importantly, this expansion did not lower university completion rates. Furthermore, the program increased high school attendance and completion rates and the proportion of educated workers in the affected localities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31906,31906,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
Risk-On Risk-Off: A Multifaceted Approach to Measuring Global Investor Risk Aversion,"Anusha Chari, Karlye Dilts Stedman, Christian Lundblad","This paper defines risk-on risk-off (RORO), an elusive terminology in pervasive use, as the variation in global investor risk aversion. Our high-frequency RORO index captures time-varying investor risk appetite across multiple dimensions: advanced economy credit risk, equity market volatility, funding conditions, and currency dynamics. The index exhibits risk-off skewness and pronounced fat tails, suggesting its amplifying potential for extreme, destabilizing events. Compared with the conventional VIX measure, the RORO index reflects the multifaceted nature of risk, underscoring the diverse provenance of investor risk sentiment. Practical applications of the RORO index highlight its significance for international portfolio reallocation and return predictability.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31907,31907,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
Cost-Sharing in Medical Care Can Increase Adult Mortality: Evidence from Colombia,"Giancarlo Buitrago, Javier Amaya-Nieto, Grant Miller, Marcos Vera-Hernández","There is substantial evidence that cost-sharing in medical care constrains total health spending.  However, there is relatively little (and unclear) evidence on its health effects, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This paper re-evaluates the link between outpatient cost-sharing and health, studying Colombia’s entire formal sector workforce observed monthly between 2011 and 2018 with individual-level health care utilization records linked to payroll data and vital statistics. Because Colombia’s national health system imposes discrete breaks in outpatient cost-sharing requirements across the earnings distribution, we estimate a dynamic regression discontinuity model, finding that greater outpatient cost-sharing initially reduces use of outpatient care (including consultations and drugs), resulting in fewer diagnoses of common chronic diseases – and over time, increases the prevalence and severity of chronic diseases as well as use of inpatient care. Ultimately, greater outpatient cost-sharing measurably increases mortality, raising 8-year mortality by 4 deaths per 10,000 individuals. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show a relationship between cost-sharing and adult mortality risk in a low- or middle-income country, a relationship important to incorporate into social welfare analyses of cost-sharing policies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31908,31908,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
Contingent Credit Under Stress,"Viral V. Acharya, Maximilian Jager, Sascha Steffen","Over the past two decades, banks have increasingly focused on offering contingent credit in the form of credit lines as a primary means of corporate borrowing. We review the existing body of research regarding the rationales for banks’ provision of liquidity insurance in the form of credit lines, their significance in managing corporate liquidity, and the reasons and circumstances under which firms opt to utilize them. We emphasize that the options for firms to both draw down and repay credit lines are put options issued by banks, which are exercised by firms in a correlated manner during periods of widespread stress, with adverse affects on bank intermediation thereafter. We discuss the bank capital and the bank funding channels that can drive these effects, contrasting their roles during the Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 outbreak. We conclude by discussing the increasing extension of bank credit lines to non-bank financial intermediaries, as well as the role of stress tests and monetary policy in managing the risks of contingent credit under stress.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31909,31909,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
"Automation: Theory, Evidence, and Outlook",Pascual Restrepo,"This article reviews the literature on automation and its impact on labor markets, wages, factor shares, and productivity. I first introduce the task model and explain why this framework offers a compelling way to think about recent labor market trends and the effects of automation technologies. The task model clarifies that automation technologies operate by substituting capital for labor in a widening range of tasks. This substitution reduces costs, creating a positive productivity effect, but also reduces employment opportunities for workers displaced from automated tasks, creating a negative displacement effect. I  survey the empirical literature and conclude that there is wide qualitative support for the implications of task models and the displacement effects of automation. I conclude by discussing shortcomings of the existing literature and avenues for future research.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31910,31910,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023

Xu","We study how monetary policy and risk shocks affect asset prices in the US, the euro area, and Japan, differentiating between “traditional” monetary policy and communication events, each decomposed into “pure” and information shocks. Communication shocks from the US spill over to risk in the euro area and vice versa, but traditional US shocks show no spillover effects to risk. Both monetary policy and communication shocks spill over to stocks, with euro area information spillovers being particularly strong. US spillovers are consistent with global CAPM intuition whereas euro area spillovers are larger.

Debt  Flexibility,"Rhys Bidder, Nicolas Crouzet, Margaret M. Jacobson, Michael Siemer","This paper documents new facts on the modification of bank loans using FR Y-14Q regulatory data on C&I loans. We find that loan-level modifications of key contractual terms, such as interest and maturity, occur at least once for 41 percent of loans. Cross sectional differences in modifications are substantial and amplified by borrower distress. Relative to single-lender loans, syndicated loans are 1.5 times more likely to be modified and interest rate changes are twice as likely. Our findings call into question whether 1) creditor dispersion makes loan modifications more challenging and 2) relationship lending between banks and small borrowers creates more scope for flexibility when borrower-level conditions change.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/debt-flexibility.htm,2023-076,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/29/2023
The Opioid Epidemic and Consumer Credit Supply: Evidence from Credit Cards,"Sumit Agarwal, Wenli Li, Raluca A. Roman, Nonna Sorokina","To identify causal effects, we employ instrumental variables, propensity score matching, and contiguous counties techniques and control for varying local economic conditions and demographics. We find that banks contract credit supply to consumers in counties highly exposed to opioid abuse by offering higher interest rates, lower credit card limits, and fewer rewards and reducing credit offers overall. Further analyses using the supervisory Federal Reserve Y-14M credit card data set confirm these effects. What is more, the credit contraction disproportionately impacts riskier consumers, minorities (particularly Black people), low-income consumers, and younger individuals. Our examination of various state-level anti-opioid abuse legislation shows that opioid supply-oriented laws are somewhat helpful in curbing opioid overdoses or mitigating the credit supply contraction, but demand-oriented laws are not. Finally, we uncover the real effects associated with the opioid abuse-induced credit contraction: Local consumer spending significantly declines in the highly affected areas, with important macro-policy implications.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-finance/consumer-credit/the-opioid-epidemic-and-consumer-credit-supply-evidence-from-credit-cards,23-28,20-Nov-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,11/29/2023

The financial origins of regional inequality," Anne Beck, Sebastian Doerr","An increasing number of policies addresses spatial inequality, which is believed to lie at the heart of economic and social cleavages, including entrenched poverty, deaths of despair, and political polarization. Yet little is known about the origins of the gap between prospering urban and ""left-behind"" rural areas that has emerged since the 1980s. We provide new evidence on the role of banking deregulation in explaining this rural-urban divergence in incomes. In particular, we show that the income gap widened following the removal of geographic restrictions on banking. While deregulation promoted an overall increase in incomes, the increase was significantly larger in urban counties. We show that this is due to increased competition in the banking industry in cities post deregulation. Competition benefited financially constrained small and young firms, thereby boosting employment and incomes in urban areas. Our findings inform the debate on regional inequality and the design of place-based policies.",https://www.bis.org/publ/work1151.htm,1151,11/29/2023,BIS,11/29/2023

Risk Management in Monetary Policymaking: The 1994-95 Fed Tightening Episode,Kevin L. Kliesen,"The 1994-95 Fed tightening episode was one of the most notable in the Fed’s history. First, the FOMC raised the policy rate by 300 basis points in a year, even though headline and core inflation were trending lower prior to the liftoff that occurred in February 1994. Second, the Fed’s actions caught the Treasury market by surprise, triggering a sharp decline in long-term bond prices. Third, Fed Chair Alan Greenspan and the Federal Open Market Committee were regularly surprised that inflation was not rising by more than the forecasts suggested during the episode. This article presents some evidence that the Greenbook forecast systemically, albeit modestly, overpredicted CPI inflation during the tightening period. Greenspan eventually concluded that the nascent strengthening in labor productivity growth that was a key factor in restraining the growth of unit labor costs, and thus in keeping inflation pressures in check. At the same time, the success of the episode stemmed importantly from the decision by Greenspan and the FOMC to increase the policy rate to a level deemed restrictive for most of 1995. This effort reduced longer-run inflation expectations without triggering a recession. By that metric the 1994-95 tightening episode was a roaring success. Although not the focus of this article, the 1994-95 tightening episode holds important lessons for the FOMC in late 2023, which is attempting to defuse a sharp and unexpected increase in headline and core inflation to levels not seen since the early 1980s without triggering a recession.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-030,2023-030A,23-Dec,FED-STLOUIS,12/1/2023

The econometric analysis reveals a strong, positive impact of policy and globalization on cross-border patent flows, especially from North to South.

This estimated time varying correlation is shown to be consistent with the predictions of a standard New Keynesian model with a lower bound on interest rates and a trend decline in the natural rate of interest. In one equilibrium of the model, higher uncertainty raises the probability of large shocks that leave the central bank constrained by the lower bound and unable to offset negative shocks.

The Role of Technology and Energy Substitution in Climate Change Mitigation,Nida Çakır Melek and Musa Orak,"Mitigating climate change is critically linked to reducing an economy’s reliance on fossil energy. This paper examines U.S. energy dependence, measured by its factor share, using a neoclassical framework in a systematic way. We propose substitution as a simple, explicit economic mechanism for climate change mitigation and understanding energy-saving technical change in terms of observed factor quantities. We show that with time-varying capital equipment and energy substitutability, changes in observed inputs alone can account for most of the variations in the income share of energy over the last 60 years. Advancing the accessibility and quality of capital equipment as well as integrating the dynamic substitutability between energy and capital equipment into the design of climate policies can help economies adapt and achieve environmental policy goals.",https://doi.org/10.18651/RWP2023-15,2023-15,12/1/2023,FED-KANSASCITY,12/1/2023

We use data on interest rate options and inflation compensation to estimate how the probability that the zero lower bound will bind in the future has weighed on inflation expectations in the United States. Over the 2008–19 period, we estimate that the zero lower bound imparted only a small drag on longer-term inflation expectations of around 10 basis points. We argue that the Federal Reserve's forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases largely offset the potential disinflationary effects of the zero lower bound, even prior to the formal adoption of an average inflation-targeting framework.",https://doi.org/10.18651/RWP2023-14,2023-14,12/1/2023,FED-KANSASCITY,12/1/2023
"California Wildfires, Property Damage, and Mortgage Repayment","Siddhartha Biswas, Mallick Hossain, David Zink","A previous version of this working paper was originally published in March 2023. We find that 90-day delinquencies were 4 percentage points higher and prepayments were 16 percentage points higher for properties that were damaged by wildfires compared to properties 1 to 2 miles outside of the wildfire perimeter, which suggests higher risks to mortgage markets than found in previous studies. We find no significant changes in delinquency or prepayment for undamaged properties inside a wildfire boundary. Prepayments are not driven by increased sales or refinances, suggesting insurance claims drive prepayment. Almost 40 percent of affected households receive insurance settlements lower than the estimated replacement costs that define coverage limits. This underpayment and the resulting deficits imply that households receive about $200,000 to $300,000 less than their entitled amount under California law.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-finance/mortgage-markets/california-wildfires-property-damage-and-mortgage-repayment,23-05,21-Nov-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,12/4/2023
The Intergenerational Effects of Parental Leave: Exploiting Forty Years of U.S. Policy Variation,"Andrea M. Flores, George-Levi Gayle, Andrés Hincapié","We study the effects of job-protected leave policies on intergenerational mobility, long-run child outcomes, and parental decisions (labor market, investments in children, and fertility). We merge rich sources of historical information on family leave policies across the United States since 1973 with over 40 years of survey data covering two generations of individuals. Exploiting variation in the timing of job-protected leave policies introduced in a large set of 18 states and the District of Columbia before the enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in 1993, we find that the pre-FMLA protected leave policies had a level effect and a mobility effect. The level effect yields from overall improvements in education and wages for the children born under these policies. The mobility effect, chiefly an increase in intergenerational mobility in education, stems from heterogeneity in the effects of the policies: children of mothers with fewer years of education benefit more. As a potential mechanism, we find that the policies increased mothers’ time investments in children and the likelihood of the households having childcare expenses. Finally, consistent with the tradeoffs of policy design, we find that the policies exacerbated the motherhood penalty in labor market outcomes and that they affected fertility choices, increasing the likelihood of having a first child and decreasing the likelihood of having subsequent children.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31911,31911,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Distributional Tax Analysis in Theory and Practice: Harberger Meets Diamond-Mirrlees,"Emmanuel Saez, Gabriel Zucman","This paper proposes a new framework to study the distribution of taxes and the effects of tax reforms, connecting classical tax incidence analysis to optimal tax theory. To study the distribution of current taxes, labor taxes are assigned to the corresponding workers, capital taxes to the corresponding asset owners, and consumption taxes to consumers. The tax rates are the wedges between pre-tax prices (relevant for production) and after-tax prices (relevant for the work, saving, and consumption decisions of households). In contrast to the conventional approach that shifts taxes across production factors, our approach measures actual incomes, is internally consistent, and maximizes the comparability of tax progressivity and inequality over time and across countries. Applying this methodology to the United States, we find that the effective tax rate of the top 1% has declined from about 50% in the early 1950s to 32% in 2021. It is through the corporate tax that a high degree of tax progressivity was achieved in the middle of the 20th century. To analyze the distributional effects of tax reforms, mechanical changes in tax liability by income groups and aggregate revenue effects due to household behavioral responses are sufficient statistics in neoclassical optimal tax models. The effects of taxes on pre-tax prices at the heart of classical tax incidence analysis are irrelevant. This neoclassical framework can be extended to incorporate non-standard behavioral responses uncovered by the recent empirical literature. We apply this framework by providing a distributional analysis of frequently discussed tax reforms, including replacing employer-provided health insurance contributions by a payroll tax.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31912,31912,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
The Distributional Predictive Content of Measures of Inflation Expectations,"James Mitchell, Saeed Zaman","This paper examines the predictive relationship between the distribution of realized inflation in the US and measures of inflation expectations from households, firms, financial markets, and professional forecasters. To allow for nonlinearities in the predictive relationship we use quantile regression methods. We find that the ability of households to predict future inflation, relative to that of professionals, firms, and the market, increases with inflation. While professional forecasters are more accurate in the middle of the inflation density, households’ expectations are more useful in the upper tail. The predictive ability of measures of inflation expectations is greatest when combined. We show that it is helpful to let the combination weights on different agents’ expectations of inflation vary by quantile when assessing inflationary pressures probabilistically.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2331-distributional-predictive-content-inflation-expectations-measures,23-31,11.30.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,12/4/2023

The Wealth of Working Nations,"Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Gustavo Ventura, Wen Yao","Due to population aging, GDP growth per capita and GDP growth per working-age adult have become quite different among many advanced economies over the last several decades. Countries whose GDP growth per capita performance has been lackluster, like Japan, have done surprisingly well in terms of GDP growth per working-age adult. Indeed, from 1998 to 2019, Japan has grown slightly faster than the U.S. in terms of per working-age adult: an accumulated 31.9% vs. 29.5%. Furthermore, many advanced economies appear to be on parallel balanced growth trajectories in terms of working-age adults despite important differences in levels. Motivated by this observation, we calibrate a standard neoclassical growth model in which the growth of the working-age adult population varies in line with the data for each economy. Despite the underlying demographic differences, the calibrated model tracks output per working-age adult in most economies of our sample. Our results imply that the growth behavior of mature, aging economies is not puzzling from a theoretical perspective.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31914,31914,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Federal Reserve Structure and the Production of Monetary Policy Ideas,"Michael D. Bordo, Edward S.

We document the introduction of monetarism, rational expectations, credibility, transparency, and other monetary policy ideas by Reserve Banks into the Federal Reserve System. We argue that the Reserve Banks were willing to support and develop new ideas due to internal reforms to the FOMC that Chairman William McChesney Martin implemented in the 1950s and the increased ties with academia that developed in this period. Furthermore, the Reserve Banks were able to succeed at this because of their private-public governance structure. We illustrate this with a time-consistency model in which a decentralized organization is better at producing new ideas than a centralized one. We argue that this role of the Reserve Banks is an important benefit of the Federal Reserve’s decentralized structure by allowing for more competition in formulating ideas and by reducing groupthink.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31915,31915,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
The Outlook for Women's Employment and Labor Force Participation,Stefania Albanesi,"Employment and participation rates for US prime age women rose steadily during the second half of the 20th century. In the last 30 years, however, those rates stagnated, even as employment and participation rates for women in other industrialized countries continued to rise. I discuss the role of changes in the earnings structure and persistent institutional barriers, such as limited investment in family policies, that may be holding back employment among American women today. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced employment more for women than for men and raised the barriers to female participation due to the increase in childcare responsibilities during this period. Yet, the diffusion of remote and hybrid work arrangements in its aftermath may be beneficial for women's participation in the long run, even if  both men's and women's post-pandemic employment growth so far are strongly associated with access to remote work options.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31916,31916,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Age and Suicide Impulsivity: Evidence from Handgun Purchase Delay Laws,"John J. Donohue, Samuel V. Cai, Arjun Ravi","We provide the first quasi-experimental estimates of variation in suicide impulsivity by age by examining the impact of firearm purchase delay laws by age. Prior studies of firearm purchase delay laws use traditional two-way-fixed-effects estimation, but we demonstrate that bias due to heterogenous treatment effects may have inflated previous estimates relative to our stacked-regression approach. We also develop a triple-difference stacked-regression estimator to confirm the robustness of our results. We find that purchase delay laws reduce firearm suicide for the overall adult population, but this effect is largely driven by a 6.1 percent reduction in firearm suicides for young adults ages 21-34. We demonstrate that the relationship between purchase delay laws and firearm suicide reduction weakens with age and is not driven by gun ownership rates. We argue that this is due to the impulsiveness of young adults in committing suicide, indicating that removing firearm access for young adults may provide a critical deterrent to suicide.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31917,31917,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023

This problem has been especially acute for women, who are more difficult to link because their surnames often change between childhood and adulthood. In this paper, we use a new dataset, the Census Tree, that overcomes these issues by building on information from an online genealogy platform. Users of the platform have private information that allows them to create links among the 1850 to 1940 decennial censuses; the Census Tree combines these links with others obtained using machine learning and traditional linking methods to produce a dataset with hundreds of millions of census-to-census links, nearly half of which are for women. With these data, we produce estimates of the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status from fathers to their sons and daughters. We find that for married men and women, the patterns of mobility over this period are remarkably similar. Single women, however, are less mobile than their male counterparts. We also present new estimates that show that assortative mating was much stronger than previously estimated for the US.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31918,31918,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Browsers Don’t Lie? Gender Differences in the Effects of the Indian COVID-19 Lockdown on Digital Activity and Time Use,"Amalia R. Miller, Kamalini Ramdas, Alp Sungu","We measure the impact of the initial Indian national COVID-19 lockdown on digital activity using browser histories of 1,094 individuals, spanning over 31.5 million website visits on computers and mobile devices. Reflecting the predicted increase in the value of online activity, both men and women in our sample dramatically increased their internet browsing during the lockdown. However, men’s browsing increased by significantly more, causing gender gaps overall and in key browsing categories, and in browsing on mobile devices. Our browser data showed significant relative reductions in women’s online job search, corroborated in aggregate data obtained from a major Indian online job platform, indicating potentially persistent harms to women’s employment. Consistent with increased childcare obligations driving the observed gender gaps, we find that gaps were greatest among parents. Men and women in our sample had similar browsing levels and trends pre-pandemic, which diverged during the lockdown. Our primary findings therefore shed new light on determinants of digital time use, while also highlighting the importance of considering both extensive and intensive margins of digital activity to track the digital divide. In our secondary analysis of time devoted to childcare, we find conflicting survey responses between fathers (who report an increase relative to mothers) and mothers (who report no such increase). While our data cannot directly resolve this conflict, they do show fathers having larger increases in time spent online, with no relative increase in childcare-related browsing. This secondary result demonstrates the value of complementing survey data with digital trace data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31919,31919,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
How Much Are the Poor Losing From Tax Competition?,Mathilde Muñoz,"This paper quantifies the unequal welfare effects of tax competition. I derive the optimal tax and transfer schedules in a free mobility union composed of countries that can either compete or set a uniform federal tax rate. In the absence of fiscal coordination, governments internalize that any decentralized tax reform can lead to the out-migration of taxpayers at the top of the income distribution while increasing the in-migration of transfer recipients. As a result, the optimal level of redistribution is always lower in the tax competition equilibrium. Numerical calibrations show that being in a competition union rather than in a federal union decreases poorer individuals’ welfare by up to -20 percent. In contrast, the rich experience higher welfare in the tax competition equilibrium due to lower tax rates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31920,31920,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Climate Change Mitigation and Policy Spillovers in the EU’s Immediate Neighborhood,"Serhan Cevik, Nadeem Ilahi, Krzysztof Krogulski, Grace B Li, Sabiha Mohona, Yueshu Zhao","EU’s neighborhood countries (EUN) have lagged the EU on emissions mitigation; coal-heavy power generation and industrial sectors are a key factor. They have also trailed EU countries in emissions mitigation policies since 2000, with little use of market-based instruments, and they still have substantial fossil fuel subsidies. Increasingly stringent EU mitigation policies are asociated with lower emissions in EUN. Overall output effects of the CBAM, in its current form, would be limited, though exports and emissions-intensive industries could be heavily impacted. A unilaterally adopted economywide carbon tax of $75 per ton would significantly lower emissions by 2030, with minimal consequences for output or household welfare, though a safety net for the affected workers may be necessary. To become competitive today by attracting green FDI and technology, overcoming infrastructure constraints and integrating into EU’s supply chains, EUN countries would be well served to front load decarbonization, rather than postpone it for later.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/30/Climate-Change-Mitigation-and-Policy-Spillovers-in-the-EUs-Immediate-Neighborhood-541902,WPIEA2023246,"Fri, 01 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/4/2023

Winners and Losers from the U.S.-China Trade War,"Alicia H. Dang, Kala Krishna, Yingyan Zhao","We investigate the phenomenon of trade re-allocations across countries as a result of the U.S.- China trade war. Using quarterly data on U.S. imports, we find evidence, as do others, of trade diversion in a range of industries and products, including products not targeted by U.S. tariffs on China. We are however the first to ask what seems to drive these trade reallocation activities. First, we show that they seem to be driven by differences in comparative advantage across countries: countries with a greater revealed comparative advantage in a product benefit (in terms of exports to the U.S.) more from U.S. tariffs on China. Second, we show that there is evidence of spillovers to similar non-targeted products: products in similar industries (as defined by their HS codes) are also similarly affected. This is consistent with the colocation effects. Third, our findings also suggest that bystander countries with greater capital abundance are more heavily impacted in capital-intensive industries, suggesting that a higher proportion of more flexible or transferable assets provides flexibility to alter production to respond to new trade opportunities. Finally, we show that the countries that export more to the U.S. as a result of the tariffs on China also export more to other countries. This suggests that firms are entering these countries and once there, export not just to the U.S. but everywhere.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31922,31922,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Macroeconomic Announcement Premium,"Hengjie Ai, Ravi Bansal, Hongye Guo","The paper reviews the evidence on the macroeconomic announcement premium and its implications on equilibrium asset pricing models. Empirically, a large fraction of the equity market risk premium is realized on a small number of trading days with significant macroeconomic announcements. We review the literature that demonstrates that the existence of the macroeconomic announcement premium implies that investors' preferences must satisfy generalized risk sensitivity. We show how this conclusion generalizes to environments with heterogeneous investors and demonstrate how incorporating generalized risk sensitivity affects economic analysis in dynamic setups with uncertainty.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31923,31923,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Can Socially-Minded Governance Control the AGI Beast?,Joshua S. Gans,"This paper robustly concludes that it cannot. A model is constructed under idealised conditions that presume the risks associated with artificial general intelligence (AGI) are real, that safe AGI products are possible, and that there exist socially-minded funders who are interested in funding safe AGI even if this does not maximise profits. It is demonstrated that a socially-minded entity formed by such funders would not be able to minimise harm from AGI that might be created by unrestricted products released by for-profit firms. The reason is that a socially-minded entity has neither the incentive nor ability to minimise the use of unrestricted AGI products in ex post competition with for-profit firms and cannot preempt the AGI developed by for-profit firms ex ante.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31924,31924,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Pre-LBO Credit Market Conditions and Post-LBO Target Behavior,Seung Kwak and Charles Press,"In the context of leveraged buyouts (LBOs), this paper empirically studies the relation between pre-buyout credit market conditions and the post-buyout behavior of target companies, employing a supervisory dataset to overcome limited data availability for post-buyout target financial information. We propose an LBO-specific measure of (changes of) credit market conditions--the short-term (6-month) change of credit spreads leading up to buyout close. Using this proposed measure, we show that loosening pre-LBO credit market conditions, which are related to higher buyout leverage consistent with the literature, are associated with poor post-LBO (operating) performance of the target company. These results support the narrative of agency costs of debt such as risk shifting and debt overhang but are inconsistent with theories of disciplinary effects of debt. We provide further evidence supportive of the theories of agency costs of debt and some results favorable to the risk shifting story.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/pre-LBO-credit-market-conditions-and-post-LBO-target-behavior.htm,2023-077,23-Dec,FED-BOARD,12/4/2023
The Impact of AI and Cross-Border Data Regulation on International Trade in Digital Services: A Large Language Model,"Ruiqi Sun, Daniel Trefler","The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and of cross-border restrictions on data flows has created a host of new questions and related policy dilemmas. This paper addresses two questions: How is digital service trade shaped by (1) AI algorithms and (2) by the interplay between AI algorithms and cross-border restrictions on data flows? Answers lie in the palm of your hand: From London to Lagos, mobile app users trigger international transactions when they open AI-powered foreign apps. We have 2015-2020 usage data for the most popular 35,575 mobile apps and, to quantify the AI deployed in each of these apps, we use a large language model (LLM) to link each app to each of the app developer's AI patents. (This linkage of specific products to specific patents is a methodological innovation.) Armed with data on app usage by country, with AI deployed in each app, and with an instrument for AI (a Heckscher-Ohlin cost-shifter), we answer our two questions. (1) On average, AI causally raises an app's number of foreign users by 2.67 log points or by more than 10-fold.  (2) The impact of AI on foreign users is halved if the foreign users are in a country with strong restrictions on cross-border data flows.  These countries are usually autocracies. We also provide a new way of measuring AI knowledge spillovers across firms and find large spillovers. Finally, our work suggests numerous ways in which LLMs such as ChatGPT can be used in other applications.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31925,31925,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023

The Channels of International Comovement,Omar Barbiero,"How does exposure to international markets affect returns and cash flow comovements? Foreign bond owners, lenders, affiliates, investors, customers, and suppliers all transmit country shocks to companies. Most multinationals have many of these exposures simultaneously within the same foreign market. Returns and cash flows of two companies comove when exposed to the same country through the same channel. Within-country exposure through different channels is generally associated with lower comovement, in line with an operational hedging strategy. This evidence can help reconcile how, on average, increased market integration does not lead to increased comovement.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/the-channels-of-international-comovement,23-16,27-Nov-23,FED-BOSTON,12/4/2023
The Impact of a Man-made Disaster on Consumer Credit Outcomes: Evidence from the 2018 Merrimack Valley Natural Gas Explosions,Bo Zhao,"This paper is the first to empirically examine the impact of a man-made disaster on consumer credit outcomes. It uses the 2018 Merrimack Valley natural gas explosions as a quasi-random natural experiment and shows that the explosions had a temporary negative effect on debt balances, credit limits, and the number of delinquencies, and did not affect credit scores. The decreases in debt balances and credit limits were likely driven by a decline in credit demand when the affected individuals faced severe life disruption, great uncertainty, and negative financial shocks associated with the disaster. It took some time for the explosions to have an impact on delinquencies, suggesting that the affected individuals may have received short-term forbearance or used default as a last resort. The lack of large, long-lasting effects of the explosions likely reflects the critical role that external assistance to the affected communities played in mitigating the disaster’s impact.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/the-impact-of-a-man-made-disaster-on-consumer-credit-outcomes,23-17,28-Nov-23,FED-BOSTON,12/4/2023
Who Bears Climate-Related Physical Risk?,"Natee Amornsiripanitch, David Wylie","Current expected damage from climate-related perils is approximately $19 billion per year. Severe convective storms and inland floods account for almost half of the expected damage. The central and southern parts of the U.S. are most exposed to climate-related physical risk, with hurricane-exposed areas on the Gulf and South Atlantic coasts being the riskiest areas. Relative to currently low-risk areas, currently high-risk areas have lower household incomes, lower labor market participation rates, and lower education attainment, suggesting that the distribution of climate-related physical risk is correlated with economic inequality. By 2050, under business-as-usual emissions, average expected damage is projected to increase monotonically with current average expected damage, which implies that long-term policies that aim to mitigate climate-related physical risk are likely to be progressive.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/regional-economics/who-bears-climate-related-physical-risk,23-29,27-Nov-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,12/4/2023
Sovereign Debt and Credit Default Swaps (Revised November 2023),"Gaston Chaumont, Grey Gordon, Bruno Sultanum and Elliot  Tobin","How do credit default swaps (CDS) affect sovereign debt markets? We analyze how liquidity, exposure to default risk, and regulation affect the answer to this question using a sovereign debt model where investors trade bonds and CDS over the counter via directed search. Restricting portfolios can improve bond prices and bond-market activity, but the net effect depends on relative frictions in bond and CDS markets, the exposure of investors, and how the sovereign responds to the policy. Our novel identification strategy exploits confidential microdata to quantify trading frictions and the exposure distribution. The calibrated model generates realistic CDS-bond basis deviations, bid-ask spreads, and CDS volumes and positions. Our baseline specification predicts trading frictions and an inability to short sell bonds significantly improves sovereign debt prices, but policies that restrict CDS trading have small effects.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-05,23-05R,29-Nov-23,FED-RICHMOND,12/4/2023
The Role of Policy in Prison Growth and Decline,"Derek Neal, Armin Rick","Between 1975 and 2008, the US incarceration rate increased by roughly 400 percent. Trends in crime rates, arrest rates per crime committed, conviction rates per arrest, and expected time-served in prison given conviction all influence trends in incarceration rates. Available data do not allow researchers to precisely measure the contribution of each of these factors to the US prison boom. However, increases in expected prison time-served among those arrested for many different offenses were the most important drivers of rising incarceration rates. We argue that changes in policies that govern sentencing and parole are the likely drivers of these increases. We also discuss potential reforms that may reduce expected time-served among convicted offenders while minimizing harm to public safety.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/the-role-of-policy-in-prison-growth-and-decline/,2023-150,30-Nov-23,BFI,12/4/2023
Geoeconomic Fragmentation: What’s at Stake for the EU,"Chikako Baba, Ting Lan, Aiko Mineshima, Florian Misch, Magali Pinat, Asghar Shahmoradi, Jiaxiong Yao, Rachel   Elkan","Geoeconomic fragmentation (GEF) is becoming entrenched worldwide, and the European Union (EU) is not immune to its effects. This paper takes stock of GEF policies impinging on—and adopted by—the EU and considers how exposed the EU is through trade, financial and technological channels. Motivated by current policies adopted by other countries, the paper then simulates how various measures—raising costs of trade and technology transfer and fossil fuel prices, and imposition of sectoral subsidies—would affect the EU economy. Due to its high-degree of openness, the EU is found to be exposed to GEF through multiple channels, with simulated losses that differ significantly across scenarios. From a welfare perspective, this suggests the need for a cautious approach to GEF policies.

The resulting dataset covers an unbalanced panel of 40 countries over the period from 1970Q1 to 2021Q4. For each country, the index measures the extent to which a median-income household can qualify for a mortgage loan to purchase an average-priced home.

We make use of novel measures of exogenous variation in conventional rate policy, forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) based on high-frequency asset-price surprises around Federal Open Market Committee meetings. The identification relies on relatively weak assumptions and accounts for the possible presence of residual endogenous components—such as central bank information effects—in these monetary policy surprises. We find that: (i) forward guidance and LSAPs trigger much larger spillovers than conventional rate policy; (ii) spillovers transmit predominantly through financial channels centering on global investors’ risk appetite and manifest in changes in equity prices, bond spreads, capital flows and the dollar exchange rate; (iii) LSAPs trigger immediate international portfolio re-balancing between US and advanced-economy bonds, but generally entail only rather limited term premium spillovers;(iv) both forward guidance and LSAPs entail trade-offs for emerging-market-economy central banks, either between stabilizing output and prices or between additionally ensuring financial stability in terms of capital inflows.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2881~a2c5c8070a.en.pdf?2b1e4e1086b6dab3280a0feba0de5e6e,2881,5-Dec-23,ECB,12/5/2023
Inflation and fiscal policy: is there a threshold effect in the fiscal reaction function?,"Clémence Briodeau, Cristina Checherita-Westphal","This paper estimates a fiscal reaction function (FRF) framework for euro area countries to test for the impact of changes in inflation on fiscal policy. We find evidence of non-linear short-term effects of HICP inflation on the primary balance after controlling for other relevant factors. Over the period 1999-2022, we unveil an inverse U-turn relationship and an inflation turning point - beyond which its short-term (contemporaneous) impact on the primary balance starts being negative - at somewhat above 4% for the sample of mature euro area economies (EA-12, first twelve EA members) and around 6% for the whole sample of euro area countries in 2022 (EA-19). Using an alternative measure of “inflation surprise” (available for the period 2003-2022) yields robust results in the larger EA-19 sample and lowers the threshold to just below 5%. In terms of channels, the non-linear effects are found to propagate through both the primary expenditure and the revenue ratio (more robustly through the former) in the EA-12 sample, while only the combined effect on the primary balance seems to prevail for EA-19. These results reflect primarily the most recent high inflation episode and indicate that in such conditions inflation can be costly for public finance flows even in the shorter run.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2880~c8663668e0.en.pdf?473a4c18ea0fee5b18b1e9b101f042b7,2880,5-Dec-23,ECB,12/5/2023
The Increasing Pace of Weather-Related Cost Shocks: Should Net Domestic Product be Affected by Climate Disasters?,"Brian Sliker, Leonard Nakamura","The monetary costs of weather and climate disasters in the U.S. grew rapidly from 1980 to 2022, rising more than five percent in real terms annually, and implying a faster depreciation of real assets. We argue that the expected depreciation from these events could be included in consumption of fixed capital, leading to lower levels, and slightly slower growth rates, of Net Domestic Product. We use Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood regressions to estimate this expectation and generate our experimental measure of costs. An alternative calculation of depreciation and Net Domestic Product might be derived from the time series of costs incurred, rather than the far smoother expectation. This latter, realized series might be more appropriate for a national income satellite account.

Using 2015–2022 Current Population Survey data on worker occupational choices matched to licensing-policy data, I show that the existence of licensing regulation significantly reduces the probability that a worker enters an occupation.

The Neyman-Rubin causal model is based on the language of potential outcomes and was largely developed by statisticians. Instead of being based on thought experiments, it takes statistical experiments as its foundation. The Do-Calculus, developed by Judea Pearl and co-authors, relies on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and is a popular causal framework in computer science and applied mathematics. We make the case that economists who uncritically use these frameworks often discard the substantial benefits of the econometric causal model to the detriment of more informative analyses.

Climate and Cross-Border Migration,"Paula Beltran, Metodij Hadzi-Vaskov","Our work is positioned at the intersection of migration and climate change—two key forces shaping the economic outlook of many countries. The analysis explores: (i) the relative importance of origincountry vs destination-country factors in explaining migration patterns; (ii) importance of climate disasters as driver of cross-border migration; and (iii) the importance of climate-driven migration on the overall impact of climate on macroeconomic outcomes. It arrives at the following main findings. First, both origin-country and destination-country contribute to explaining migration outflows from EMDEs, although only the global shocks seem important for advanced economies. Second, climate disasters are important for explaining the origincountry migration shocks in LICs and EMDEs, are especially relevant for smaller countries, and lead to migration of both genders, albeit relatively more for males out of LICs. Third, important portion of climate’s overall impact on economic outcomes—especially agricultural GDP, remittances, and inequality—is captured via climate-driven migration.

The Labor Market Effects of Legal Restrictions on Worker Mobility,"Matthew S. Johnson, Kurt J. Lavetti, Michael Lipsitz","We analyze how the legal enforceability of noncompete agreements (NCAs) affects labor markets. Using newly-constructed panel data, we find that higher NCA enforceability diminishes workers’ earnings and job mobility, with larger effects among workers most likely to sign NCAs. These effects are far-reaching: changes in enforceability impose externalities on workers across state borders, suggesting that enforceability broadly affects labor market dynamism. We provide evidence that NCA enforceability primarily affects wages through its effect on workers' outside options; moreover, workers facing high enforceability are unable to leverage tight labor markets to increase earnings. We motivate these findings by embedding NCA enforceability in a search model with bargaining. Finally, higher NCA enforceability exacerbates gender and racial earnings gaps.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31929,31929,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Eliciting Willingness-to-Pay to Decompose Beliefs and Preferences that Determine Selection into Competition in Lab Experiments,"Yvonne Jie Chen, Deniz Dutz, Li Li, Sarah Moon, Edward J. Vytlacil, Songfa Zhong","This paper develops a partial-identification methodology for analyzing self-selection into alternative compensation schemes in a laboratory environment. We formulate a model of self-selection in which individuals select the compensation scheme with the largest expected valuation, which depends on individual- and scheme-specific beliefs and non-monetary preferences. We characterize the resulting sharp identified sets for individual-specific willingness-to-pay, subjective beliefs, and preferences, and develop conditions on the experimental design under which these identified sets are informative. We apply our methods to examine gender differences in preference for winner-take-all compensation schemes. We find that what has commonly been attributed to a gender difference in preference for performing in a competition is instead explained by men being more confident than women in their probability of winning a future (though not necessarily a past) competition.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31930,31930,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
The Power to Conserve: A Field Experiment on Electricity Use in Qatar,"Omar Al-Ubaydli, Alecia W. Cassidy, Anomitro Chatterjee, Ahmed Khalifa, Michael K. Price","High resource users often have the strongest response to behavioral interventions promoting conservation. Yet, litlle is known about how to motivate them. We implement a field experiment in Qatar, where residential customers have some of the highest energy use per capita in the world. Our dataset consists of 207,325 monthly electricity meter readings from a panel of 6,096 customers. We employ two normative treatments priming identity - a religious message quoting the Qur’an, and a national message reminding households that Qatar prioritizes energy conservation. The treatments reduce electricity use by 3.8% and both messages are equally effective. Using machine learning methods on supplemental survey data, we elucidate how agency, motivation, and responsibility activate conservation responses to our identity primes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31931,31931,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Revisiting the Eswaran-Kotwal Model of Tenancy,"Maitreesh Ghatak, Dilip Mookherjee","Persistence of sharecropping  tenancy and increases in farm productivity following regulations protecting tenant rights have been observed in many developing  countries. This paper examines if these can be explained by alternative models of sharecropping with two sided efforts/investments, namely, complete contract models either without wealth constraints (Eswaran-Kotwal (1985)), or with a wealth constrained tenant (Mookherjee (1997), Banerjee-Gertler-Ghatak (2002)); and incomplete contract holdup models without wealth constraints (Grossman-Hart (1986)). In the absence of wealth constraints the complete contract model always results in (incentive constrained) surplus-maximizing productivity, so there can be no scope for tenancy regulations to raise productivity. In the incomplete contract model, tenancy regulations would raise productivity only if the tenant's investments are more important than the landlord's investment. But in that case sharecropping tenancy would not persist in the absence of wealth constraints as the tenant would have purchased the land right ex ante from the landlord. The model with wealth constraints helps explain both the persistence of tenancy and productivity/surplus enhancing effects of tenancy regulations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31932,31932,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Optimal Exchange Rate Policy,"Oleg Itskhoki, Dmitry Mukhin","We develop a general policy analysis framework for an open economy that features nominal rigidities and financial frictions giving rise to endogenous PPP and UIP deviations. The efficient allocation can be implemented with monetary policy closing the output gap and FX interventions eliminating UIP deviations. When the “natural” real exchange rate is stable, both goals can be achieved solely by monetary policy that fixes the exchange rate — an open-economy divine coincidence. More generally, optimal policy features a managed float/crawling peg complemented with FX forward guidance and macroprudential accumulation of FX reserves, in line with the “fear of floating” observed in the data. Capital controls are not necessary to achieve the frictionless allocation, but they facilitate the extraction of rents in the currency market. Constrained unilateral policies are not optimal from the global perspective, and international cooperation features a complementary use of FX interventions across countries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31933,31933,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
An Evaluation of Protected Area Policies in the European Union,"Tristan Grupp, Prakash Mishra, Mathias Reynaert, Arthur A. van Benthem","The European Union designates 26% of its landmass as a protected area, limiting economic development to favor biodiversity. This paper uses the staggered introduction of protected-area policies between 1985 and 2020 to study the selection of land for protection and the causal effect of protection on vegetation cover and nightlights. Our results reveal protection did not affect the outcomes in any meaningful way across four decades, all countries, protection cohorts, and a wide range of land and climate attributes.

"Feeling Rich, Feeling Poor: Housing Wealth Effects and Consumption in Europe","Serhan Cevik, Sadhna Naik","Households across Europe are struggling with a double crisis—the worst inflation shock since the World War II and a sudden correction in house prices. There is a rich literature on how housing price cycles affect consumer spending, finding mixed results with a wide range of consumption responses to changes in housing wealth. In this paper, using quarterly data on 20 countries in Europe over the period 1980–2023, we analyze the dynamic relationship between inflation-adjusted housing wealth and consumer spending and obtain statistically significant and economically intuitive results. Household consumption responds positively and swiftly to changes in real house prices and gross disposable income as expected. Using the estimated coefficients, we can deduce that the average quarter-on-quarter decline of -1.96 percent in real house prices in the first quarter of 2023 in Europe could dampen consumer spending by about -0.51 percentage points in real terms on a cumulative basis over a horizon of eight quarters.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/08/Feeling-Rich-Feeling-Poor-Housing-Wealth-Effects-and-Consumption-in-Europe-542221,WPIEA2023256,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/11/2023

Firms delay disclosures in the hope that positively correlated firms will announce especially good news and lift their own price. Risk premia rise before disclosures, drop when disclosures occur, and then rise again. Conditional risk premia can be much larger than unconditional risk premia.

Scott Davis, Eric van Wincoop","Since 2007, an increase in risk or risk aversion has resulted in a US dollar appreciation and greater deviations from covered interest parity (CIP). In contrast, prior to 2007, risk had no impact on the dollar, and CIP held. To explain these phenomena, we develop a two-country model featuring (i) market segmentation, (ii) limited CIP arbitrage (since 2007), (iii) global dollar dominance. During periods of heightened global financial stress, dollar shortages in the offshore market emerge, leading to increased CIP deviations and a dollar appreciation.  The appreciation occurs even in the absence of global dollar demand shocks. Central bank swap lines  mitigate these effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31937,31937,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Impacts of the Jones Act on U.S. Petroleum Markets,"Ryan Kellogg, Richard L.

We then model counterfactual prices and product movements absent the Jones Act, allowing shippers to arbitrage price differences between the Gulf and East Coasts when they exceed transport costs. Eliminating the Jones Act would have reduced average East Coast gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel prices by $0.63, $0.80, and $0.82 per barrel, respectively, during 2018–2019, with the largest price decreases occurring in the Lower Atlantic.

Heterogeneous Impacts of Sentencing Decisions,"Andrew Jordan, Ezra Karger, Derek Neal","We examine 70,581 felony court cases filed in Chicago, IL, from 1990–2007. We exploit case randomization to assess the impact of judge assignment and sentencing decisions on the arrival of new charges. We find that, in marginal cases, incarceration creates large and lasting reductions in recidivism among first offenders. Yet, among marginal repeat offenders, incarceration creates only short-run incapacitation effects and no lasting reductions in the incidence of new felony charges. These treatment-impact differences inform ongoing legal debates concerning the merits of sentencing rules that recommend leniency for first offenders while encouraging or mandating incarceration sentences for many repeat offenders. We show that methods that fail to estimate separate outcome equations for first versus repeat offenders or fail to model judge-specific sentencing tendencies separately for cases involving first versus repeat offenders produce misleading results for first offenders.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31939,31939,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023

We develop a job search model with learning and updating to quantify the impact of perceived aggregate unemployment on subjective job-finding probabilities, revealing an overreaction to news about aggregate conditions. These beliefs can potentially offset a non-trivial part of the negative consequences of moral hazard in job search.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31940,31940,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Influencing Policy and Transforming Institutions: Lessons from Kidney/Liver Exchange,"Tayfun Sönmez, M. Utku Ünver","Kidney exchange emerges as a pioneering application in the early stages of market design. In contrast to most other successful applications in the field, where design economists primarily serve as consultants to decision-makers, in the context of kidney exchange, they assumed the role of outsider critics, ultimately succeeding in shaping real-life practices and institutions. This paper delves into the strategies that facilitated this influential role. Drawing on our two-decade involvement in shaping kidney and liver exchange clearinghouses in the United States and Turkey, we provide insights into factors pivotal for the effectiveness of market design research in shaping policy. Building upon these experiences and incorporating lessons from school choice reforms in the 2000s, Sönmez (2023) introduces a novel institutional design paradigm termed ""minimalist market design."" Recent years have witnessed tangible outcomes resulting from integrated research and policy efforts employing this framework, notably contributing to the 2021 reform of the US Army's cadet branching system and the establishment of reserve systems during the Covid-19 pandemic for vaccine and therapy allocation across multiple states.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31941,31941,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023

Sovereign Default and Tax-smoothing in the Shadow of Corruption and Institutional Weakness,"Marina Azzimonti, Nirvana Mitra","Emerging countries exhibit volatile fiscal policies and frequent sovereign debt crises, that significantly diminish the well-being of their citizens. International advisors typically suggest developed-world solutions as a remedy. We argue that the root of the problem lies in the institutional environment, which does not incentivize responsible policymaking, particularly tax-smoothing practices. Focusing on democratic representation and control of corruption, our dynamic political-economy bargaining model shows that nations with weaker institutions experience frequent default episodes and greater economic volatility. Our results are in line with stylized facts from a panel of 58 countries between 1990 and 2022. Through counterfactual experiments, we find that while emerging economy policymakers might favor moderate reforms to improve democratic representation, achieving the institutional depth seen in developed countries is politically unfeasible, despite its clear advantages for citizens.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31943,31943,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023

Econometric Causality: The Central Role of Thought Experiments,"James J.

We compare the econometric causal model with two currently popular causal frameworks: the Neyman-Rubin causal model and the Do-Calculus. The Neyman-Rubin causal model is based on the language of potential outcomes and was largely developed by statisticians. Instead of being based on thought experiments, it takes statistical experiments as its foundation. The Do-Calculus, developed by Judea Pearl and co-authors, relies on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and is a popular causal framework in computer science and applied mathematics. We make the case that economists who uncritically use these frameworks often discard the substantial benefits of the econometric causal model  to the detriment of more informative analyses. We illustrate the versatility and capabilities of the econometric framework using causal models developed in economics.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31945,31945,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
An Empirical Analysis of the Interconnection Queue,"Sarah Johnston, Yifei Liu, Chenyu Yang","Generators applying to connect to the U.S. power grid go through an interconnection queue. Most wind and solar generators that begin the process do not complete it. Using new data, we find that a long queue increases the average waiting time, and high interconnection costs are a key factor in a generator’s decision to withdraw. We develop and estimate a dynamic model of the queue and quantify the effects of policy reforms. Our simulations indicate that reducing waiting times can significantly increase completions. An alternative queuing mechanism can therefore increase completed capacity by removing certain generators to reduce congestion. A flat entry fee has a similar effect. We also quantify the effects of reforming how interconnection costs are assessed. These policy reforms lead to a substantial reduction in carbon emissions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31946,31946,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023

Among the rewards to market designers themselves is the opportunity to become intimately familiar with markets that shape the lives and careers of their participants.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31947,31947,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
"The World’s Rust Belts: The Heterogeneous Effects of Deindustrialization on 1,993 Cities in Six Countries","Luisa Gagliardi, Enrico Moretti, Michel Serafinelli","We investigate the employment consequences of deindustrialization for 1,993 cities in France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, and the United States. In all six countries we find a strong negative relationship between a city's share of manufacturing employment in the year of its country’s manufacturing peak and the subsequent change in total employment, reflecting the fact that cities where manufacturing was initially more important experienced larger negative labor demand shocks. But in a significant number of cases, total employment fully recovered and even exceeded initial levels, despite the loss of manufacturing jobs. Overall, 34% of former manufacturing hubs--defined as cities with an initial manufacturing employment share in the top tercile--experienced employment growth faster than their country's mean, suggesting that a surprisingly large number of cities was able to adapt to the negative shock caused by deindustrialization. The U.S. has the lowest share, indicating that the U.S. Rust Belt communities have fared relatively worse compared to their peers in the other countries. We then seek to understand why some former manufacturing hubs recovered while others didn't. We find that deindustrialization had different effects on local employment depending on the initial share of college-educated workers in the labor force. While in the two decades before the manufacturing peak, cities with a high college share experienced a rate of employment growth similar to those with a low college share, in the decades after the manufacturing peak, the employment trends diverged: cities with a high college share experienced significantly faster employment growth. The divergence grows over time at an accelerating rate. Using an instrumental variable based on the driving distance to historical colleges and universities, we estimate that a one standard deviation increase in local college share results in a rate of employment growth per decade that is 9.1 percentage points higher. This effect is in part explained by faster growth in human capital-intensive services, which more than offsets the loss of manufacturing jobs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31948,31948,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
How Far Has Globalization Gone? A Tale of Two Regions,"Rodolfo Campos, Samuel Pienknagura, Jacopo Timini","We study the evolution of trade globalization in a set of countries in Latin America (mostly the largest ones) and Asia over the past 25 years. Relying on structural gravity models, we first estimate a proxy of trade globalization that captures the ease of trading internationally with respect to trading domestically. Results indicate that the evolution of trade globalization since the mid-1990s has been similar between the two regions, but very heterogeneous within them. Trade globalization has been particularly strong in agriculture, mining and manufacturing, but has lagged in services. The paper also documents that trade globalization has been particularly strong in agriculture, mining and manufacturing, but it lagged in services. Within region heterogeneity is associated to a set of trade policy instruments, including tariffs, non-tariff measures, WTO membership. and trade agreements. Next, we quantify the economic implications of the estimated globalization trends. Simulations of a multi-sector trade model point to heterogeneous long-term impacts of globalization on GDP—some countries exhibiting substantial gains and others experiencing large losses—, with no single sector playing a preponderant role.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/08/How-Far-Has-Globalization-Gone-A-Tale-of-Two-Regions-542218,WPIEA2023255,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/11/2023
Natural and Neutral Real Interest Rates: Past and Future,Maurice Obstfeld,"This paper surveys the decline in real interest rates in advanced and emerging economies over the past several decades, linking that process to a range of global factors that have operated with different force in different periods. The paper argues that estimates of long-run equilibrium real rates (r̄) may not always furnish an accurate guide to the rate appropriate for short-term monetary policy (r*). It argues further that effective monetary should consider not only equilibrium in the market for domestic goods, but also the current account balance, financial conditions (including capital flows), and imperfect policy credibility. Equilibrium long-term real interest rates have risen recently according to market indicators. However, the main underlying factors that have pushed real interest rates down since the 1980s and 1990s – notably demographic shifts, lower productivity growth, corporate market power, and safe asset demand relative to supply – do not appear poised to reverse strongly enough to drive a big and durable rise in global real interest rates over the coming years.

On the Economics of Extinction and Mass Extinctions,"M. Scott Taylor, Rolf Weder","Human beings' domination of the planet has not been kind to many species worldwide. This is to be expected.  Humans have radically altered natural landscapes, harvested heavily from the ocean, and altered the climate in an unprecedented way. Recent concerns over the extent and rate of biodiversity loss have led to renewed interest in extinction outcomes and speculation concerning humans' potential role in any future mass extinction. In this paper, we discuss the economic causes of extinction in two high-profile cases - Sharks and the North American Buffalo -  and then extend our framework to allow for multiple species and the possibility of mass extinction. Throughout, we present evidence drawn from authoritative data sources with a focus on shark populations to ground our analysis.

Lawful Progress: Unveiling the Laws That Reshape Women’s Work Decisions,"Anna Fruttero, Diego B. P. Gomes, Nishtha Sharma","This paper examines the impact of women’s legal rights on labor force participation decisions made by women and men through a granular analysis of 35 gendered laws. Building on previous literature, it departs from the analysis using aggregate indices due to concerns about (i) the usability of an index for policymaking purposes, (ii) the economic interpretation of an index’s average marginal effects, (iii) and the implicit assumption of homogeneous effects underlying regressions with an index. The findings identify nine key laws that can foster female labor force participation. Notably, laws related to household dynamics and women’s agency within the family, such as divorce and property rights laws, and laws regarding the ability of women to travel outside the home, are especially important in influencing their decision to work. The paper also shows that improving women’s legal rights does not improve their labor force participation through a substitution effect as it has no systematic negative effect on men’s labor force participation.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/08/Lawful-Progress-Unveiling-the-Laws-That-Reshape-Womens-Work-Decisions-542209,WPIEA2023252,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/11/2023
Fiscal Federalism and Monetary Unions,"Rafael Berriel, Eugenia Gonzalez-Aguado, Patrick J. Kehoe, Elena Pastorino","We apply ideas from fiscal federalism to reassess how fiscal authority should be delegated within a monetary union. In a real-economy model with fiscal externalities, in which local fiscal authorities have an informational advantage about the preferences of their citizens for public spending relative to a fiscal union, a decentralized regime is optimal for small federations of countries, whereas a centralized regime is optimal for large ones. We then consider a monetary-economy model, in which governments finance their expenditures with nominal debt, and inflation has a negative impact on aggregate productivity. When the monetary authority lacks commitment, the resulting time inconsistency problem generates an indirect endogenous fiscal externality. When a country-level fiscal authority chooses a higher level of nominal debt, it induces the monetary authority to inflate more to reduce the level of distortionary taxes needed to finance the higher debt. The resulting fiscal externality naturally becomes more severe as the number of countries in the monetary union increases. Here also a decentralized fiscal regime is optimal for small monetary unions, whereas a fiscal union is optimal for sufficiently large ones. Our key result is that as the size of a monetary union increases, it becomes relatively more desirable to centralize fiscal authority.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31953,31953,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Time Use and Macroeconomic Uncertainty,"Matteo Cacciatore, Daniela Hauser, Stefano Gnocchi","We study the effects of uncertainty on time use and their macroeconomic implications. Employing data from the American Time Use Survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we document that heightened uncertainty increases housework and reduces market work hours, mildly impacting leisure. We then propose a model that  quantitatively accounts for these estimates. We show that substitution between market and housework provides self-insurance to households, weakening precautionary savings. However, it also reduces aggregate demand, ultimately amplifying uncertainty's recessionary impact. Time reallocation can lead to higher inflation, particularly when uncertainty couples with policies redirecting time use towards housework (e.g., lockdown restrictions).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31954,31954,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Occupational Hazard? An Analysis of Birth Outcomes Among Physician Mothers,"Anupam Jena, David Slusky, Lilly Springer","Training to become a physician involves long work hours that can be physically demanding, particularly for surgeons. Are birth outcomes of physician mothers affected as a result? Using Texas birth data from 2007-2014, we compared birth outcomes between physicians and another highly educated group, lawyers, and between surgeons and non-surgeon physicians. Further, using a difference-in-differences framework, we examine whether the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education 2011 duty hour reform, which lowered trainee work hours, impacted the birth outcomes of babies born to physicians compared with lawyers. We find that physicians have lower birth weights and shorter pregnancies than lawyers with the results driven by physicians in surgical specialties. However, the duty hour reform appears to not have impacted birth outcomes. Thus, we find that physicians tend to have worse birth outcomes than lawyers and, in this case, the work reform did little to address the difference.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31955,31955,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023

This gap is primarily driven by a large gender gap in the right tail of the limit distribution. At the median and in the left tail of the total limit distribution, women have larger limits than men. Results from a Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition show that 87 percent of the gap is explained by differences in the effect of observed characteristics, while 10 percent of the difference is explained by differences in the levels of observed characteristics. The gap is persistent across geographies but has varied over time.

Macro-Financial Impacts of Foreign Digital Money,"Anh Le, Alexander Copestake, Brandon  Tan, Shanaka J Peiris, Umang Rawat","We develop a two-country New Keynesian model with endogenous currency substitution and financial frictions to examine the impact on a small developing economy of a stablecoin issued in a large foreign economy. The stablecoin provides households in the domestic economy with liquidity services and an additional hedge against domestic inflation. Its introduction amplifies currency substitution, reducing bank intermediation and weakening monetary policy transmission, worsening the impacts of recessionary shocks and increasing banking sector stress. Capital controls raise stablecoin adoption as a means of circumvention, increasing exposure to spillovers from foreign shocks. Unlike a domestic CBDC, a ban on stablecoin payments can alleviate these effects.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/05/Macro-Financial-Impacts-of-Foreign-Digital-Money-542034,WPIEA2023249,"Wed, 06 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/11/2023

Optimal Taxation of Inflation,"Damien Capelle, Yang Liu","When inflation originates from distributional conflicts, shifts in inflation expectations, or energy price shocks, monetary policy (MP) is a costly stabilization instrument. We show that a tax on inflation policy (TIP), which would require firms to pay a tax proportional to the increase in their prices, would effectively correct externalities in firms’ pricing decisions, tackle excessive inflation and reduce output volatility, without exacerbating price distortions. While proposals from the 1970s saw TIP as a substitute to MP, we find that it is a complement, with TIP addressing markups and inflation expectation shocks, and MP addressing demand shocks.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/08/Optimal-Taxation-of-Inflation-542215,WPIEA2023254,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/11/2023
The Dark Side of the Moon? Fintech and Financial Stability,Serhan Cevik,"Rapid advances in digital technology are revolutionizing the financial landscape. The rise of fintech has the potential to make financial systems more efficient and competitive and broaden financial inclusion. With greater technological complexity, however, fintech also poses potential systemic risks. In this paper, I use a novel dataset to trace the development of fintech (excluding cryptocurrencies) and empirically assess its impact on financial stability in a panel of 198 countries over the period 2012–2020. The analysis provides interesting insights into how fintech correlates with financial stability: (i) the impact magnitude and statistical significance of fintech depend on the type of instrument (digital lending vs. digital capital raising); (ii) the overall effect of all fintech instruments together turns out to be negative because of the overwhelming share of digital lending in total, albeit statistically insignificant; and (iii) while digital capital raising is estimated to have a positive effect on financial stability in advanced economies, its effect is negative in developing countries. Fintech is still small compared to traditional institutions, but rapidly expanding in riskier segments of the financial sector and creating new challenges for policymakers.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/08/The-Dark-Side-of-the-Moon-Fintech-and-Financial-Stability-542212,WPIEA2023253,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/11/2023
Benchmarking Global Optimizers,"Antoine Arnoud, Fatih Guvenen, Tatjana Kleineberg","We benchmark six global optimization algorithms by comparing their performance on challenging multidimensional test functions as well as on a method of simulated moments estimation of a panel data model of earnings dynamics. Five of the algorithms are from the popular NLopt open-source library: (i) Controlled Random Search with local mutation (CRS), (ii) Improved Stochastic Ranking Evolution Strategy (ISRES), (iii) Multi-Level Single-Linkage (MLSL), (iv) Stochastic Global Optimization (StoGo), and (v) Evolutionary Strategy with Cauchy distribution (ESCH). The sixth algorithm is TikTak, which is a multistart global optimization algorithm used in some recent economic applications. For completeness, we add three popular local algorithms to the comparison—the Nelder-Mead downhill simplex algorithm, the Derivative-Free Nonlinear Least Squares (DFNLS) algorithm, and a popular variant of the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell (DFPMIN) algorithm. To give a detailed comparison of algorithms, we use benchmarking tools recently developed in the optimization literature. We find that the success rate of many optimizers varies dramatically with the characteristics of each problem and the computational budget that is available. Overall, TikTak is the strongest performer both on the test functions and the economic application. The next-best performing optimizers are StoGo for the test functions and MLSL and ISRES for the economic application.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/working-papers/benchmarking-global-optimizers,801,15-Dec-23,FED-MINNEAPOLIS,12/15/2023

The Effects of Social Security Incentives on Retirement in Spain,"Pilar García-Gómez, Silvia Garcia-Mandicó, Sergi Jimenez-Martin, Judit Vall Castelló","In this paper, we analyze the extent to what financial incentives have influenced individual and couples retirement decisions over the last two decades in Spain. We use administrative data on earnings histories to create synthetic measures of financial incentives that we link to individual survey data from the European Community Household Panel and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. The ocurrence of several major reforms in the period largely facilitates identification. We find that retirement is highly responsive to incentive variables (both ITAX and SSW). We find that a 10% change in the implicit tax rate on working longer increases the probability of retiring by about 0.70 pp (0.90 pp for men and 0.54 for women). Furthermore, we find that couple incentives matter more in husband's retirement decisions than in wife's retirement decisions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31956,31956,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023
Toxified to the Bone: Early-Life and Childhood Exposure to Lead and Men’s Old-Age Mortality,"Jason Fletcher, Hamid Noghanibehambari","Several strands of research document the life-cycle impacts of lead exposure during the critical period of children’s development. Yet little is known about long-run effects of lead exposure during early-life on old-age mortality outcomes. This study exploits the staggered installation of water systems across 761 cities in the US over the first decades of the 20th century combined with cross-city differences in materials used in water pipelines to identify lead and non-lead cities. An event-study analysis suggests that the impacts are more concentrated on children exposed during in-utero up to age 10. The results of difference-in-difference analysis suggests an intent-to-treat effect of 2.7 months reduction in old-age longevity for fully exposed cohorts. A heterogeneity analysis reveals effects that are 3.5 and 2 times larger among the nonwhite subpopulation and low socioeconomic status families, respectively. We also find reductions in education and socioeconomic standing during early adulthood as candidate mechanism. Finally, we employ WWII enlistment data and observe reductions in height-for-age among lead-exposed cohorts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31957,31957,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023

Closing the Productivity Gap with the US: Causes and Consequences of the Productivity Program in Western Europe,Michela Giorcelli,"This paper studies to what extent the transfer of US managerial technologies to Europe after World War II contributed to closing the gap with US businesses. Between 1952 and 1958, the US government sponsored the Productivity Program, which promoted management training trips for European managers at US firms. Through the analysis of reports compiled by UK, France, Germany, and Italian participating firms, I first document that these companies claimed between 5 and 10% yearly productivity increase thanks to the program. The fact that European businesses were not forced to adopt the American management model, but could adapt it to their firm needs and existing business practices was a key aspect of the program’s success. Second, using data on US and Italian participating firms’ performance I show that Italian firms grew on average 7.8 percent faster than that of US companies in the ten years after the start of the program. Moreover, the distribution of productivity of Italian and US firms became more similar over years, confirming a performance convergence between these companies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31959,31959,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023
The Cost of Climate Policy to Capital: Evidence from Renewable Portfolio Standards,"Harrison Hong, Jeffrey D. Kubik, Edward P. Shore","Many US states have set ambitious renewable portfolio standards (RPS) that require utilities to switch from fossil fuels toward renewables. RPS increases the renewables capacity, bond issuance, maturity, and yield spreads of investor-owned utilities compared to municipal producers that are exempted from this climate policy. Contrary to stranded-asset concerns, the hit to overall firm financial health is moderate. Falling cost of renewables and passthrough of these costs to consumers mitigate the burden of RPS on firms. Using a Tobin’s q model, we show that, absent these mitigating factors, the impact of RPS on firm valuations would have been severe.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31960,31960,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023

The TCJA and Domestic Corporate Tax Rates,"Christine L.

While existing research has focused primarily on publicly traded companies, data limitations have prevented more holistic analyses of the corporate sector. Using a representative sample of U.S. corporate tax returns, we highlight how trends in effective tax rates (ETRs) and exposure to the legislation's main provisions varied for public, private, multinational, domestic, and large versus small firms. We document several novel facts, including that ETRs increased on average for privately held, domestic firms and for firms in the bottom 90% of the firm sales distribution after TCJA. In contrast, public, multinational, and large firms saw substantial ETR cuts on average. We find that firms' pre-TCJA exposure to changes in the corporate tax rate and treatment of net operating losses have the strongest correlation with post-TCJA ETR changes. Overall, the analysis underscores the divergent impacts of TCJA on different firm types and illuminates the economic scope and relative significance of TCJA's myriad provisions.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-tcja-and-domestic-corporate-tax-rates.htm,2023-078,23-Dec,FED-BOARD,12/18/2023

Labor Market Stability and Fertility Decisions,"Joan Monras, Eduardo Polo-Muro, Javier Vazquez-Grenno","This paper studies how fertility decisions respond to an improvement in job stability using variation from the large and unexpected regularization of undocumented immigrants in Spain implemented during the first half of 2005. This policy change improved substantially the labor market opportunities of affected men and women, many of which left the informality of house keeping service sectors toward more formal, stable, and higher paying jobs in larger firms (Elias et al., 2023). In this paper, we estimate the effects of the regularization on fertility rates using two alternative difference-in-differences strategies that compare fertility behavior of “eligible” and “non-eligible” candidate women to obtain the legal status, both on aggregate and at the local level. Our findings suggests that gaining work permits leads to a significant increase in women fertility.

Experiments about Institutions,"Michael Callen, Jonathan L. Weigel, Noam Yuchtman","We review an emerging experimental literature studying institutional change. Institutions are a key determinant of economic growth, but the “critical junctures” in which institutions can change are not precisely defined. For example, such junctures are often identified ex post, raising methodological problems: selection on the outcome of institutional change; an inability to study beliefs, central to coordination and thus the process of institutional change; and an in- ability to conduct experiments to identify causal effects. We argue that critical junctures are identifiable in real-time as moments when there exists deep uncertainty about future institutions. Consistent with this conception, the papers reviewed: (i) examine changes to institutions, i.e., the “fundamental rules of the game”; (ii) are real-time studies of plausible critical junctures; and, (iii) use field experiments to achieve causal identification. Substantively, this literature examines institutional changes in state capacity and legitimacy, political inclusion, and political accountability. We also advocate more systematic measurement of beliefs about future institutions to identify critical junctures as they happen and provide an empirical proof of concept. Such work is urgent given contemporary critical junctures arising from democratic backsliding, state fragility, climate change, and conflicts over the rights of the marginalized.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31964,31964,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023

Using establishment-level data, we show that firms operating in multiple counties in the United States respond to heat shocks by reducing employment in the affected locations and increasing it in unaffected locations, whereas single-location firms simply downsize. Workforce reallocation, aimed at preventing heat-related decline in labor productivity, is stronger among larger, financially stable firms with more ESG-oriented investors. The scale of this response increases with the severity of climate disasters and is aided by credit availability and competitive labor markets.

Using US administrative data on worker earnings, we show that increases in risk premia lead to lower earnings for low-wage workers; these declines are primarily driven by job separations. By contrast, productivity shocks affect the earnings mainly of highly paid workers. We build an equilibrium model of labor market search that quantitatively replicates these facts.

"Inflation, War Bonds, and the Rise of Republicans in the 1950s","Gillian Brunet, Eric Hilt, Matthew S. Jaremski","We study the role of war bonds and inflation in the presidential elections of the 1950s. During World War II, the federal government conducted aggressive campaigns to convince Americans to invest their savings in wartime savings bonds. Although the bonds were nonnegotiable and protected from interest rate fluctuations, two major inflationary episodes after the war, in 1946-48 and 1950-51, eroded the real value of their returns, contributing to a political backlash against the incumbent Democrats. In a difference-in-differences framework, we find that counties with higher war bond purchases shifted their votes towards the Republican party in the postwar elections, relative to the elections of the late 1930s and early 1940s. To address concerns related to the endogeneity of war bond purchases, we instrument for WWII bond subscriptions using participation rates from the World War I liberty bonds, and find similar results. Our results indicate that the promotion of savings bonds made Americans more sensitive to the high inflation that prevailed after the war, contributing to Republicans’ victories in the 1950s.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31969,31969,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023
Can Fiscal Consolidation help Central Banks Fight Inflation?,"Jiaqian Chen, Era Dabla-Norris, Carlos Goncalves, Zoltan Jakab, Jesper Lindé","This paper argues case that a tighter fiscal policy stance can meaningfully support central banks in fighting inflation in both advanced and emerging market economies. While the standard textbook result suggest that monetary policy is much more effective than fiscal policy in battling inflation in open economies due to the exchange rate channel, we show that a tighter fiscal stance is notably more effective in the current situation. This is so because when many countries currently need to tighten the policy stance simultaneously, the exchange rate channel does not provide monetary policy with an edge over fiscal policy. We also show that fiscal consolidation can be helpful in small open emerging markets and developing economies by reaffirming their commitment to price stability, and by putting the fiscal house in order which reduces risk premiums and strengthens the currency. Furthermore, we show that spillovers from major economies can be more adverse from tighter monetary policy. By applying a two-agent New Keynesian modeling framework with unconstrained and hand-to-mouth households, we show that any adverse effects of tighter fiscal policy (relative to tighter monetary policy) on consumption inequality can be handled with a combination of general spending cuts and targeted transfers to vulnerable households.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/15/Can-Fiscal-Consolidation-help-Central-Banks-Fight-Inflation-542403,WPIEA2023260,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/18/2023
Fiscal Impacts of Climate Disasters in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies,"Habtamu Fuje, Jiaxiong Yao, Seung Mo Choi, Hamza Mighri","Climate-induced disasters are causing increasingly frequent and intense economic damages, disproportionally affecting emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) relative to advanced economies (AEs). However, the impact of various types of climate shocks on output growth and fiscal positions of EMDEs is not fully understood. This research analyzes the macro-fiscal implications of three common climate disasters (droughts, storms, and floods) using a combination of macroeconomic data and comprehensive ground and satellite disaster indicators spanning the past three decades across 164 countries. Across EMDEs, where agriculture tends to be the principal sector, a drought reduces output growth by 1.4 percentage points and government revenue by 0.7 percent of GDP as it erodes the tax bases of affected countries. Meanwhile, likely reflecting limited fiscal space to respond to a disaster, fiscal expenditure does not increase following a drought. A storm drags output growth in EMDEs, albeit with negligible impact on fiscal revenue, but government expenditure increases due to reconstruction and clean-up efforts. We find only limited impact of localized floods on growth and fiscal positions. In contrast, AEs tend to experience negligible growth and fiscal consequences from climate-induced shocks. As these shocks have much more detrimental effects in EMDEs, international support for disaster preparedness and climate change adaptation play a crucial role for these countries to confront climate change. While the standard textbook result suggest that monetary policy is much more effective than fiscal policy in battling inflation in open economies due to the exchange rate channel, we show that a tigher fiscal stance is notably more effective in the current situation. This is so because when many countries currently need to tighten the policy stance simultanously, the exchange rate channel does not provide monetary policy with an edge over fiscal policy. We also show that fiscal consolidation can be helpful in small open emerging markets and developming economies by reaffirming their commitment to price stability, and by putting the fiscal house in order which reduces risk premiums and strenghtens the currency.

"Monetary Tightening, Commercial Real Estate Distress, and US Bank Fragility","Erica Xuewei Jiang, Gregor Matvos, Tomasz Piskorski, Amit Seru","Building on the work of Jiang et al. (2023) we develop a framework to analyze the effects of credit risk on the solvency of U.S. banks in the rising interest rate environment. We focus on commercial real estate (CRE) loans that account for about quarter of assets for an average bank and about $2.7 trillion of bank assets in the aggregate. Using loan-level data we find that after recent declines in property values following higher interest rates and adoption of hybrid working patterns about 14% of all loans and 44% of office loans appear to be in a “negative equity” where their current property values are less than the outstanding loan balances. Additionally, around one-third of all loans and the majority of office loans may encounter substantial cash flow problems and refinancing challenges. A 10% (20%) default rate on CRE loans – a range close to what one saw in the Great Recession on the lower end -- would result in about $80 ($160) billion of additional bank losses. If CRE loan distress would manifest itself early in 2022 when interest rates were low, not a single bank would fail, even under our most pessimistic scenario. However, after more than $2 trillion decline in banks’ asset values following the monetary tightening of 2022, additional 231 (482) banks with aggregate assets of $1 trillion ($1.4 trillion) would have their marked to market value of assets below the face value of all their non-equity liabilities. To assess the risk of solvency bank runs induced by higher rates and credit losses, we expand the Uninsured Depositors Run Risk (UDRR) financial stability measure developed by Jiang et al. (2023) where we incorporate the impact of credit losses into the market-to-market asset calculation, along with the effects of higher interest rates. Our analysis, reflecting market conditions up to 2023:Q3, reveals that CRE distress can induce anywhere from dozens to over 300 mainly smaller regional banks joining the ranks of banks at risk of solvency runs. These findings carry significant implications for financial regulation, risk supervision, and the transmission of monetary policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31970,31970,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023
Accessing the Safety Net: How Medicaid Affects Health and Recidivism,"Analisa Packham, David Slusky","We estimate the causal impact of access to means-tested public health insurance coverage (Medicaid) on health outcomes and recidivism for those recently released from incarceration. To do so, we leverage a policy change in South Carolina that allowed simplified Medicaid re-enrollment for previously incarcerated eligible individuals. Using linked administrative data on criminal convictions and health insurance claims, we find that reducing barriers in access to Medicaid for vulnerable populations increases enrollment and utilization of health care services. However, we do not find that this improved health care insurance access reduces 1-year or 3-year recidivism, suggesting that effectiveness of such policies is context dependent.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31971,31971,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023
Financial contagion within the interbank network,"Christina D. Mikropoulou, Angelos T. Vouldis","The analysis of contagion in financial networks has primarily focused on transmission channels operating through direct linkages. This paper develops a model of financial contagion in the interbank market featuring both direct and indirect transmission mechanisms. The model is used to analyse how shocks originating from outside sectors impact the functioning of the interbank market and investigates the emergence of instability in this setting. We conduct simulations on actual interbank bilateral exposures, constructed manually from a supervisory dataset reported by the largest euro area banks. We find that while the impact of direct contagion increases gradually with the shock intensity, the effect of indirect contagion is subject to threshold effects and can increase abruptly when the threshold is exceeded. In addition, the risk posed by indirect contagion has a higher upper bound compared to direct contagion. Finally, we find that in terms of overall impact, the shocks to the value of sovereign debt and non-bank financial institutions represent the most significant risk to the functioning of the interbank market.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2883~47e3ebe468.en.pdf?20be3ab47f51e49196debcf9f2e90488,2883,18-Dec-23,ECB,12/18/2023

"Consumption, Wealth, and Income Inequality: A Tale of Tails","Alexandre Gaillard, Christian Hellwig, Philipp  Wangner, Nicolas Werquin","We provide evidence that the distributions of consumption, labor income, wealth, and capital income exhibit asymptotic power-law behavior with a strict ranking of upper tail inequality, in that order, from the least to the most unequal. We show analytically and quantitatively that the canonical heterogeneous-agent model cannot replicate the proper ranking and magnitudes of these four tails simultaneously. Mechanisms addressing the wealth concentration puzzle in these models through return heterogeneity lead to a mirror consumption concentration puzzle. We match the cross-sectional data on these four Pareto tails by positing a combination of non-homothetic, wealth-dependent preferences and scale-dependent returns to capital. We underscore the importance of these results by showing that all four dimensions of top inequality jointly determine the long-run elasticity that governs the revenue-maximizing capital tax rate.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2023/2023-43,2023-43,23-Dec,FED-CHICAGO,12/18/2023

Household Debt and Borrower-Based Measures in Finland: Insights from a Heterogeneous Agent Model,Fumitaka Nakamura,"We analyze the effects of borrower-based macroprudential tools in Finland. To evaluate the efficiency of the tools, we construct a heterogeneous agent model in which households endogenously determine their housing size and liquid asset levels under two types of borrowing constraints: (i) a loan-to-value (LTV) limit and (ii) a debt-to-income (DTI) limit. When an unexpected negative income shock hits the economy, we find that a larger and more persistent drop in consumption is observed under the LTV limit compared to the DTI limit. Our results indicate that although DTI caps tend to be unpopular with lower income households because they limit the amount they can borrow, DTI caps are beneficial even on distributional grounds in stabilizing consumption. Specifically, DTI caps mitigate the consumption decline in recessions by restricting high leverage, and thus, they can usefully complement LTV caps.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/15/Household-Debt-and-Borrower-Based-Measures-in-Finland-Insights-from-a-Heterogeneous-Agent-542425,WPIEA2023262,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/18/2023
How the Brady Plan Delivered on Debt Relief: Lessons and Implications,"Neil Shenai, Marijn A. Bolhuis","Rising debt vulnerabilities in low- and middle-income countries have rekindled interest in a Brady Plan-style mechanism to facilitate debt restructurings. To inform this debate, this paper analyzes the impact of the original Brady Plan by comparing macroeconomic outcomes of 10 Brady countries to 40 other emerging markets and developing economies. The paper finds that following the first Brady restructuring in 1990, Brady countries experienced substantial declines in public and external debt burdens and a sharp pick-up in output and productivity growth, anchored by a comparatively strong structural reform effort. The impact of the Brady Plan on overall debt burdens was many times greater than initial face value reductions, indicating the existence of a “Brady multiplier.” Brady restructurings took longer to complete than non-Brady restructurings. Today, similar mechanisms could be helpful in delivering meaningful debt stock reduction when solvency challenges are acute, but Brady-style mechanisms alone would not solve existing challenges in the sovereign debt landscape, including those related to creditor coordination, domestic barriers to economic reforms, and the increased prevalence of domestic debt, among others.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/14/How-the-Brady-Plan-Delivered-on-Debt-Relief-Lessons-and-Implications-542389,WPIEA2023258,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/18/2023
Inflation Dynamics in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): What is the Role of External Factors?,"Fozan Fareed, Abolfazl Rezghi, Charlotte Sandoz","Inflationary pressures have intensified in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 2021-2022, mainly driven by a pick-up in tradeable goods inflation. Despite this increase, inflation remained relatively contained as compared to regional comparators. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of inflation dynamics in the region, with a focus on external factors because of GCC’s high reliance on international trade. Using a Global Vector Autoregressive model with quarterly data from 1987 to 2022, we find that external factors such as the imported inflation from main trading partners, mainly driven by China, and nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) are the main drivers of inflation in the GCC region. Additionally, we find that the direct pass-through of international commodity price shocks such as oil and raw agricultural materials is somewhat limited, after controlling for trading partners’ inflation, which can be explained by the prevalence of subsidies and administered prices in the region. Overall, since external factors are the main drivers of domestic inflation in the GCC, an increased focus on diversification, promoting food security, and ensuring prudent central bank policies, including through effective liquidity management frameworks, can play a key role in managing this impact.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/15/Inflation-Dynamics-in-the-Gulf-Cooperation-Council-GCC-What-is-the-Role-of-External-Factors-542414,WPIEA2023263,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/18/2023

In OECD, large immigration waves raise domestic output and productivity in both the short and the medium term, pointing to significant dynamic gains for the host economy. We find no evidence of negative effects on aggregate employment of the native-born population.

In this paper, we characterize how goods markets drive exchange rate cyclicality, taking into account trade in risk-free and/or risky assets. We show that goods-market mechanisms come back into play, even when there is cross-border trade in two risk-free assets, as long as we allow for empirically plausible heterogeneity in the stochastic discount factors of domestic marginal investors.",https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/working-papers/2023/37/,2023-37,11/1/2023,FED-SANFRANCISCO,12/21/2023
How Important Is the Information Effect of Monetary Policy?,"Zhao Han, Chengcheng Jia","Is the ""information effect"" of monetary policy quantitatively important? We first use a simple model to show that under asymmetric information, monetary policy surprises are correlated with the unobserved state of the economy. This correlation implies that monetary policy surprises provide information about the state of the economy, and at the same time, explains why the estimation of the information effect may be biased. We then develop a New Keynesian DSGE model under asymmetric information and calibrate model parameters to match macroeconomic dynamics in the US and forecasting accuracy in the Greenbook. Under our calibration, both the central bank and the private sector initially have noisy information. Over time, the information effect of monetary policy mitigates information frictions by enhancing the two-way learning between the central bank and the private sector.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2332-how-important-is-information-effect-of-monetary-policy,23-32,12.18.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,12/21/2023
Tax Heterogeneity and Misallocation,"Barış Kaymak, Immo Schott","Companies face different effective marginal tax rates on their income. This can be detrimental to allocative efficiency unless taxes offset other distortions in the economy.

Using firm-level balance-sheet data and estimates of marginal tax rates, we find that tax heterogeneity reduces total factor productivity by about 3 percent.

"Forecasting Core Inflation and Its Goods, Housing, and Supercore Components","Todd E. Clark, Matthew V. Gordon, Saeed Zaman","This paper examines the forecasting efficacy and implications of the recently popular breakdown of core inflation into three components: goods excluding food and energy, services excluding energy and housing, and housing. A comprehensive historical evaluation of the accuracy of point and density forecasts from a range of models and approaches shows that a BVAR with stochastic volatility in aggregate core inflation, its three components, and wage growth is an effective tool for forecasting inflation's components as well as aggregate core inflation. Looking ahead, the model's baseline projection puts core inflation at 2.6 percent in 2026, well below its 2023 level but still elevated relative to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective. The probability that core inflation will return to 2 percent or less is much higher when conditioning on goods or non-housing services inflation slowing to pre-pandemic levels than when conditioning on these components remaining above the same thresholds. Scenario analysis indicates that slower wage growth will likely be associated with reduced inflation in all three components, especially goods and non-housing services, helping to return core inflation to near the 2 percent target by 2026.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2334-forecasting-core-inflation-and-its-components,23-34,12.20.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,12/21/2023
What Do Lead Banks Learn from Leveraged Loan Investors?,"Max Bruche, Ralf Meisenzahl, David Xiaoyu Xu","In leveraged loan deals, lead banks use bookbuilding to extract price-relevant information from syndicate participants.

A one-percentage-point increase in loan spread predicts a 0.8% higher excess return, a proxy for risk premium, over the first 3 months of secondary market trading. More importantly, it also predicts a 3% higher probability of subsequent default, implying that investors have private information about borrower quality that is unknown to the lead bank.

We build a novel dataset quantifying the enacted full-year appropriations for all budgetary accounts funding R&D activities at these five agencies over fiscal years 1947-2019. We use this dataset to isolate a subset of 218 “significant” changes in real appropriations for each agency, and we analyze numerous primary and secondary sources to understand the context and motivation. Based on these sources, we classify each significant change in federal R&D appropriations as either “endogenous” or “exogenous” to short-run macroeconomic developments.

"Shocks, Frictions, and Policy Regimes: Understanding Inflation after the COVID-19 Pandemic",Taeyoung Doh and Choongryul Yang,"We set- up a two-sector New Keynesian model with input-output linkages to study the persistently high inflation during the post-COVID-19 period. We include multiple shocks as well as several amplification channels of these shocks in a parsimonious model to quantify the relative importance of each factor. We calibrate the model to match the pre-COVID-19 data and alter parameters governing 1) the fiscal rule, 2) inflation feedback in the monetary policy rule, 3) elasticity of substitution among intermediary inputs in production, and 4) the size of a sectoral demand shift shock to explain the post-COVID-19 data. We obtain estimates of shocks in the model to fit goods inflation data during the post-COVID-19 period and use aggregate inflation to test the model’s ability to explain the recent inflationary episode. Although aggregate demand shocks and a sectoral demand shift shock have played a significant role in the initial inflation surge during 2021, the propagation of these shocks into the persistently high aggregate inflation was also helped by lower inflation feedback in the monetary policy response relative to the pre-COVID-19 period. Compared with other changes in parameters, this alteration of the monetary policy rule best fits the level and persistence of the post-COVID-19 aggregate inflation. While lowering the elasticity of substitution among intermediary inputs can match the level of inflation, it does a poorer job of explaining the persistence of inflation compared with allowing changes in the monetary policy rule.",https://doi.org/10.18651/RWP2023-16,2023-16,12/22/2023,FED-KANSASCITY,12/22/2023

Dealing with Imperfect Randomization: Inference for the HighScope Perry Preschool Program,"James Heckman, Rodrigo Pinto, Azeem Shaikh","This paper considers the problem of making inferences about the effects of a program on multiple outcomes when the assignment of treatment status is imperfectly randomized. By imperfect randomization we mean that treatment status is reassigned after an initial randomization on the basis of characteristics that may be observed or unobserved by the analyst. We develop a partial identification approach to this problem that makes use of information limiting the extent to which randomization is imperfect to show that it is still possible to make nontrivial inferences about the e ects of the program in such settings. We consider a family of null hypotheses in which each null hypothesis specifies that the program has no effect on one of many outcomes of interest. Under weak assumptions, we construct a procedure for testing this family of null hypotheses in a way that controls the familywise error rate- the probability of even one false rejection in infinite samples. We develop our methodology in the context of a reanalysis of the HighScope Perry Preschool program. We find statistically significant effects of the program on a number of different outcomes of interest, including outcomes related to criminal activity for males and females, even after accounting for imperfections in the randomization and the multiplicity of null hypotheses.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/dealing-with-imperfect-randomization-inference-for-the-highscope-perry-preschool-program/,2023-155,20-Dec-23,BFI,12/28/2023

Improving Regulation for Innovation: Evidence from China’s Pharmaceutical Industry,"Ruixue Jia, Xiao Ma, Jianan Yang, Yiran Zhang","This study investigates how enhanced regulation can promote innovation, focusing on the impacts of a significant regulatory reform in China's pharmaceutical sector implemented in 2015. Inspired by regulatory practices in the U.S., the reform aimed to address application backlogs and reduce administrative waiting time for new drug development. Using data at the drug and firm levels during 2012--2021, we make three main findings: (1) drug categories experiencing improved approval times witnessed a surge in investigational new drug applications and related clinical trials; (2) despite little improvement in innovativeness (measured by novel targets unexplored by U.S. counterparts) within drug categories, the reform led to changes in firm composition, attracting innovative new firms and boosting overall drug innovativeness; and (3) the market recognized the improvement in drug innovation, as reflected in stock price adjustments post new drug registrations after the reform. Our findings demonstrate that regulatory barriers can hinder the entry of innovative firms and suggest that latecomers could boost their innovation potential by adopting specific, effective regulatory practices from frontier countries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31976,31976,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
The Psychology of Poverty: Where Do We Stand?,"Johannes Haushofer, Daniel Salicath","In recent years, the psychological causes and consequences of poverty have received renewed attention from scientists and policymakers. In this review, we summarize new developments in this literature. First, we discuss advances in our understanding of the relationship between income and psychological well-being. There is a robust positive relationship between the two, both within and across countries, and in correlational and causal analyses. Second, we summarize recent work on the impact of “scarcity” and stress on economic preferences and decision-making. Our view of this literature is that the evidence is relatively weak. Third, we summarize evidence on the impact of psychological interventions on economic outcomes. Light-touch psychological interventions, such as videos that aim to raise aspirations, have shown some promise in encouraging investment and improving economic well-being. Similarly, psychotherapy and pharmacological mental health treatments have positive effects on economic outcomes. Relative to the effects of cash transfers, these impacts are small in absolute terms and large in per-dollar terms.

Firm Accommodation After Disability: Labor Market Impacts and Implications for Social Insurance,"Naoki Aizawa, Corina Mommaerts, Stephanie L.

We leverage a unique workers’ compensation (WC) program in Oregon that provides wage subsidies to firms for accommodating injured workers. Exploiting rich administrative data and a policy change to the wage subsidy, we show that accommodation rates respond to the subsidy rate and that receipt of accommodation leads to a significant increase in employment and earnings a year later. To explore welfare implications, we develop and estimate a frictional labor market model of accommodation as a form of human capital investment. Worker turnover and imperfect experience rating in WC lead to under-accommodation and inefficient labor market outcomes after workplace disability. Counterfactual simulations show that subsidizing accommodation not only improves long-run labor market outcomes of workers experiencing work-related disability but also leads to welfare gains for most workers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31978,31978,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023

The project was launched in the mid 1990s and was motivated by decades of decline in the labor force participation rate of older men. The first phases of the project documented that social security program provisions can create powerful incentives for retirement that are strongly correlated with the labor force behavior of older workers. Since then, the dramatic decline in men’s labor force participation has been replaced by sharply rising participation rates. Older women’s participation has increased dramatically as well.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31979,31979,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Creating the “American Way” of Business: Evidence from WWII in the U.S.,Michela Giorcelli,"The Second World War II (WWII) was arguably one of the largest shocks to the U.S. economic and production system in history. Historians, business historians, and economists have largely discussed the stimulus that WWII had on U.S. technological advancements. However, its effect on U.S. ‘‘managerial technology’’ innovations has been largely ignored, except for very few qualitative works. In this paper, I argue that ‘‘managerial technology’’ played a key role in shaping U.S. WWII production and its capacity to defeat some of the most advanced economies in the world. The large-scale diffusion of innovative management practices to US firms involved in war production acted as a technology that put them on a higher growth path for decades. Moreover, it made U.S. managerial practices internationally distinctive and helped create the so-called “American Way” of business, which was exported to war-torn European and Japanese economies in the war aftermath.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31980,31980,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Infrastructure Inequality: Who Pays the Cost of Road Roughness?,"Lindsey Currier, Edward L. Glaeser, Gabriel E. Kreindler","Which Americans experience the worst infrastructure? What are the costs of living with that infrastructure? We measure road roughness throughout America using vertical acceleration data from Uber rides across millions of American roads. Our measure correlates strongly and positively with other measures of road roughness where they are available, negatively with driver speed, and we find road repair events decrease roughness and increase speeds. We measure drivers’ willingness-to-pay to avoid roughness by measuring how speeds change with salient changes in road roughness, such as those associated with town borders and road repaving events in Chicago.  These estimates suggest the roughness of the median local road in the US generates welfare losses to drivers of at least 31 cents per driver-mile. Roads are worse near coasts, and in poorer towns and in poorer neighborhoods, even within towns. We find that a household that drives 3,000 miles annually on predominantly local roads will suffer $318 per year more in driving pain if they live in a predominantly Black neighborhood than in a predominantly White neighborhood. Road roughness modestly predicts subsequent road resurfacing in New York City, but not in three other cities, which suggests that repaving is only weakly targeted towards damaged roads. Surveys from 120 towns and cities across the US suggest many reasons why resurfacing seems to be weakly targeted.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31981,31981,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Dealing with Imperfect Randomization: Inference for the HighScope Perry Preschool Program,"James J. Heckman, Rodrigo Pinto, Azeem Shaikh","This paper considers the problem of making inferences about the effects of a program on multiple outcomes when the assignment of treatment status is imperfectly randomized. By imperfect randomization we mean that treatment status is reassigned after an initial randomization on the basis of characteristics that may be observed or unobserved by the analyst. We develop a partial identification approach to this problem that makes use of information limiting the extent to which randomization is imperfect to show that it is still possible to make nontrivial inferences about the effects of the program in such settings. We consider a family of null hypotheses in which each null hypothesis specifies that the program has no effect on one of many outcomes of interest. Under weak assumptions, we construct a procedure for testing this family of null hypotheses in a way that controls the familywise error rate--the probability of even one false rejection--in finite samples. We develop our methodology in the context of a reanalysis of the HighScope Perry Preschool program. We find statistically significant effects of the program on a number of different outcomes of interest, including outcomes related to criminal activity for males and females, even after accounting for imperfections in the randomization and the multiplicity of null hypotheses.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31982,31982,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
The Direct and Intergenerational Effects of Criminal History-Based Safety Net Bans in the U.S.,"Michael G. Mueller-Smith, James M. Reeves, Kevin Schnepel, Caroline Walker","We study the lifetime banning, as introduced by United States Public Law 104-193, of individuals convicted of felony drug offenses after August 22, 1996 from ever receiving future SNAP benefits. Using a regression discontinuity design that leverages CJARS criminal history records with federal administrative and survey data, we estimate the causal impact of safety net assistance bans, finding significant reductions in SNAP benefit take-up, which creates unintentional spillovers to spouses and children and persist long after ban revocations occurred. While we observe limited changes to other adult outcomes, children's cognitive and educational outcomes worsen, especially those impacted at young ages.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31983,31983,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Online Job Posts Contain Very Little Wage Information,"Honey Batra, Amanda Michaud, Simon Mongey","We present six facts that characterize the little wage information contained in the universe of online job posts in the U.S. First, wage information is rare: only 14% of posts contain any wage information and the minority of these (6%) have a point wage. The majority (8%) feature a range of wages that are on average wide, spanning 28% of the midpoint (e.g. $21-28/hr or $32,000$42,000/yr). Second, information varies systematically along the occupation-wage gradient. Third, posted wages are 40% higher than wages in BLS data in low-wage occupations and 20% lower than BLS data in high-wage occupations. Fourth, among the wages that are posted, high wage firms are more opaque, with more and wider ranges. Fifth, there is zero correlation between wage information and local labor market tightness. Sixth, of the top 20 posting private firms, none have any wage information in more than 2% of their posts. Our findings caution against treating wage data from job postings as a stand-in for administrative data. We provide an example of bias in econometric inference that worsens as wage information falls.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31984,31984,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Professional Motivations in the Public Sector: Evidence from Police Officers,"Aaron Chalfin, Felipe M. Gonçalves","We study how public sector workers balance their professional motivations with private economic concerns, focusing on police arrests. Arrests made near the end of an officer's shift typically require overtime work, and officers respond by reducing arrest frequency but increasing arrest quality. Days in which an officer works a second job after their police shift have higher opportunity cost, also reducing late-shift arrests. Combining our estimates in a dynamic model identifies officer preferences over workplace activity and overtime work. Our results indicate that officers' private costs of arrests have a first-order impact on the quantity and quality of enforcement.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31985,31985,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Fund Flows and Income Risk of Fund Managers,"Xiao Cen, Winston Wei Dou, Leonid Kogan, Wei Wu","Investment fund managers make asset allocation decisions on behalf of a significant segment of US households. To elucidate the incentives they operate under, as well as the income and career risks they face, we construct a unique and novel dataset, which encompasses detailed information on the compensation and career trajectories of managers within US active equity mutual funds. The dataset is the first-ever to contain such information, having been compiled based on the US Census Bureau's LEHD program and leveraging various “big” textual data sources. Our causal evidence indicates that, contrary to fund disclosures, managers' pay is primarily driven by Assets Under Management (AUM), with performance influencing compensation only via AUM. Fund flows, although they do not align with client interests, have a significant 6% positive impact on compensation for every one-standard-deviation increase. Systematic flow components impact base salaries, while idiosyncratic elements alter bonuses. Crucially, fund flows, as opposed to fund performance, exert a strong impact on the career outcomes of fund managers, especially concerning their downside career risk. Specifically, large fund outflows elevate a manager's likelihood of job turnover (with a substantial decline in income) by 4 percentage points.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31986,31986,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Market Design for the Environment,"Estelle Cantillon, Aurélie Slechten","The main argument in favor of markets in environmental contexts is the same as in other contexts: their ability to promote efficient allocations and production. But environmental problems bring their own challenges: their underlying bio-physical processes - and the technologies to monitor them - constrain what is feasible or even desirable. This chapter illustrates the main design dimensions in environmental markets, the trade-offs involved and their impact on performance, through the lens of a regulated market for pollution rights (the EU emissions trading scheme) and a voluntary market for the provision of environmental services (the global market for carbon credits). While both markets eventually contribute to climate change mitigation, their organisation as a “pollution market”, for the former, and as a “provision market”, for second, means that different design considerations take precedence. Both markets also face challenges: volatile prices in the EU emissions scheme and low trust for voluntary carbon markets. We discuss how alternative design options could address those.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31987,31987,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Labor Market Tightness and Union Activity,"Chantal Pezold, Simon Jäger, Patrick Nüss","We study how labor market conditions affect unionization decisions. Tight labor markets might spur unionization, e.g., by reducing the threat of unemployment after management opposition or employer retaliation in response to a unionization attempt. Tightness might also weaken unionization by providing attractive outside alternatives to engaging in costly unionization. Drawing on a large-scale, representative survey experiment among U.S. workers, we show that an increase in worker beliefs about labor market tightness moderately raises support for union activity. Effect sizes are small as they imply that moving from trough to peak of the business cycle increases workers’ probability of voting for a union by one percentage point. To study equilibrium effects, we draw on three quasi-experimental research designs using data from across U.S. states and counties over several decades. We find no systematic effect of changes in aggregate labor market tightness on union membership, union elections, and strikes. Overall, our results challenge the notion that labor market tightness significantly drives U.S. unionization.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31988,31988,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
The Role of Intermediaries in Selection Markets: Evidence form Mortgage Lending,"Jason Allen, Robert Clark, Jean-François Houde, Shaoteng Li, Anna V. Trubnikova","We study the role of brokers in selection markets. We find broker-clients in the Canadian mortgage market are observationally different from branch-clients. They finance larger loans with more leverage and longer amortization. We build and estimate a model of mortgage demand to disentangle three possible explanations for these riskier product choices: (i) selection on observables, (ii) unobserved borrower preferences for riskier loans, and (iii) a causal effect of brokers. Although we find that brokers influence product choices, the main reason borrowers choose high-leverage products is unobserved preferences. Borrowers prefer larger loans and brokers facilitate qualification for them.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31989,31989,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Do Cities Mitigate or Exacerbate Environmental Damages to Health?,"David Molitor, Corey D. White","Do environmental conditions pose greater health risks to individuals living in urban or rural areas? The answer is theoretically ambiguous: while urban areas have traditionally been associated with heightened exposure to environmental pollutants, the economies of scale and density inherent to urban environments offer unique opportunities for mitigating or adapting to these harmful exposures. To make progress on this question, we focus on the United States and consider how exposures—to air pollution, drinking water pollution, and extreme temperatures—and the response to those exposures differ across urban and rural settings. While prior studies have addressed some aspects of these issues, substantial gaps in knowledge remain, in large part due to historical deficiencies in monitoring and reporting, especially in rural areas. As a step toward closing these gaps, we present new evidence on urban-rural differences in air quality and population sensitivity to air pollution, leveraging recent advances in remote sensing measurement and machine learning. We find that the urban-rural gap in fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) has converged over the last two decades and the remaining gap is small relative to the overall declines. Furthermore, we find that residents of urban counties are, on average, less vulnerable to the mortality effects of PM₂.₅ exposure. We also discuss promising areas for future research.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31990,31990,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
How Rules and Compliance Impact Organizational Outcomes: Evidence from Delegation in Environmental Regulation,"James Fenske, Muhammad Haseeb, Namrata Kala","Formal rules within organizations are pervasive, but may be interpreted and implemented differently by actors within the organization, impacting organizational outcomes. We consider a delegation reform that changed formal rules within the environmental regulator in an Indian state, by giving decision rights to junior officers over certain types of application. Using novel data on firms' environmental permit applications and internal communications within the regulator, we study how the delegation of formal authority affects its actual allocation, the consequences for applicant firms, and the circumstances that lead senior officers to withhold this authority. The change in decision rights led to greater approval rates for applicant firms. However, only two thirds of applications that should have been delegated according to the rules were actually delegated. We show that senior officers chose to retain decision rights over more difficult applications, namely, applications with higher pollution potential. Furthermore, baseline disagreement with more subordinates' recommendations reduces delegation post-reform, and officers facing a higher backlog of applications are more likely to delegate. These results are consistent with a framework where the allocation of decision rights is determined by a knowledge hierarchy and where different senior officers face varying costs of delegation at different times.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31991,31991,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Designing a Presumptive Income Tax Based on Turnover in Countries with Large Informal Sectors,"Feng Wei, Jean-François Wen","Turnover (sales) is frequently used in developing countries as a presumptive income tax base, to economize on the costs of tax administration and taxpayer compliance. We construct a simple model where a size threshold separates firms paying turnover tax from those paying profit tax (regular income tax), and where firms have the option of producing in the untaxed, informal sector. The optimal turnover tax rate trades off two policy concerns: reducing informality and avoiding strategic reductions in sales by firms seeking to remain below the threshold for the profit tax. We provide analytical results and calibrate the model to compute the optimal policy using realistic parameter values. The optimal turnover tax rate for countries with large informal sectors is found to be around 2.5% across most scenarios, while the threshold separating the turnover tax regime from profit tax lies for the most part between $65,000 and $95,000. Introducing an optimally designed turnover tax reduces the rate of informality of businesses by about 12 percentage points in the calibrated model.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/22/Designing-a-Presumptive-Income-Tax-Based-on-Turnover-in-Countries-with-Large-Informal-542831,WPIEA2023267,"Fri, 22 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/28/2023
The Intergenerational Health Effects of Forced Displacement: Japanese American Incarceration during WWII,"Daniel S. Grossman, Umair Khalil, Laura Panza","We study the intergenerational health consequences of  forced displacement and incarceration of Japanese Americans in the US during WWII. Incarcerated mothers had babies who were less healthy at birth. This decrease in health represents a shift in the entire birthweight distribution due to exposure to prison camps. Imprisoned individuals were less likely to have children with fathers of other ethnic groups but were more likely to receive prenatal care, invest in education, and participate in the labor market. To the extent human capital effects mitigate the full negative effects of incarceration on intergenerational health, our results are a lower bound.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31992,31992,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Long-run Impacts of Forced Labor Migration on Fertility Behaviors: Evidence from Colonial West Africa,"Pascaline Dupas, Camille Falezan, Marie Christelle Mabeu, Pauline Rossi","Is the persistently high fertility in West Africa today rooted in the decades of forced labor migration under colonial rule? We study the case of Burkina Faso, considered the largest labor reservoir in West Africa by the French colonial authorities. Hundreds of thousands of young men were forcibly recruited and sent to work in neighboring colonies for multiple years. The practice started in the late 1910s and lasted until the late 1940s, when forced labor was replaced with voluntary wage employment. We digitize historical maps, combine data from multiple surveys, and exploit the historical, temporary partition of colonial Burkina Faso (and, more specifically, the historical land of the Mossi ethnic group) into three zones with different needs for labor to implement a spatial regression discontinuity design analysis. We find that, on the side where Mossi villages were more exposed to forced labor historically, there is more temporary male migration to Côte d'Ivoire up to today, and lower realized and desired fertility today. We show evidence suggesting that the inherited pattern of low-skill circular migration for adult men reduced the reliance on subsistence farming and the accompanying need for child labor. We can rule out women's empowerment or improvements in human and physical capital as pathways for the fertility decline. These findings contribute to the debate on the origins of family institutions and preferences, often mentioned to explain West Africa's exceptional fertility trends, showing that fertility choices respond to changes in modes of production.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31993,31993,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
"School Management Takeover, Leadership Change, and Personnel Policy","Emma Duchini, Victor Lavy, Stephen Machin, Shqiponja Telhaj","Low-performing, high-poverty, public schools notoriously struggle to attract and retain good teachers. This paper studies a setting where independent organizations, including charities and businesses, take over the management of under-performing schools, while funding remains public. Exploiting the staggered expansion of English Sponsor-led academies since the early 2000s, we show that the Sponsor-led takeover leads to substantial changes in the teaching body and the school personnel policy. The probability that the Sponsor appoints a new headteacher doubles upon the takeover, with the new headteacher being, on average, better paid, and more likely to come from outstanding schools. The takeover also induces teacher sorting, with older and lower-achieving teachers leaving the school, and new teachers joining the Sponsor-led school from outstanding schools. Lastly, Sponsors substantially restructure teachers’ rewarding scheme and abandon a pay scale entirely based on seniority, leading to a 10 percent increase in pay dispersion across equally experienced teachers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31994,31994,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
"The 2010 Census Confidentiality Protections Failed, Here's How and Why","John M. Abowd, Tamara Adams, Robert Ashmead, David Darais, Sourya Dey, Simson L. Garfinkel, Nathan Goldschlag, Daniel Kifer, Philip Leclerc, Ethan Lew, Scott Moore, Rolando A. Rodríguez, Ramy N. Tadros, Lars Vilhuber","Using only 34 published tables, we reconstruct five variables (census block, sex, age, race, and ethnicity) in the confidential 2010 Census person records. Using the 38-bin age variable tabulated at the census block level, at most 20.1% of reconstructed records can differ from their confidential source on even a single value for these five variables. Using only published data, an attacker can verify that all records in 70% of all census blocks (97 million people) are perfectly reconstructed. The tabular publications in Summary File 1 thus have prohibited disclosure risk similar to the unreleased confidential microdata. Reidentification studies confirm that an attacker can, within blocks with perfect reconstruction accuracy, correctly infer the actual census response on race and ethnicity for 3.4 million vulnerable population uniques (persons with nonmodal characteristics) with 95% accuracy, the same precision as the confidential data achieve and far greater than statistical baselines. The flaw in the 2010 Census framework was the assumption that aggregation prevented accurate microdata reconstruction, justifying weaker disclosure limitation methods than were applied to 2010 Census public microdata. The framework used for 2020 Census publications defends against attacks that are based on reconstruction, as we also demonstrate here. Finally, we show that alternatives to the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System with similar accuracy (enhanced swapping) also fail to protect confidentiality, and those that partially defend against reconstruction attacks (incomplete suppression implementations) destroy the primary statutory use case: data for redistricting all legislatures in the country in compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31995,31995,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023

Divided We Fall: Differential Exposure to Geopolitical Fragmentation in Trade,"Shushanik Hakobyan, Sergii Meleshchuk, Robert Zymek","This paper assesses differences in countries’ macroeconomic exposure to trade fragmentation along geopolitical lines. Estimating structural gravity regressions for sector-level bilateral trade flows between 185 countries, we find that differences in individual countries’ geopolitical ties act as a barrier to trade, with the largest effects concentrated in a few sectors (notably, food and high-end manufacturing). Consequently, countries’ exposure via trade to geopolitical shifts varies with their market size, comparative advantage, and foreign policy alignments. Introducing our estimates into a dynamic many-country, many-sector quantitative trade model, we show that geoeconomic fragmentation—modelled as an increased sensitivity of trade costs to geopolitics and greater geopolitical polarization—generally leads to lower trade and incomes. However, emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) tend to see the largest impacts: real per-capita income losses for the median EMDE in Asia are 80 percent larger, and for the median EMDE in Africa 120 percent larger, than for the median advanced economy. This suggests that the costs of trade fragmentation could fall disproportionally on countries that can afford it the least.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/22/Divided-We-Fall-Differential-Exposure-to-Geopolitical-Fragmentation-in-Trade-542842,WPIEA2023270,"Fri, 22 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/28/2023
"Emigration, Business Dynamics, and Firm Heterogeneity in North Macedonia","Ninghui Li, Thomas Pihl Gade","High emigration rates are a challenge in the Western Balkans. High emigration rates might lead to inadequate skilled labor and affect firm creation, capital formation, and economic convergence. The 2021 North Macedonia census reveals that more than 12.4% of North Macedonians live abroad. To assess the consequences, we estimate the impact of emigration on the number of firms and capital formation. Business dynamics can affect emigration reversely. To alleviate the endogeneity bias, we use a shift-share instrument with the historical diaspora networks and destination countries’ GDP growth rate as a source of exogenous variations. Our results show that (1) In the short run, a 1 percentage point increase in the emigration rate leads to a 2.91% decrease in the number of firms in the area of origin; (2) The long-run effects of emigration on the number of firms are less negative than the short-run impacts; (3) Emigration mainly reduces the number of micro and small firms; (4) Emigration affects the number of firms and capital formation more in the industrial sector than the other sectors, through the skilled labor shortage channel.

Flattening the Curve and the Flight of the Rich: Pandemic-Induced Shifts in US and European Housing Markets,"Nina Biljanovska, Giovanni Dell'Ariccia","The pattern of increasing suburban house prices relative to urban centers initiated during the pandemic continues to hold across the top 30 US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). In contrast, European countries such as Denmark, France, and the United Kingdom did not experience a similar shift in valuations. We posit and find supporting evidence that these divergent patterns partially due to differences in the characteristics of suburban areas, particularly in terms of household income and property sizes; with European suburbs being relatively poorer and characterized by smaller housing units. We show that, in the US, MSAs with suburban features more akin to those in European cities generally experienced little to no increase in suburban housing prices compared to their urban centers.

Non-traded Gains From Trade - Selection in the Non-Traded Sector: Evidence from Brazil,"Rafael Machado Parente, Rowan Shi","We investigate how trade shocks affect the allocation of labor across plants at the local labor market level. Using Brazil’s import liberalization as a quasi-natural experiment, we uncover a new margin for the gains from trade: the reallocation of labor from smaller to larger producers in the non-traded sector. We find that in response to liberalization, larger non-traded producers self-select into importing, expanding as they gain access to inputs from abroad. We then develop a parsimonious model of heterogeneous producers incorporating this mechanism. The theory is consistent with the empirical findings and show that reallocation among non-traded producers is welfare-enhancing. In contrast, this reallocation effect disappears when all nontraded producers make the same importing decision.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/22/Non-traded-Gains-From-Trade-Selection-in-the-Non-Traded-Sector-Evidence-from-Brazil-542411,WPIEA2023265,"Fri, 22 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/28/2023
Can Supply Shocks Be Inflationary with a Flat Phillips Curve?,"Jean-Paul L’Huillier, Gregory Phelan","Not in standard models. With conventional pricing frictions, imposing a flat Phillips curve also imposes a price level that is rigid with respect to supply shocks. In the New Keynesian model, price markup shocks need to be several orders of magnitude bigger than other shocks in order to fit the data, leading to unreasonable assessments of the magnitude of the increase in costs during inflationary episodes. To account for the facts, we propose a strategic microfoundation of shock-dependent price stickiness: prices are sticky with respect to demand shocks but flexible with respect to supply shocks. This friction is demand-intrinsic, in line with narrative accounts for the imperfect adjustment of prices. Firms can credibly justify a price increase due to a rise in costs, whereas it is harder to do so when demand increases. Inflation from supply shocks is efficient and does not justify a monetary policy response.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2336-can-supply-shocks-be-inflationary-with-flat-phillips-curve,23-36,12.28.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,12/31/2023
"A Field Guide to Monetary Policy Implementation Issues in a New World with CBDC, Stablecoin, and Narrow Banks",James A. Clouse,"This paper develops an analytical framework aimed at shedding light on the implications of the evolution of financial market structure for monetary policy implementation and transmission. The basic model builds on that developed in Chen et. al. (2014) which, in turn, draws inspiration from the pioneering work of Tobin (1969) and Gurley and Shaw (1960). The paper focuses, in particular, on the implications of introducing new types of fixed-rate financial assets in the financial system including retail and wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), stablecoins issued by narrow nonbanks, and deposits issued by narrow banks. The analysis also provides a crude way of capturing some of the effects of bank capital and liquidity regulation on financial intermediation and monetary policy implementation. Perhaps the most important conclusion is that the introduction of new fixed-rate assets by the Federal Reserve or by other financial intermediaries can have significant effects on equilibrium interest rates and patterns of financial intermediation and may also affect the potency of monetary policy tools. These effects are most pronounced when new financial assets are close substitutes for existing financial assets.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/a-field-guide-to-monetary-policy-implementation-issues-in-a-new-world-with-cbdc-stablecoin-and-narrow-banks.htm,2024-001,24-Jan,FED-BOARD,1/1/2024
Government-Sponsored Mortgage Securitization and Financial Crises,Wayne Passmore and Roger Sparks,"This paper analyzes a model of the mortgage market, considering scenarios with and without government-sponsored mortgage securitization. Conventional wisdom says that securitization, by fostering diversification and creating a “safe” asset in the form of mortgage-backed security (MBS), will reduce risk and enhance liquidity, thereby mitigating financial crises. We construct a strategic-game framework to model the interaction between the securitizer and banks. In this framework, the securitizer initiates the process by setting the MBS contract terms, which includes the guaranteed rate and the criterion that qualifies a mortgage for securitization. The bank then selects which qualifying mortgages to exchange for the MBS. Our investigation leads to a key result: government-sponsored securitization, somewhat counterintuitively, is more likely to exacerbate the severity and frequency of financial crises.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/government-sponsored-mortgage-securitization-and-financial-crises.htm,2024-002,24-Jan,FED-BOARD,1/1/2024
Monopsony Amplifies Distortions from Progressive Taxes,"David W. Berger, Kyle F. Herkenhoff, Simon Mongey, Negin Mousavi","In this short paper we show that progressive income taxes distort hiring and wages when firms have labor market power. From a firm’s perspective, raising pre-tax wages increases employment by less when taxes are progressive as less of the pre-tax wage is paid to workers. Understanding this when setting wages leads to lower wages and employment at all firms. When firms differ in productivity, progressive taxes also distort the allocation of labor across firms. We characterize this novel monopsony cost of progressivity in a simple monopsony economy and derive efficiency wedges that depend on progressivity. A simple quantification of these wedges points to the possibility that the monopsony cost may be of similar magnitudes to redistribution and insurance benefits.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31972,31972,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Lifetime Memories of Inflation: Evidence from Surveys and the Lab,"Isabelle Salle, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Olivier Coibion","We study how individuals’ memories of inflation shape their expectations about future inflation using both surveys and laboratory experiments. Recalling having lived through prior disinflations has pronounced effects on how long-lived people expect the current inflation episode to last. Information treatments in which we show people prior disinflationary experiences similarly strongly reduce inflation expectations of individuals on average and are often recalled as inflation memories months later. We also show that when people try to forecast inflation in the lab, the inflation dynamics in the game can affect their beliefs much like the inflation experienced in real life. Methodologically, we compare and contrast surveys and lab experiments and discuss the pros and cons of each method, emphasizing the general consistency across the two methodologies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31996,31996,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Girls’ Night In? Effects of the Kenyan COVID-19 Lockdown on Web Browsing,"Soledad Giardili, Sanjay Jain, Amalia R. Miller, Kamalini Ramdas, Alp Sungu","We present the first objective evidence on how COVID-19 lockdowns affected internet browser usage in Africa, using detailed digital trace data on PC-based and mobile-based browsing patterns of 316 Kenyans who had access to a PC, covering the period before and during Kenya’s first national COVID-19 curfew that was declared on March 25, 2020. We find that total daily browser usage increased by 41 minutes, or 15 percent of average browsing time, after the curfew started. We find no significant differences in total browsing time during the curfew by gender or by residence in high-speed vs. low-speed broadband access areas. However, we do find gender differences in the content of browsing. Women’s time on YouTube and Netflix exceeded men’s from the start of our sample period, and the gender gap in Netflix browsing increased by 36 minutes daily, corresponding to almost twice the average daily Netflix time in the sample. Men’s browsing became less concentrated during the curfew, across both domains and topics, but women’s did not. The degree of overlap in browsing between men and women also increased, likely due to men visiting sites that were previously exclusively visited by women. Across the entire sample, browsing of Kenyan domains dropped significantly relative to that of non-Kenyan domains, indicating greater reliance on international content during this period of economic and social upheaval.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31997,31997,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Customer Discrimination in the Workplace: Evidence from Online Sales,"Erin M. Kelley, Gregory V. Lane, Matthew Pecenco, Edward A. Rubin","Many workers are evaluated on their ability to engage with customers. We measure the impact of gender-based customer discrimination on the productivity of online sales agents in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using a novel framework that randomly varies the gender of names presented to customers without changing worker behavior, we find the assignment of a female-sounding name leads to 50 percent fewer purchases. Customers also lag in responding, are less expressive, and avoid discussing purchases. We show similar results for customers around the world and across workers. Removing customer bias, we find women would be more productive than their male co-workers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31998,31998,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Population and Welfare: The Greatest Good for the Greatest Number,"Mohamad Adhami, Mark Bils, Charles I. Jones, Peter J. Klenow","Economic growth is typically measured in per capita terms. But social welfare should arguably include the number of people as well as their standard of living. We decompose social welfare growth — measured in consumption-equivalent (CE) units — into contributions from rising population and rising per capita consumption. Because of diminishing marginal utility from consumption, population growth is scaled up by a value-of-life factor that exceeds one and empirically averages nearly 3 across countries since 1960. Population increases are therefore a major contributor, and CE welfare growth around the world averages more than 6% per year since 1960 as opposed to 2% per year for consumption growth. Countries such as Mexico and South Africa rise sharply in the growth rankings, whereas China, Germany, and Japan plummet. These results are robust to incorporating time use and fertility decisions using data from the U.S., Mexico, the Netherlands, Japan, South Africa, and South Korea. Falling parental utility from having fewer kids is roughly offset by increases in the “quality” of kids associated with rising time investment per child.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31999,31999,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
An IV Hazard Model of Loan Default with an Application to Subprime Mortgage Cohorts,Christopher Palmer,"This paper develops a control-function methodology accounting for endogenous or mismeasured regressors in hazard models. I provide sufficient identifying assumptions and regularity conditions for the estimator to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Applying my estimator to the subprime mortgage crisis, I quantify what caused the foreclosure rate to triple across the 2003-2007 subprime cohorts. To identify the elasticity of default with respect to housing prices, I use various home-price instruments including historical variation in home-price cyclicality. Loose credit played a significant role in the crisis, but much of the increase in defaults across cohorts was caused by home-price declines unrelated to lending standards, with a 10% decline in home prices increasing subprime mortgage default rates by 50%.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32000,32000,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Asset Demand of U.S. Households,"Xavier Gabaix, Ralph S. J. Koijen, Federico Mainardi, Sangmin Oh, Motohiro Yogo","We use novel monthly security-level data on U.S. household portfolio holdings, flows, and returns to analyze asset demand across an extensive range of asset classes, including both public and private assets. Our dataset covers a broad range of households across the wealth distribution, notably including 439 billionaires. This ensures representation of ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) households that are typically not well covered in survey data. With these data, we study the portfolio rebalancing behavior of households and ask whether (and, if so, which) households play an important stabilizing role in financial markets. Our findings reveal a stark contrast: less affluent households sell U.S. equities amid market downturns, while UHNW households buy and contribute to stabilizing markets. This behavior is more pronounced among households who rebalance their portfolios more frequently. However, the sensitivity of flows to returns is generally quite small and as the trades of different wealth groups partly offset each other, the aggregate household sector plays a limited role to absorb financial fluctuations. To understand the contrasting trading behavior across households, we show that a household’s flows to U.S. equities are negatively correlated with its “active returns” (the difference between an investor’s return and the market return). However, the flows to U.S. equities of less affluent households are also positively correlated with broad market returns – perhaps due to shifts in risk aversion, sentiment, or perceived macroeconomic risk – leading this group of households to act pro-cyclically. Across all asset classes, three factors with intuitive economic interpretations explain 81% of all variation in portfolio rebalancing. Those factors bet on the long-term equity premium, the credit premium, and the premium on municipal bonds. In sum, our framework paints a quantitative picture of U.S. households’ assets and rebalancing marked by a great deal of insensitivity and inertia throughout the distribution, even for UHNW households. These new facts are useful for the calibration of macro-finance models with heterogeneous households and multiple risky asset classes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32001,32001,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Organized Crime and Economic Growth: Evidence from Municipalities Infiltrated by the Mafia,"Alessandra Fenizia, Raffaele Saggio","This paper studies the long-run economic impact of dismissing city councils infiltrated by organized crime. Applying a matched difference-in-differences design to the universe of Italian social security records, we find that city council dismissals (CCDs) increase employment, the number of firms, and industrial real estate prices. The effects are concentrated in Mafia-dominated sectors and in municipalities where fewer incumbents are re-elected. The dismissals generate large economic returns by weakening the Mafia and fostering trust in local institutions. The analysis suggests that CCDs represent an effective intervention for establishing legitimacy and spurring economic activity in areas dominated by organized crime.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32002,32002,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Valuing Technology Complementarities: Rooftop Solar and Energy Storage,"Bryan Bollinger, Naim Darghouth, Kenneth Gillingham, Andres Gonzalez-Lira","Product complementarities can shape market patterns, influencing the demand for related products and their accessories. This study examines complementarities in the demand for rooftop solar and an accessory, battery energy storage. Using nationwide administrative data, we estimate a dynamic nested-logit model of solar and storage adoption. We quantify the demand complementarity between solar and storage, and find that if storage was not available, 20% of households who coadopt solar and storage would not adopt anything. We find that the demand for solar and storage bundles increases with power outages, with a larger effect in California.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32003,32003,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Migration Policy and the Supply of Foreign Physicians: Evidence from the Conrad 30 Waiver Program,"Breno Braga, Gaurav Khanna, Sarah Turner","In the United States, rural and low-income communities have difficulty attracting and retaining physicians, potentially adversely impacting health outcomes. With a limited supply of physicians completing medical school at US universities, foreign-born and educated physicians provide a potential source of supply in underserved areas. For international medical school graduates (IMGs) the terms of the commonly used J-1 visa require a return to the home country for two years following employment in medical residency.  Our analysis examines the extent to which the Conrad 30 Visa Waiver impacts the supply of physicians at state and local levels, particularly in areas designated as medically underserved. Changes in the federal limit on the number of waivers per state, combined with variation in the state-level restrictions on eligible specialties, and geographies in which physicians can work, provide evidence on the role of visa restrictions in limiting the supply of doctors. Expansion of the cap on visa waivers increased the supply of IMGs, particularly in states that did not limit waiver recipients to primary care physicians or particular places of employment. There is little evidence of reductions in US-trained doctors in states where IMG increases were the largest, suggesting little evidence for crowding out.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32005,32005,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
"Wellbeing, Expectations and Unemployment in Europe","David G. Blanchflower, Alex Bryson","We find expectations are more sensitive to economic growth than traditional wellbeing metrics. We examine Eurobarometer micro data from 1973-2023 on movements in life satisfaction along with data from 1995-2022 on five expectations variables on and individual’s life and their financial and job situations plus their views on the economic and employment situation of their country in the year ahead.  These expectations start to decline several months before the onset of downturns with especially large drops for the Great Recession and Covid.  Annual GDP growth is positively associated with these expectations variables while it is uncorrelated with life satisfaction.  The unemployment rate and the CPI reduce both.  We analyze data for 29 European countries to predict changes in the unemployment rate 12 months ahead using individuals’ fears of unemployment in the presence of country and year fixed effects and lagged unemployment.  We also use firms' expectations of future employment, which are also predictive of what happens to unemployment three months later.  Using our preferred model specification, we present out-of-sample predictions that track actual movements in unemployment rates closely over a period in which there were two major recessions and unemployment shifted by a factor of two.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32006,32006,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
The Informational Centrality of Banks,"Nathan Foley-Fisher, Gary B.

The amount of this information varies over time and over equity and debt. During a financial crisis banks are, by definition of a crisis, at risk of failure. Debt prices became about 50 percent more informative than equity prices about the future state of the banking system during the financial crisis of 2007-2009.

What Drives the Exchange Rate?,"Oleg Itskhoki, Dmitry Mukhin","We use a general open-economy wedge-accounting framework to characterize the set of shocks that can account for major exchange rate puzzles. Focusing on a near-autarky behavior of the economy, we show analytically that all standard macroeconomic shocks — including productivity, monetary, government spending, and markup shocks — are inconsistent with the broad properties of the macro exchange rate disconnect. News shocks about future macroeconomic fundamentals can generate plausible exchange rate properties. However, they show up prominently in contemporaneous asset prices, which violates the finance exchange rate disconnect. International shocks to trade costs, terms of trade and import demand, while potentially consistent with disconnect, do not robustly generate the empirical Backus-Smith, UIP and terms-of-trade properties. In contrast, the observed exchange rate behavior is consistent with risk-sharing (financial) shocks that arise from shifts in demand of foreign investors for home-currency assets, or vice versa.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32008,32008,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Financial Integration and Monetary Policy Coordination,"Javier Bianchi, Louphou Coulibaly","Financial integration generates macroeconomic spillovers that may require international monetary policy coordination.

We identify three sufficient statistics that determine whether the Nash equilibrium exhibits under-tightening or over-tightening: the output gap, sectoral differences in labor intensity, and the trade balance response to changes in nominal rates. Independently of the shocks hitting the economy, we find that under-tightening is possible during economic expansions or contractions.

"Innovation Booms, Easy Financing, and Human Capital Accumulation","Johan Hombert, Adrien Matray","Innovation booms are often fueled by easy financing that allows new technology firms to pay high wages that attracts skilled labor. Using the late 1990s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) boom as a laboratory, we show that skilled labor joining this new sector experienced sizeable long-term earnings losses. We show these earnings patterns are explained by faster skill obsolescence rather than either worker selection or the overall bust in the ICT sector. During the boom, financing flowed more to firms whose workers would experience the largest productivity declines, amplifying the negative effect of labor reallocation on aggregate human capital accumulation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32012,32012,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
The Effects of Interest Rate Increases on Consumers' Inflation Expectations: The Roles of Informedness and Compliance,"Edward S. Knotek II, James Mitchell, Mathieu Pedemonte, Taylor Shiroff","We study how monetary policy communications associated with increasing the federal funds rate causally affect consumers' inflation expectations. In a large-scale, multi-wave randomized controlled trial (RCT), we find weak evidence on average that communicating policy changes lowers consumers' medium-term inflation expectations. However, information differs systematically across demographic groups, in terms of ex ante informedness about monetary policy and ex post compliance with the information treatment. Monetary policy communications have a much stronger effect on people who had not previously heard news about monetary policy and who take sufficient time to read the treatment, implying scope to increase the impact of communications by targeting specific groups of the general public. Our findings show that, in an inflationary environment, consumers expect that raising interest rates will lower inflation. More generally, our results emphasize the importance of measuring both respondents' information sets and their compliance with treatment when using RCTs in empirical macroeconomics, to better understand the well-documented evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2401-consumers-inflation-expectations,24-01,01.03.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,1/3/2024

The Effect of Component Disaggregation on Measures of the Median and Trimmed-Mean CPI,"Christian Garciga, Randal J. Verbrugge, Saeed Zaman","For decades, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC) has produced median and trimmed-mean consumer price index (CPI) measures. These have proven useful in various contexts, such as forecasting and understanding post-COVID inflation dynamics. Revisions to the FRBC methodology have historically involved increasing the level of disaggregation in the CPI components, which has improved accuracy. Thus, it may seem logical that further disaggregation would continue to enhance its accuracy. However, we theoretically demonstrate that this may not necessarily be the case. We then explore the empirical impact of further disaggregation along two dimensions: shelter and non-shelter components. We find that significantly increasing the disaggregation in the shelter indexes, when combined with only a slight increase in non-shelter disaggregation, improves the ability of the median and trimmed-mean CPI to track the medium-term trend in CPI inflation and marginally increases predictive power over future movements in CPI inflation. Finally, we examine the practical implications of our preferred degree of disaggregation. Our preferred measure of the median CPI suggests that trend inflation was lower pre-pandemic, while both our preferred median and trimmed-mean measures suggest a faster acceleration in trend inflation in 2021. We also find that higher disaggregation marginally weakens the Phillips curve relationship between median CPI inflation and the unemployment gap, though it remains statistically significant.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2402-effect-of-component-disaggregation,24-02,01.04.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,1/4/2024

The Return of Industrial Policy in Data,"Simon Evenett, Adam Jakubik, Fernando Martín, Michele Ruta","This paper introduces the New Industrial Policy Observatory (NIPO) dataset and documents emergent patterns of policy intervention during 2023 associated with the return of industrial policy. The data show that the recent wave of new industrial policy activity is primarily driven by advanced economies, and that subsidies are the most employed instrument. Trade restrictions on imports and exports are more frequently used by emerging market and developing economies. Strategic competitiveness is the dominant motive governments give for these measures, but other objectives such as climate change, resilience and national security are on the rise. In exploratory regressions, we find that implemented measures are correlated with the past use of measures by other governments in the same sector, pointing to the tit-for-tat nature of industrial policy. Furthermore, domestic political economy factors and macroeconomic conditions correlate with the use of industrial policy measures.

Haste or Waste? The Role of Presale in Residential Housing,"Ziyang Chen, Maggie Rong Hu, Ginger Zhe Jin, Qiyao Zhou","This paper provides the first theory and evidence on the role of presale policies in the residential housing market. We start with constructing a novel dataset of unfinished projects, presale policies, and land auction outcomes across 270 major cities in China. We then identify 2,330 unfinished residential projects from 2010 to 2017 on a citizen complaint website run by the central government. We find that both presale criterion and postsale supervision of construction costs relate to a lower probability of unfinished projects. But only presale criterion relates negatively to the pace of new housing development, measured by developers' multitasking and land auction outcomes. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the average bundle of presale policies is inferior to the Pareto frontier in our sampled cities. Tightening the regulation on postsale supervision by 2 standard deviations may lead to a 58% reduction in the occurrence of unfinished projects, while keeping the pace of new housing development unchanged. Eliminating unfinished projects would entail a drastic increase in both presale criterion and postsale supervision, with slower housing development.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32013,32013,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Patient Costs and Physicians' Information,"Michael J.

The effectiveness of these incentives, however, depends both on physicians' price sensitivity and their knowledge of patient prices. We develop a moment inequality model that allows researchers to identify agents' preferences without fully specifying their information. Applying this model to diabetes care, we find that physicians lack detailed price information and are more price-elastic than full-information models imply. We predict that providing physicians detailed information on prices at the point of prescribing can save patients 12-23% of their out-of-pocket costs for diabetes treatment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32014,32014,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Disentangling Various Explanations for the Declining Labor Share: Evidence from Millions of Firm Records,Ann Harrison,"This paper uses millions of records from a cross-country and time series database of both publicly listed and private companies to disentangle the role of technological change, market power, and globalization in driving a fall in the labor share. Labor shares are measured at the enterprise level as the share of total remuneration to workers in value-added. Technological change is measured using research and development expenditures or total factor productivity growth. Market power is measured using four firm and twenty firm concentration ratios and globalization is measured as export shares in total revenues. We also supplement the cross-country evidence with a more in depth look at China using its industrial census. The evidence suggests that between 1995 and 2019 the most important driver of falling labor shares was technological change. Greater market power (measured by firm concentration ratios) also contributed to lower labor shares, but the magnitudes are smaller. Finally, the evidence on globalization is mixed: trade shares are at times negatively associated with the labor share but in the case of China there is a strong positive relationship between exporting and labor shares at the enterprise level.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32015,32015,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
"The Rise of Factor Investing: ""Passive"" Security Design and Market Implications","Lin William Cong, Shiyang Huang, Douglas Xu","We model financial innovations such as Exchange-Traded Funds, smart beta products, and many index-based vehicles as composite securities (CSs) that facilitate trading the common factors in assets' liquidation values. Through accessing a larger basket of assets in endogenously chosen proportions, CSs reduce investors' duplication of effort in trading multiple securities and attract more factor investors. We characterize analytically how competitive CS designers in equilibrium optimally select liquid underlying assets representative of the factors and find corroborating evidence in ETF data. CS trading entails investors' strategic and active decisions, consequently impounding more systematic information into prices. Their rise creates leads to greater informational efficiency, price variability, and co-movements in the underlying asset markets, as well as potentially heterogeneous effects on liquidity and asset-specific information acquisition/incorporation, depending on the importance of factors for asset value. The predictions explain and reconcile the rich (and often mixed) empirical observations about various types of CSs in the extant literature.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32016,32016,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Negative Weights are No Concern in Design-Based Specifications,"Kirill Borusyak, Peter Hull","Recent work shows that popular partially-linear regression specifications can put negative weights on some treatment effects, potentially producing incorrectly-signed estimands. We counter by showing that negative weights are no problem in design-based specifications, in which low-dimensional controls span the conditional expectation of the treatment. Specifically, the estimands of such specifications are convex averages of causal effects with “ex-ante” weights that average the potentially negative “ex-post” weights across possible treatment realizations. This result extends to design-based instrumental variable estimands under a first-stage monotonicity condition, and applies to “formula” treatments and instruments such as shift-share instruments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32017,32017,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
A Delegation Approach to Regulating Hiring Discrimination,"Paolo Martellini, Guido Menzio","We approach the design of anti-discriminatory labor market regulation as a delegation problem. A private firm (the agent) is repeatedly faced with the opportunity of hiring one among several applicants to fill its vacancies. The firm is biased against applicants from some demographic group, and it is neutral towards applicants from some other group. Applicants differ not only with respect to their demographic characteristics, but also with respect to the idiosyncratic quality of their match with firm. A benevolent and unbiased labor market authority (the principal) enacts a hiring regulation (a direct-revelation mechanism without transfers) in order to reduce the impact of the firm's bias on its hiring behavior. The hiring regulation is constrained by the fact that the quality of the match between any particular applicant and the firm is privately observed by the firm. We characterize the optimal mechanism.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32018,32018,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
EXIM’s Exit: The Real Effects of Trade Financing by Export Credit Agencies,"Poorya Kabir, Adrien Matray, Karsten Müller, Chenzi Xu","We study the role of export credit agencies—the predominant tool of industrial policy—on firm behavior by using the effective shutdown of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) from 2015-2019 as a natural experiment. We show that firms that previously relied on EXIM support saw a 18% drop in global sales after the agency closed down, driven by a reduction in exports. Firms affected by the shutdown were unable to make up for the loss of trade financing, especially if they were financially constrained, and consequently laid off employees and curtailed investment. These negative effects were more pronounced for firms with higher export opportunities and higher ex-ante marginal revenue products of capital. Lower exports at the firm level aggregate up to lower total exports for industries most reliant on EXIM support. These findings suggest that government policies aimed at providing trade financing can boost exports and firm growth even in countries with well-developed financial markets without necessarily leading to a misallocation of resources.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32019,32019,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Nonprofits and the Scope of Government: Theory and an Application to the Health Sector,Karen Eggleston,"Nonprofits supply many tax-financed services like healthcare and education. Yet nonprofits are absent from the canonical property rights theory of ownership. Extending the government “make or buy” decision to nonprofits and ex post frictions based on contracts as reference points suggests that contracting out to a nonprofit can be optimal when “mission” alignment credibly signals adherence to the spirit and not just the letter of the contract in unforeseen contingencies. The model sheds light on differential nonprofit presence across the spectrum of basic services, as illustrated by an application to the health sector.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32020,32020,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Variation in State Response to Open Access: Constituent Characteristics,Gary D. Libecap,"Open access, competitive exploitation can be incredibly damaging to valuable resources and the human populations that depend upon them. Even though wealth, resource rents and stocks are at stake, open access often seems to be ineffectively addressed across time and space. Institutions vary. Devising and assigning access and use rights of some type privately or within a group, recognized by the state, is the most straightforward way of confronting the problem.  Alternatively, regulation can be implemented that involves limiting entry, assigning input and related capital controls, restricting exploitation times, and/or setting output restrictions. Across three settings, hard-rock minerals, oil and gas deposits, and fisheries, I outline institutional differences and provide hypotheses as to why they occur.  The open-access problem is described and followed by discussion of the political economy of regulation. Variation in industry structure, resource characteristics and value, as well as heterogeneity of interests in combating open access determine outcomes.   The cases are drawn from the US, but may be representative of general patterns.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32021,32021,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
"Refinancing Frictions, Mortgage Pricing and Redistribution","David W. Berger, Konstantin Milbradt, Fabrice Tourre, Joseph S. Vavra","There are large cross-sectional differences in how often US borrowers refinance mortgages. In this paper, we develop an equilibrium mortgage pricing model with heterogeneous borrowers and use it to show that equilibrium forces imply important cross-subsidies from borrowers who rarely refinance to those who refinance often. Mortgage reforms can potentially reduce these regressive cross-subsidies, but the equilibrium effects of these reforms can also have important distributional consequences. For example, many policies that lead to more frequent refinancing also increase equilibrium mortgage rates and thus reduce residential mortgage credit access for a large number of borrowers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32022,32022,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Energy Hogs and Energy Angels: What Does Residential Electricity Usage Really Tell Us About Profligate Consumption?,Severin Borenstein,"Since the 1970s, high volumetric (per kilowatt-hour) electricity prices have been justified in many policy discussions as encouraging more efficient use of electricity and placing more of the cost burden on those who are less prudent in their use. The argument has been used in support of increasing-block electricity pricing, under which the price per kilowatt-hour rises as a household consumes more electricity per month. More recently, in California, opponents of a proposal to lower volumetric prices and replace the revenue through fixed monthly charges have suggested that the change would just benefit “energy hogs”. In this paper, I first investigate characteristics of households who are high electricity consumers and ask how effectively such pricing targets profligate residential electricity consumption. I then look more broadly at the energy usage individuals are responsible for in the economy, how other energy usage is priced, and the role that residential electricity use plays in the overall picture. Finally, I connect the discussion of profligate direct and indirect energy consumption with the negative externalities produced, which are typically the justification for such penalty pricing.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32023,32023,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Outsourcing Policy and Worker Outcomes: Causal Evidence from a Mexican Ban,"Alejandro Estefan, Roberto Gerhard, Joseph P. Kaboski, Illenin O. Kondo, Wei Qian","A weakening of labor protection policies is often invoked as one cause of observed monopsony power and the decline in labor's share of income, but little evidence exists on the causal impact of labor policies on wage markdowns.  Using confidential Mexican economic census data from 1994 to 2019, we document a rising trend over this period in on-site outsourcing. Then, leveraging data from a manufacturing panel survey from 2013 to 2023 and a natural experiment featuring a ban on domestic outsourcing in 2021, we show that the ban drastically reduced outsourcing, increased wages, and reduced measured markdowns without lowering output or employment. Consistent with the presence of monopsony power, we observe large markdowns for the largest firms, with the decline in markdowns in response to the ban concentrated among high-markdown firms. However, we also find that the reform reduced capital investment and increased the probability of market exit.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32024,32024,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
The Mismeasurement of Work Time: Implications for Wage Discrimination and Inequality,"George J. Borjas, Daniel S. Hamermesh","Comparing measures of work time in the recall CPS-ASEC data with contemporaneous measures reveals many logical inconsistencies and probable errors. About 8 percent of ASEC respondents report weeks worked last year that contradict their current work histories in the Basic monthly interviews; the error rate is over 50 percent among workers who move in and out of the workforce. Over 20 percent give contradictory information about whether they usually work a full-time weekly schedule. Part of the inconsistency arises because an increasing fraction of ASEC respondents (over 20 percent by 2018) consists of people whose record was fully imputed. The levels and trends of the errors differ by gender and race, and they affect measured wage differentials between 1978 to 2018. Adjusting for the errors and imputations, gender wage gaps among all workers narrowed by 4 log points more than is commonly reported, and residual wage inequality decreased by 6 log points more. In a very carefully defined sample of full-time year-round workers, gender and racial wage differentials  narrowed slightly less than previously estimated using ASEC data, but much more than indicated by commonly used estimates from CPS Outgoing Rotation Groups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32025,32025,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
"Monetary Tightening, Inflation Drivers and Financial Stress","Frederic Boissay, Fabrice Collard, Cristina Manea, Adam Shapiro","The paper explores the state–dependent effects of a monetary tightening on financial stress, focusing on a novel dimension: the nature of supply versus demand inflation at the time of policy rate hikes. We use local projections to estimate the effect of high frequency identified monetary policy surprises on a variety of financial stress measures, differentiating the effects based on whether inflation is supply–driven (e.g. due to adverse supply or cost–push shocks) or demand–driven (e.g. due to positive demand factors). We find that financial stress flares up after a policy rate hike when inflation is supply–driven, but it remains roughly unchanged, or even declines when inflation is demand–driven. Our findings point to a particular tension between price stability and financial stability when inflation is high and largely supply–driven.",https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/working-papers/2023/38/,2023-38,12/1/2023,FED-SANFRANCISCO,1/8/2024

Bankruptcy Exemption of Repo Markets: Too Much Today for Too Little Tomorrow?,"Viral V. Acharya, V. Ravi Anshuman, S. Vish Viswanathan","We examine the desirability of granting “safe harbor” provisions to creditors of financial intermediaries in sale-and-repurchase (repo) contracts. Exemption from an automatic stay in bankruptcy enables financial intermediaries to raise greater liquidity and induces entry of intermediaries with higher leverage during normal times. This liquidity creation occurs, however, at the cost of ex-post inefficiency when there are adverse aggregate shocks to the fundamental quality of collateral underlying the contracts. When exempt from bankruptcy, creditors of highly leveraged financial intermediaries respond to such shocks by engaging in collateral liquidations. Financial arbitrage by less leveraged financial intermediaries equilibrates returns from acquiring collateral at fire-sale prices and returns from real-sector lending, inducing higher lending rates, a deterioration in endogenous asset quality, and in the extremis, a credit crunch for the real sector. Given this distributive externality, taming the leverage cycle by not granting safe harbors, i.e., requiring an automatic stay on repo contracts in bankruptcy, can be not only ex-post optimal, but also ex-ante optimal, especially for illiquid collateral with high exposure to aggregate risk.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32027,32027,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Trust and Health Care-Seeking Behavior,"Michael E. Darden, Mario Macis","We present results from a nationally representative survey of American adults, guided by a simple theoretical model expressing health care-seeking behavior as a function of economic and behavioral fundamentals and highlighting the role of trust. We report several findings. First, we document a strong association between higher levels of trust in the health care system and reported care-seeking behavior, both retrospective and anticipated. This relationship holds across several care scenarios, from routine check-ups to vaccinations. Second, the impact of trust on health care utilization is similar in magnitude to that of factors such as income and education, long recognized as crucial in the existing literature. Third, the relationship between trust and care-seeking behavior appears to be mediated by key mechanisms from our theoretical framework, notably individuals’ beliefs about the system's effectiveness in managing their health and their personal disutility tied to medical visits. Fourth, we ask respondents about trust in specific health care system sectors, and we find important heterogeneity in the associations between trust and care-seeking behavior, notably between trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the likelihood to receive flu and COVID-19 vaccinations. Finally, we find no differential relationship between trust and care-seeking for Black respondents, but we find important differences by age and political affiliation. Our findings hold significant implications for policy, particularly given that trust in medical and, more broadly, scientific expertise is increasingly difficult to establish.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32028,32028,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
"Job Loss, Credit Card Loans, and the College-persistence Decision of US Working Students",Pinghui Wu and Lucy McMillan,"This study assesses the impact of involuntary job loss on college persistence by leveraging different job-loss timings relative to a student’s college enrollment decision. We find that job loss increases the probability that a working college student leaves college before attaining a degree, but access to short-term credit through credit card loans buffers this liquidity effect. By restricting credit supply to college students, the CARD Act of 2009 has inadvertently inhibited the ability of liquidity-constrained students to remain in college when their earnings unexpectedly fall, resulting in a stronger liquidity effect of job loss on college persistence over the last decade.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/job-loss-credit-card-loans-and-the-college-persistence-decision-of-us-working-students,23-19,2-Jan-24,FED-BOSTON,1/8/2024

The Puzzling Behavior of Spreads during Covid,"Stelios Fourakis, Loukas Karabarbounis","Advanced economies borrowed substantially during the Covid recession to fund their fiscal policy. The Covid recession differed from the Great Recession in that sovereign debt markets remained calm and spreads barely responded. We study the experience of Greece, the most extreme manifestation of the puzzling behavior of spreads during Covid. We develop a small open economy model with long-term debt and default, which we augment with official lenders, heterogeneous households and sectors, and Covid constraints on labor supply and consumption demand. The model is quantitatively consistent with the observed boom-bust cycle of Greece before Covid and salient observations on macro aggregates, government debt, and the sovereign spread during Covid. The spread is stable despite a rise in external borrowing during Covid, because lockdowns were perceived as transitory and the bailouts of the 2010s had tilted the composition of debt at the beginning of Covid away from defaultable private debt. The ECB's policy of purchasing debt in secondary markets during Covid did not stabilize spreads so much, but allowed the government to provide transfers that reduced inequality.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/working-papers/the-puzzling-behavior-of-spreads-during-covid,803,9-Jan-24,FED-MINNEAPOLIS,1/9/2024
Dynamic carbon emission management,"Maria Cecilia Bustamante, Francesca Zucchi","The control of carbon emissions by policymakers poses the corporate challenge of developing an optimal carbon management policy. We provide a unified model that characterizes how firms should optimally manage emissions through production, green investment, and the trading of carbon credits. We show that carbon pricing reduces firms’ emissions but also induces firms to tilt towards more immediate yet transient types of green investment—such as abatement as opposed to innovation—as it becomes costlier to comply. Green innovation subsidies mitigate this effect and complement carbon pricing in ensuring innovation-driven sustainability. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that carbon regulation need not reduce firm value.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2885~f79eb3dbc6.en.pdf?42eb71897ab13a34044238e58350d8d4,2885,10-Jan-24,ECB,1/11/2024
How Do Consumers Use Firm Disclosure? Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment,"Sinja Leonelli, Maximilian Muhn, Thomas Rauter, Gurpal Sran","We combine a large-scale field experiment with a customized survey to study whether and how consumers use firm disclosure. In a sample of more than 24,000 U.S. households, we first establish several stylized facts: (i) the average consumer has a moderate preference to purchase from ESG-responsible firms; (ii) consumers typically have no preference for more or less profitable firms; (iii) consumers rarely consult ESG reports and virtually never use financial reports to inform their purchase decisions. In our field experiment, we then inform households about real firm-disclosed profitability and ESG activities through seven randomized information treatments. Consumers increase their purchase intent when exogenously presented with firm-disclosed positive signals about environmental, social, and—to a lesser extent—governance activities. Full ESG reports only have an impact on consumers who choose to view them, whereas financial reports and earnings information do not have an effect. After the experiment, consumers increase their actual product purchases, but these effects are small, short-lived, and only materialize for viewed ESG reports and positive social signals. Through a follow-up survey, we provide explanations for why consumers (do not) change their shopping behavior after our information experiment.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/how-do-consumers-use-firm-disclosure-evidence-from-a-randomized-field-experiment/,4/1/2024,9-Jan-24,BFI,1/11/2024

On the liability side, they may be subject to depositor runs whenever they offer demandable contracts. This structure allows us to review the literature on the role of market power for credit provision and stability and also highlight the interactions between the two sides of banks’ balance sheets.

Policy reforms could help involuntary parttimers and women with young children raise their actual hours towards desired levels, but the aggregate impact on average hours would be limited to 0.5 to 1.5 percent.

Using data on seven different bank interest rates in 30 European countries, different approaches, and the full sample as well as a subsample of euro area countries, we show that a) the pass-through in the post-pandemic hiking cycle has been heterogenous across countries and types of interest rates; b) the pass-through has generally been weaker and slower, except for rates of non-financial corporation loans and time deposits in euro area countries; c) differences in pass-through over time and across countries for most deposit rates are correlated with financial sector concentration, liquidity, and loan opportunities, and d) the effects of pass-through to outstanding mortgage rates on monetary transmission on prices and output are heterogenous across countries.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/12/Monetary-Policy-Pass-Through-to-Interest-Rates-Stylized-Facts-from-30-European-Countries-543715,WPIEA2024009,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/13/2024
Searching for Wage Growth: Policy Responses to the “New Machine Age”,"Andrew Berg, Edward F Buffie, Mariarosaria Comunale, Chris Papageorgiou, Luis-Felipe Zanna","The current wave of technological revolution is changing the way policies work. This paper examines the growth and distributional implications of three policies when “robot'' capital (a broad definition of robots, Artificial Intelligence, computers, big data, digitalization, networks, sensors and servos) is introduced in a neoclassical growth model. 1) cuts to the corporate tax rate; 2) increases in education spending; and 3) increases in infrastructure investment. We find that incorporating “robot'' capital into the model does make a big difference to policy outcomes: the trickle-down effects of corporate tax cuts on unskilled wages are attenuated, and the advantages of investment in infrastructure, and especially in education, are bigger. Based on our calibrations grounded on new empirical estimates, infrastructure investment and corporate tax cuts dominate investment in education in a ""traditional"" economy. However, in an economy with “robots” the infrastructure investment dominates corporate tax cuts, while investment in education tends to produce the highest welfare gains of all. The specific results, of course, may depend on the exact modeling of the technological change, but our main results remain valid and can provide more accurate welfare rankings.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/12/Searching-for-Wage-Growth-Policy-Responses-to-the-New-Machine-Age-542873,WPIEA2024003,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/13/2024
What Caused the Beveridge Curve to Shift Higher in the United States During the Pandemic?,"Gene Kindberg-Hanlon, Michael Girard","The Beveridge curve shifted substantially higher in the United States following the start of the COVID pandemic. In 2022, vacancies reached record highs across all sectors while unemployment fell to pre-pandemic lows. At the same time, the pandemic has resulted in severe labor shortages, and we estimate that the labor force was approximately 2 million below trend at the start of 2023. We exploit state-level data in the United States to find that lower immigration, higher excess mortality due to COVID, and falling older-worker labor force participation were associated with larger upward shifts in the Beveridge curve. We also find that states that had a larger employment concentration in contact-intensive sectors had larger upward shifts in their Beveridge curve. While the effect of sectoral reallocation and rehiring has been shown in theoretical models to lift the Beveridge curve, we show that worker shortages also result in an upward shift in the Beveridge curve if they increase the marginal product of labor. This result holds in a search and matching model with on-the-job search, but does not hold without on-the-job search.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/12/What-Caused-the-Beveridge-Curve-to-Shift-Higher-in-the-United-States-During-the-Pandemic-542870,WPIEA2024008,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/13/2024
Central bank digital currency: when price and bank stability collide,"Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Linda Schilling, Harald Uhlig","This paper shows the existence of a central bank trilemma. When a central bank is involved in financial intermediation, either directly through a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or indirectly through other policy instruments, it can only achieve at most two of three objectives: a socially eÿcient allocation, financial stability (i.e., absence of runs), and price stability. In particular, a commitment to price stability can cause a run on the central bank. Implementation of the socially optimal allocation requires a commitment to inflation. We illustrate this idea through a nominal version of the Diamond and Dybvig (1983) model. Our perspective may be particularly appropriate when CBDCs are introduced on a wide scale.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2888~a557bfafbb.en.pdf?067788a327b36dc17a397fa849c3c0ed,2888,15-Jan-24,ECB,1/16/2024
Destabilisation of bank deposits across destinations: assessment and policy implications,"Ulrich Bindseil, Richard Senner","Rapid and large deposit outflows from banks have regained attention in the context of the March 2023 demises of Credit Suisse, SVB and other regional US banks. Moreover, the possible introduction of CBDC or a marked success of stablecoins are perceived as additional clouds over the future of deposit funding. While the bank run literature rarely pays attention to where bank deposits can flow to, this paper distinguishes the different flow of funds mechanics across all possible destinations and reviews for each the current and prospective future factors that may contribute to the observed increase of the speed and size of bank runs. While some of these factors can be contained through policy measures, others, like the intensified competition between banks will inevitably stay, and bank balance sheet management and liquidity regulation need to accept the new normal of somewhat less stable and more expensive sight deposits.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2887~845e136b3b.en.pdf?e8515accd3d688ab48f11176a9c93da4,2887,15-Jan-24,ECB,1/16/2024
"Firm heterogeneity, capital misallocation and optimal monetary policy","Beatriz González, Galo Nuño, Dominik Thaler, Silvia Albrizio","This paper analyzes the link between monetary policy and capital misallocation in a New Keynesian model with heterogeneous firms and financial frictions. In the model, firms with a high return to capital increase their investment more strongly in response to a monetary policy expansion, thus reducing misallocation. This feature creates a new time-inconsistent incentive for the central bank to engineer an unexpected monetary expansion to temporarily reduce misallocation. However, price stability is the optimal timeless response to demand, financial or TFP shocks. Finally, we present firm-level evidence supporting the theoretical mechanism.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2890~94e47daa0a.en.pdf?f226178a2510e817771f398623376e8d,2890,16-Jan-24,ECB,1/16/2024
Price Sensitivity and Information Barriers to the Take-up of Naloxone,"Mireille Jacobson, David Powell","We conducted a field experiment that randomized advertisements, advertisement content, and prices across 2,204 counties in the United States to study the impacts on online purchases of naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug. Advertising increased website users but only impacted purchases when combined with a price reduction. Messages emphasizing the discreet nature of online sales had no additional impact on purchases. Comparing counties with advertisements featuring a highly discounted price to those featuring the full price, we estimate a price elasticity of demand for online naloxone of -1.3.

Automation and Gender: Implications for Occupational Segregation and the Gender Skill Gap,"Patricia Cortés, Ying Feng, Nicolás Guida-Johnson, Jessica Pan","We examine the differential effects of automation on the labor market and educational outcomes of women relative to men over the past four decades. Although women were disproportionately employed in occupations with a high risk of automation in 1980, they were more likely to shift to high-skill, high-wage occupations than men in over time. We provide a causal link by exploiting variation in local labor market exposure to automation attributable to historical differences in local industry structure. For a given change in the exposure to automation across commuting zones, women were more likely than men to shift out of routine task-intensive occupations to high-skill, high wage occupations over the subsequent decade. The net effect is that initially routine-intensive local labor markets experienced greater occupational gender integration. College attainment among younger workers, particularly women, also rose significantly more in areas more exposed to automation. We propose a model of occupational choice with endogenous skill investments, where social skills and routine tasks are q-complements, and women have a comparative advantage in social skills, to explain the observed patterns. Supporting the model mechanisms, areas with greater exposure to automation experienced a greater movement of women into occupations with high social skill (and high cognitive) requirements than men.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32030,32030,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Intergenerational Mobility and Credit,"J. Carter Braxton, Nisha Chikhale, Kyle F. Herkenhoff, Gordon M. Phillips","We combine the Decennial Census, credit reports, and administrative earnings to create the first panel dataset linking parent’s credit access to the labor market outcomes of children in the U.S. We find that a 10% increase in parent’s unused revolving credit during their children’s adolescence (13 to 18 years old) is associated with 0.28% to 0.37% greater labor earnings of their children during early adulthood (25 to 30 years old). Using these empirical elasticities, we estimate a dynastic, defaultable debt model to examine how the democratization of credit since the 1970s – modeled as both greater credit limits and more lenient bankruptcy – affected intergenerational mobility. Surprisingly, we find that the democratization of credit led to less intergenerational mobility and greater inequality. Two offsetting forces underlie this result: (1) greater credit limits raise mobility by facilitating borrowing and investment among low-income households; (2) however, more lenient bankruptcy policy lowers mobility since low-income households dissave, hit their constraints more often, and reduce investments in their children. Quantitatively, the democratization of credit is dominated by more lenient bankruptcy policy and so mobility declines between the 1970s and 2000s.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32031,32031,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
The Role of Friends in the Opioid Epidemic,"Effrosyni Adamopoulou, Jeremy Greenwood, Nezih Guner, Karen Kopecky","The role of friends in the US opioid epidemic is examined. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health), adults aged 25-34 and their high school best friends are focused on. An instrumental variable technique is employed to estimate peer effects in opioid misuse. Severe injuries in the previous year are used as an instrument for opioid misuse in order to estimate the causal impact of someone misusing opioids on the probability that their best friends also misuse. The estimated peer effects are significant: Having a best friend with a reported serious injury in the previous year increases the probability of own opioid misuse by around 7 percentage points in a population where 17 percent ever misuses opioids. The effect is driven by individuals without a college degree and those who live in the same county as their best friends.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32032,32032,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Uncertainty and Individual Discretion in Allocating Research Funds,"Anna Goldstein, Michael Kearney","There is a long-standing tradition in public research funding agencies of distributing funds via peer review, which aggregates evaluations of proposed research ideas from a group of external experts. Despite complaints that this process is biased against novel ideas, there is poor understanding of an alternative system that may overcome this bias: the use of individual discretion. Here, we conduct the first quantitative study of how individual discretion affects a research funding portfolio. Using internal project selection data from the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), we describe how a portfolio of projects selected by individual discretion differs from a portfolio of projects selected by traditional peer review. We show that ARPA-E program directors tend to fund proposals with greater disagreement among experts, and they also appear to prefer proposals described in reviewer comments as “creative.” These choices do not result in a significant tradeoff with short-term project performance, and they enable ARPA-E to fund more uncertain and creative research ideas, which supports the agency’s mission of pursuing novel ideas for transformational energy technology.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32033,32033,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
"Fiscal Stimulus, Deposit Competition, and the Rise of Shadow Banking: Evidence from China","Viral V. Acharya, Qian Jun, Yang Su, Zhishu Yang","The rise of shadow banking and attendant financial fragility in China can be traced to intensified deposit competition following the global financial crisis (GFC). Deposit competition intensified after the GFC because the GFC slowed down banks’ deposit growth from cross-border money inflows and simultaneously led to fiscal stimulus supported by banks’ credit expansion. Exploiting the fact that one big state-owned bank was particular affected by the GFC through these two channels, we document—by exploring small and medium-sized banks’ branch-level overlap with this big bank—that deposit competition increased banks’ reliance on shadow banking. In particular, exposed banks issued Wealth Management Products (WMPs)—short-maturity, off-balance-sheet substitutes for deposits—creating rollover risks for the issuers, as reflected by higher yields on new WMPs, higher borrowing rates in the interbank market, and lower stock-market performance during liquidity stress.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32034,32034,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Homeward Bound: How Migrants Seek Out Familiar Climates,"Marguerite Obolensky, Marco Tabellini, Charles Taylor","This paper introduces the concept of “climate matching” as a driver of migration and establishes several new results. First, we show that climate strongly predicts the spatial distribution of immigrants in the US, both historically (1880) and more recently (2015), whereby movers select destinations with climates similar to their place of origin. Second, we analyze historical flows of German, Norwegian, and domestic migrants in the US and document that climate sorting also holds within countries. Third, we exploit variation in the long-run change in average US climate from 1900 to 2019 and find that migration increased more between locations whose climate converged. Fourth, we verify that results are not driven by the persistence of ethnic networks or other confounders, and provide evidence for two complementary mechanisms: climate-specific human capital and climate as amenity. Fifth, we back out the value of climate similarity by: i) exploiting the Homestead Act, a historical policy that changed relative land prices; and, ii) examining the relationship between climate mismatch and mortality. Finally, we project how climate change shapes the geography of US population growth by altering migration patterns, both historically and into the 21st century.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32035,32035,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
"The Modern Wholesaler: Global Sourcing, Domestic Distribution, and Scale Economies",Sharat Ganapati,"Nearly half of all transactions in the $5 trillion market for manufactured goods in the United States were intermediated by wholesalers in 2012, up from 32 percent in 1992. Seventy percent of this increase is due to the growth of “superstar” firms - the largest one percent of wholesalers. Estimates based on detailed administrative data show that the rise of the largest firms was driven by an intuitive linkage between their sourcing of goods from abroad and an expansion of their domestic distribution network to reach more buyers. Both elements require scale economies and lead to increased wholesaler market shares and markups. Counterfactual analysis shows that despite increases in wholesaler market power and markups, scale has benefits. Buyers gain access to globally sourced varieties, nationwide distribution networks, and increased quality while wholesalers decrease their marginal costs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32036,32036,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Trade Barriers and Market Power: Evidence from Argentina's Discretionary Import Restrictions,"David Atkin, Joaquin Blaum, Pablo D. Fajgelbaum, Augusto Ospital","Countries are increasingly turning to non-tariff barriers that are hard to measure and often illegal under WTO rules. What are the impacts of these policies, and what do they reveal about market power in international trade? We study a comprehensive system of discretionary import licenses imposed by Argentina, where we observe the universe of transaction-level requests and approval decisions between 2013 and 2015. Approvals varied across firms and products in a manner consistent with the government's trade and investment objectives, and over time to safeguard the current account. Interacting these sources of variation to construct an instrument, we estimate that stricter restrictions increased the prices paid by importers, a result that runs counter to competitive price-setting behavior. Informed by a model and a classifier-Lasso, the price and quantity responses identify—for each combination of importer, narrow product, and origin—which side (importer or exporter) holds market power. We find that larger importers are more likely to hold market power, and those trading with richer countries are less likely to. The market-power distribution strongly shapes the effects of quantitative restrictions and the magnitude of optimal tariffs. Import prices rose by 4% as a result of Argentina's import restrictions, but would have risen by 13% (fallen by 8%) had all foreign firms (Argentinian firms) held market power.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32037,32037,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Bootstrap Diagnostics for Irregular Estimators,"Isaiah Andrews, Jesse M.

When such approximations are unreliable, they can lead the audience to make misguided decisions. We propose to measure the failure of the conventional normal approximation for a given estimator by the total variation distance between a bootstrap distribution and the normal distribution parameterized by the point estimate and standard error. For a wide class of decision problems and a class of uninformative priors, we show that a multiple of the total variation distance bounds the mistakes which result from relying on the conventional normal approximation. In a sample of recent empirical articles that use a bootstrap for inference, we find that the conventional normal approximation is often poor. We suggest and illustrate convenient alternative reports for such settings.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32038,32038,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024

What Works and For Whom? Effectiveness and Efficiency of School Capital Investments Across The U.S.,"Barbara Biasi, Julien M. Lafortune, David Schönholzer","This paper identifies which investments in school facilities help students and are valued by homeowners. Using novel data on school district bonds, test scores, and house prices for 29 U.S. states and a research design that exploits close elections with staggered timing, we show that increased school capital spending raises test scores and house prices on average. However, impacts differ vastly across types of funded projects. Spending on basic infrastructure (such as HVAC) or on the removal of pollutants raises test scores but not house prices; conversely, spending on athletic facilities raises house prices but not test scores. Socio-economically disadvantaged districts benefit more from capital outlays, even conditioning on project type and the existing capital stock. Our estimates suggest that closing the spending gap between high- and low-SES districts and targeting spending towards high-impact projects may close as much as 25% of the observed achievement gap between these districts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32040,32040,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024

We answer this question using a dynamic multi-sector model in which electricity is a strong complement to other inputs in production. We parameterize the model using our own new measures of electricity-sector TFP across countries. The model predicts modest long-run GDP gains from improving electricity-sector TFP, contrary to the notion that electricity is a weak link. Parameterizations that make electricity a weak link mostly require the electricity sector to be counterfactually large or unproductive.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32041,32041,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Local Variation in Onsite Work during the Pandemic and its Aftermath,"Katharine G. Abraham, Mohammad Ashoori, Aref Darzi, Nathalie Gonzalez-Prieto, John C. Haltiwanger, Aliakbar Kabiri, Erkut Y. Ozbay","Using longitudinal data on the location of mobile devices, we provide new evidence on the evolution of onsite work (OSW) over the course of the pandemic and its aftermath. We start with a large sample of individuals who, based on their mobile device activity, had a job at which they worked onsite in February 2020. We track the evolution of these individuals’ onsite work activity over the following thirteen to fourteen months, observing them in May 2020, August 2020, November 2020 and March/April 2021. Consistent with other evidence, we find a dramatic decline in OSW in May 2020 followed by a substantial rebound by the spring of 2021, albeit to a lower level than in February 2020. We document considerable cross-state, cross-city and cross-county variation in OSW. We also find, however, that the tract-level variation in OSW within states, cities and even counties far exceeds the variation across larger geographic areas. Observable characteristics such as industry, occupation, education and income account for much of the variation in OSW across large geographic areas since the pandemic. These same variables account for much of the enormous cross-tract variation in OSW that remains after controlling for state or county, but more than half of the cross-tract variation is accounted for by residual factors. These findings imply considerable heterogeneity in how the pandemic has affected where the resident populations of U.S. neighborhoods spend their days, a finding that has significant implications for businesses, workers, and policymakers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32042,32042,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Stated Preference Estimates of the Average Social Cost of Carbon,"Matthew Ashenfarb, Matthew Kotchen","This paper provides stated preference (SP) estimates of the average social cost of carbon (ASCC) for use in evaluation of the benefits and costs of climate policy. Based on a U.S. nationally representative survey, we find an average individual willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $1,116 per year to keep global warming less than 2°C by 2100 compared to a business-as-usual temperature change. Combining the WTP estimate with population projections and assessments of the required emission reductions, we find a domestic ASCC of $8 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2). Applying a benefits transfer approach to infer WTP in other countries, we obtain an estimate of the global ASCC of $39 per tonne, with a 95-percent confidence interval of $32-$48. The estimate is insensitive to the discount rate, but it does vary with assumptions about the income elasticity of WTP and the rate of change in marginal abatement costs. Reasonable scenarios create a range of estimates between $12-$118 per tonne. We also examine the impact of distributional weighting based on the elasticity of the marginal utility of income, providing distributionally-weighted estimates of the global ASCC for use in all countries. We argue that a SP estimate of the ASCC is an useful complement to existing estimates of the marginal social cost of carbon (SCC) based on different valuation approaches.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32043,32043,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
The Puzzling Behavior of Spreads during Covid,"Stelios S. Fourakis, Loukas Karabarbounis","Advanced economies borrowed substantially during the Covid recession to fund their fiscal policy. The Covid recession differed from the Great Recession in that sovereign debt markets remained calm and spreads barely responded. We study the experience of Greece, the most extreme manifestation of the puzzling behavior of spreads during Covid. We develop a small open economy model with long-term debt and default, which we augment with official lenders, heterogeneous households and sectors, and Covid constraints on labor supply and consumption demand. The model is quantitatively consistent with the observed boom-bust cycle of Greece before Covid and salient observations on macro aggregates, government debt, and the sovereign spread during Covid. The spread is stable despite a rise in external borrowing during Covid, because lockdowns were perceived as transitory and the bailouts of the 2010s had tilted the composition of debt at the beginning of Covid away from defaultable private debt. The ECB's policy of purchasing debt in secondary markets during Covid did not stabilize spreads so much, but allowed the government to provide transfers that reduced inequality.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32044,32044,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
The Impact of Comprehensive Student Support on Crime: Evidence from the Pathways to Education Program,"Adam M.

The program, called Pathways to Education, bundles supports such as regular coaching, tutoring, group activities, free public transportation tickets and bursaries for postsecondary education. In this paper, we use a difference-in-differences approach that compares students living in public housing communities where the program was offered to those living in communities where the program was not offered over time. We find that eligibility for Pathways reduces the likelihood of being charged with a crime by 32 percent at its Regent Park location.

Religious Conversion across Countries,"Robert J. Barro, Rachel M.

The International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) waves for 1991, 1998, 2008, and 2018 allow for calculations of country-wide conversion rates based on religion adherence at the time of each survey and a retrospective question that gauges adherence when the respondent was raised. The analysis applies to 8 types of religion for 58 countries (125 total observations). The rate of conversion depends positively on measures of religious pluralism, negatively on official restrictions that inhibit conversion, negatively on a history of Communism, negatively on real per capita GDP, and positively on years of schooling.

Monetary-fiscal policy interactions when price stability occasionally takes a back seat,Sebastian Schmidt,"What are the macroeconomic consequences of a government that is limited in its willingness or ability to raise primary surpluses, and a central bank that accommodates its interest-rate policy to the fiscal conditions? I address this question in a dynamic stochastic sticky-price model with endogenous shifts between an “orthodox” and a “fiscally-dominant” policy regime. The risk of future regime shifts has encompassing effects on equilibrium. Inflation is systematically higher than it would be if fiscal policy always adjusted its primary surplus sufficiently and monetary policy was solely concerned with price stability. This inflation bias is increasing in the real value of government debt. Regime-switching probabilities are not invariant to policy. The central bank can attenuate the risk of a shift to the fiscally-dominant regime by raising the real interest rate sufficiently moderately when inflation increases. Lower fiscal dominance risk, in turn, mitigates the inflation bias.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2889~b14c2f4ff1.en.pdf?a9dcca2393ecfb37818e4298f96143f5,2889,16-Jan-24,ECB,1/16/2024

Granular shocks to corporate leverage and the macroeconomic transmission of monetary policy,"Fédéric Holm-Hadulla, Claire Thürwächter","We study how shocks to corporate leverage alter the macroeconomic transmission of monetary policy. We identify leverage shocks as idiosyncratic firm-level disturbances that are aggregated up to a size-weighted country-level average to generate a Granular Instrumental Variable (Gabaix and Koijen, forthcoming). Interacting this instrumental variable with high-frequency identified monetary policy shocks, we find that transmission to the price level strengthens in the presence of leverage shocks, while the real effects of monetary policy are unaffected. We show that this disconnect can be rationalized with an internal devaluationchannel. Economies experiencing an increase in leverage exhibit a stronger monetary policy-induced contraction in domestic demand. This, however, is counteracted by a weaker contraction in exports, facilitated by their improved price competitiveness.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2891~7eb017c33f.en.pdf?73042c95f428bfa1b33ef4b25af8f9b7,2891,17-Jan-24,ECB,1/17/2024
"Insurance corporations’ balance sheets, financial stability and monetary policy","Christoph Kaufmann, Jaime Leyva, Manuela Storz","The euro area insurance sector and its relevance for real economy financing have grown significantly over the last two decades. This paper analyses the effects of monetary policy on the size and composition of insurers’ balance sheets, as well as the implications of these effects for financial stability. We find that changes in monetary policy have a significant impact on both sector size and risk-taking. Insurers’ balance sheets grow materially after a monetary loosening, implying an increase of the sector’s financial intermediation capacity and an active transmission of monetary policy through the insurance sector. We also find evidence of portfolio re-balancing consistent with the risk-taking channel of monetary policy. After a monetary loosening, insurers increase credit, liquidity and duration risk-taking in their asset portfolios.

Monetary Policy across Inflation Regimes,"Valeria Gargiulo, Christian Matthes, and Katerina Petrova","Does the effect of monetary policy depend on the prevailing level of inflation? In order to answer this question, we construct a parsimonious nonlinear time series model that allows for inflation regimes. We find that the effects of monetary policy are markedly different when year-over-year inflation exceeds 5.5 percent. Below this threshold, changes in monetary policy have a short-lived effect on prices, but no effect on the unemployment rate, giving a potential explanation for the recent “soft landing” in the United States. Above this threshold, the effects of monetary policy surprises on both inflation and unemployment can be larger and longer lasting.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1083,1083,1/15/2024,FED-NEWYORK,1/17/2024
On the Validity of Classical and Bayesian DSGE-Based Inference,Katerina Petrova,"This paper studies large sample classical and Bayesian inference in a prototypical linear DSGE model and demonstrates that inference on the structural parameters based on a Gaussian likelihood is unaffected by departures from Gaussianity of the structural shocks. This surprising result is due to a cancellation in the asymptotic variance resulting into a generalized information equality for the block corresponding to the structural parameters. The underlying reason for the cancellation is the certainty equivalence property of the linear rational expectation model.  The main implication of this result is that classical and Bayesian Gaussian inference achieve a semi-parametric efficiency bound and there is no need for a “sandwich-form” correction of the asymptotic variance of the structural parameters. Consequently, MLE-based confidence intervals and Bayesian credible sets of the deep parameters based on a Gaussian likelihood have correct asymptotic coverage even when the structural shocks are non-Gaussian. On the other hand, inference on the reduced-form parameters characterizing the volatility of the shocks is invalid whenever the structural shocks have a non-Gaussian density and the paper proposes a simple Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm that achieves correct large sample inference for the volatility parameters.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1084,1084,1/16/2024,FED-NEWYORK,1/17/2024
Self-Employment and Labor Market Risks,Richard Audoly,"I study the labor market risks associated with being self-employed.

Given that the self-employed are not eligible to unemployment insurance, I analyze the provision of benefits targeted at these risks using a calibrated search model with (i) precautionary savings, (ii) work opportunities in paid and self-employment, and (iii) skill heterogeneity. This exercise suggests that extending the current U.S. unemployment insurance scheme to the self-employed comes with a clear increase in the transition rate from self-employment to unemployment and an unequal benefits-to-contributions ratio across skill groups. At the calibrated parameters, the self-employed in the middle of the skill distribution lose welfare.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1085,1085,1/17/2024,FED-NEWYORK,1/17/2024

Structural Change and the Rise in Markups,Ricardo Marto,"Is the recent rise in markups caused by increased monopoly power or is it a natural consequence of structural change? I show that the rise in aggregate markups has been driven by a reallocation of market share away from non-services to services-producing firms and a faster increase of services’ markups. I develop a two-sector model to assess the sources of the rise in markups, in which the two forces of structural change play opposing roles. On one hand, an increase in the relative productivity of manufacturing leads to a decline of the relative price of manufactured goods and to an increase of the goods markups. On the other hand, the increase in incomes that triggers the rise of the services sector leads to higher markups for firms in services. I show that the rise in markups is in line with the rise of the services sector and the fall of the relative price of manufactured goods, and may not necessarily reflect a decline of competition. I provide novel experimental evidence supporting the notion that the price elasticity of demand decreases with income.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-002,2024-002B,24-Jan,FED-STLOUIS,1/17/2024
The Shifting and Steepening of Phillips Curves During the Pandemic Recovery: International Evidence and Some Theory,"Tryggvi Gudmundsson, Chris Jackson, Rafael A Portillo","We study the global inflation surge during the pandemic recovery and the implications for aggregate and sectoral Phillips curves. We provide evidence that Phillips curves shifted up and steepened across advanced economies, and that differences in the inflation response across sectors imply the relative price of goods has been pro-cyclical this time around rather than a-cyclical as during previous cycles. We show analytically that these three features emerge endogenously in a two-sector new-Keynesian model when we introduce unbalanced recoveries that run against a supply constraint in the goods sector. A calibrated exercise shows that the resulting changes to the output-inflation relation are quantitatively important and improve the model's ability to replicate the inflation surge during this period.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/12/The-Shifting-and-Steepening-of-Phillips-Curves-During-the-Pandemic-Recovery-International-543712,WPIEA2024007,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/17/2024
Where Did the Workers Go? The Effect of COVID Immigration Restrictions on Post-Pandemic Labor Market Tightness,"Maggie Isaacson, Cassie Marks, Lowell R. Ricketts, and Hannah Rubinton","During the COVID pandemic there were unprecedented shortfalls in immigration. At the same time, during the economic recovery, the labor market was tight, with the number of vacancies per unemployed worker reaching 2.5, more than twice its pre-pandemic average. In this paper, we investigate whether these two trends are linked. We do not find evidence to support the hypothesis that the immigration shortfalls caused the tight labor market for two reasons. First, at the peak, we were missing about 2 million immigrant workers, but this number had largely recovered by February 2022 just as the labor market was becoming tight. Second,  states, cities, and industries that were most impacted by the immigration restrictions did not have larger increases in labor market tightness. We build a shift-share instrument to examine the causal impact of the immigration restrictions and still find no evidence to support the hypothesis that the immigration restrictions were the underlying cause of increased labor market tightness.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-003,2024-003B,24-Jan,FED-STLOUIS,1/18/2024

Quantitative easing and the functioning of the gilt repo market,"Mahmoud Fatouh, Simone Giansante and Steven Ongena","We assess the impact of quantitative easing (QE) on the provisioning of liquidity and the pricing in the UK gilt repo market. We compare the behaviour of banks that received reserves injections via QE operations to other similar banks in terms of the amounts lent and pricing. We also investigate whether leverage ratio capital requirements affected the amounts of liquidity supplied by broker-dealers and the spreads they charged. We find that QE interventions can improve liquidity provision, and that their size determines how this is attained. QE can also reduce the cost of borrowing in the repo market unless it was associated with spikes in demand for liquidity. Our findings further indicate that the leverage ratio supports the provision of liquidity during stress, as it prompts banks to become less leveraged. However, the larger capital charge repo transactions attract under the leverage ratio requirement is reflected in their spreads.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/quantitative-easing-and-the-functioning-of-the-gilt-repo-market,1055,"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 ",BOE,1/19/2024

Our approach has particular value in developing-country settings in which granular data on economic activity are scarce. To demonstrate our method, we use multi-spectral imagery—publicly available across the globe—to evaluate India’s varied road construction projects in the early 2000s. Estimating the model requires only remotely-sensed data, while evaluating welfare impacts requires one year of population data, which are increasingly available through public sources. We find that India’s road investments from this period improved aggregate welfare, particularly for the largest and smallest urban markets.

The Economics of Information in a World of Disinformation: A Survey Part 1: Indirect Communication,"Joseph E. Stiglitz, Andrew Kosenko","We survey aspects of the intellectual development of the economics of information from the 1970s to today. We focus here on models where information is communicated indirectly through actions. Basic results, such as the failure of the fundamental theorems of welfare economics, the non-existence of competitive equilibrium, and the dependence of the nature of the equilibrium, when it exists, on both what information is available, and how information can be acquired, have been shown to be robust. Markets create asymmetries of information, even when initially none existed. While the earliest literature paid scarce attention to misinformation, subsequently it has been shown that governments can improve welfare, if disinformation is present, through fraud laws and disclosure requirements. Moreover, robust mechanism design enables agents and governments to better achieve their objectives, taking into account information asymmetries. On the other hand, market reforms that ignored their informational consequences may have lowered welfare.  Surveying both theory and applications, we review the main insights of these literatures, and highlight key messages using nontechnical language.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32049,32049,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024

Sorting under Risk Sharing and Complementarities,"Hector Chade, Ilse Lindenlaub","How does the presence of risk sharing affect sorting patterns on productive attributes when there are  complementarities among partners' skills in match output? We develop a matching model in which risk-averse agents, who differ in skills, match pairwise for productive purposes. Match output has stochastic returns and matched partners efficiently share this risk.  We find that under plausible assumptions the risk-sharing benefit of marriage tends to push toward negative sorting on partners' skills. To obtain the prediction of positive skill sorting—a robust empirical feature of marriage markets—this force needs to be counteracted by sufficiently strong skill complementarities in match output. We provide a novel inequality that characterizes monotone (positive or negative) equilibrium  sorting, balancing out skill complementarities and risk-sharing considerations in the right way. Several classes of primitives (utility and match output functions) render monotone sorting optimal. We then highlight a new implication of positive sorting on exogenous skills for matching patterns on endogenous differences in risk aversion: Positive sorting on skills translates into positive sorting on risk aversion—in line with the evidence from marriage markets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32051,32051,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024

Stacked Difference-in-Differences,"Coady Wing, Seth M.

The set of identified group-time ATTs that contribute to the aggregate is trimmed to achieve compositional balance across an event window, ensuring that comparisons of the aggregate parameter over event time reveal dynamic treatment effects and differential pre-trends rather than compositional changes. Taking the trimmed aggregate ATT as a target parameter, we investigate the performance of stacked DID estimators. We show that the most basic stacked estimator does not identify the target aggregate or any other average causal effect because it applies different implicit weights to treatment and control trends. The bias can be eliminated using corrective sample weights. We present a weighted stacked DID estimator, and show that it correctly identifies the target aggregate, providing justification for using the estimator in applied work.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32054,32054,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
Thick Market Externalities and the Persistence of the Opioid Epidemic,"David M. Cutler, J. Travis Donahoe","Opioid overdose death rates in the United States have risen continuously for over three decades, increasing 2,142 percent in total from 1990 to 2020. This is surprising. One might expect drug epidemics to be self-limiting, as policy and individual behavior reacts to observed deaths. We study why opioid deaths have risen so greatly and for so long. We consider three reasons for a prolonged epidemic: exogenous and continuing changes in demand or supply, and spillovers in demand for opioids across users, which we term “thick market externalities.” We show there is no evidence of sufficiently large exogenous changes in the demand or supply of opioids that could explain such a prolonged increase in death rates. We test for spillovers using county-level data on opioid deaths from 1991–2018 and opioid shipments from 2006–2009, combined with data on friendships and distance between counties. Estimating a model with addiction and spatial spillovers, we find large spillovers in opioid use and deaths across areas. A shock that increases opioid death rates by 1 in an index county causes 0.38 to 0.76 more deaths in other counties because of spillovers. Because opioids are addictive, this leads to even more deaths and spillovers in future years. In some specifications, these effects are large enough to generate a continuously increasing epidemic without any ongoing changes in demand or supply. We estimate spillovers explain 84 to 92 percent of opioid deaths from 1990 to 2018 and are the main reason deaths have increased for so long.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32055,32055,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
"Capital, Ideas, and the Costs of Financial Frictions","Pablo Ottonello, Thomas Winberry","We study the role of financial frictions in determining the allocation of investment and innovation.  Empirically, we find that firms are investment-intensive when they have low net worth but become innovation-intensive as they accumulate more net worth.  To interpret these findings, we develop an endogenous growth model with heterogeneous firms and financial frictions.  In our model, low net worth firms are investment-intensive because their returns to capital are high.  Financial frictions slow the rate at which firms exhaust the returns to capital and shift towards innovation.  Calibrating to the US economy, we find that the resulting lower growth implies large GDP losses even though capital misallocation is small.  In other words, financial markets effectively fund the implementation of existing ideas, but do not adequately fund the discovery of new ideas.  If innovation has positive spillovers, a planner would not only raise innovation but also lower investment expenditures among constrained firms.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32056,32056,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
The Anatomy of Concentration: New Evidence From a Unified Framework,"Kenneth R.

This paper introduces a generalized measure of concentration that allows researchers to vary the relative importance of each force.  Using the generalized measure, we show that the widely-cited evidence of increasing industrial employment concentration is driven by the Herfindahl Index's over-weighting of evenness and under-weighting of firm counts.  We propose an alternative, equally-weighted measure that has an equivalent economic meaning as the Herfindahl Index, but possesses superior statistical attributes in typical firm size distributions. Using this balanced measure, we find that employment concentration decreased from 1990 to 2020.  Finally, decomposing aggregate diversity into meaningful geographic and industry subdivisions reveals that concentration within regional markets has fallen, while concentration between markets has risen.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32057,32057,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024

Earmarks are often critiqued for potentially privileging wealthier and more politically connected communities. We find that earmarks target Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities, partly due to targeting water systems serving large populations.

What Do Shareholders Want? Consumer Welfare and the Objective of the Firm,Keith Marzilli Ericson,"Shareholders want a firm's objective function to place some weight on consumer welfare, motivated by both self-interested and altruistic motivations. Firms have a unique technology for improving consumer welfare: lowering inefficient price markups, which increases consumer welfare more than it lowers profits. Optimal pricing formulas can be adapted to account for shareholders' marginal rate of substitution between profits and consumer welfare. Calibrations from preference parameters show many shareholders should place non-trivial weights on consumer welfare.  A survey experiment on a representative sample elicits how shareholders would vote on resolutions giving strategic guidance to firms on what objective to pursue. Only 7% would vote for pure profit maximization. The median individual is indifferent between $0.44 in profits or $1 in consumer surplus, with those owning stocks preferring a lower weight on consumer welfare than non-stockholders.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32064,32064,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
Regularization from Economic Constraints: A New Estimator for Marginal Emissions,"Stephen P. Holland, Erin T. Mansur, Valentin Verdier, Andrew J. Yates","Environmental policy is increasingly concerned with measuring emissions resulting from local changes to electricity consumption. These marginal emissions are challenging to measure because electricity grids encompass multiple locations and the information available to identify the effect of each location’s consumption on grid-wide emissions is limited. We formalize this as a high-dimensional aggregation problem: The effect of electricity consumption on emissions can be estimated precisely for each electricity generating unit (generator), but not precisely enough to obtain reliable estimates of marginal emissions by summing these effects across all generators in a grid. We study how two economic constraints can address this problem: electricity supply equals demand and an assumption of monotonicity. We show that these constraints can be used to formulate a ‘naturally regularized’ estimator, which implements an implicit penalization that does not need to be directly tuned. Under an additional assumption of sparsity, we show that our new estimator solves the high-dimensional aggregation problem, i.e., it is consistent for marginal emissions where the usual regression estimator would not be. We also develop an asymptotically valid method for inference to accompany our estimator. When applied to the U.S. electricity grid with 13 separate consumption regions, our method yields plausible patterns of marginal generation across fuel types and geographic location. Our estimates of region-level marginal emissions are precise, account for imports/exports between regions, and allow for all fuel types to potentially be on the margin.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32065,32065,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
Deadlines Versus Continuous Incentives: Evidence from the Patent Office,"Michael D. Frakes, Melissa F. Wasserman","A quota system with an associated deadline may retain the possibility of worker procrastination and related deadline behaviors.  A performance appraisal system based on continuous temporal incentives, on the other hand, has the potential to alleviate deadline effects but may lose some of the quality-related benefits associated with the flexibility of a quota/deadline system.  We explore these tradeoffs by observing patent examiner behavior and examination quality outcomes surrounding a 2011 reform at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that built on its bi-weekly quota system by adding a set of bonuses tied to daily examination-pendency measures.  We find a substantial reduction in deadline effects and near complete temporal smoothing in examiner behavior in connection with the reform, leading to large reductions in average examination pendency while resulting in no corresponding reductions in the accuracy of examinations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32066,32066,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
Age at Immigrant Arrival and Career Mobility: Evidence from Vietnamese Refugee Migration and the Amerasian Homecoming Act,"Sari Pekkala Kerr, William R. Kerr, Kendall E. Smith","We study the long-run career mobility of young immigrants, mostly refugees, from Vietnam who moved to the United States during 1989-1995. This third and final migration wave of young Vietnamese immigrants was sparked by unexpected events that culminated in the Amerasian Homecoming Act. Characteristics of the wave also minimized selection effects regarding who migrated. Small differences in the age at arrival, specifically being 14-17 years old on entry compared to 18-21, resulted in substantial differences in future economic outcomes. Using Census Bureau data, we characterize the different career profiles of young vs. older immigrants, and we quantify explanatory factors like education, language fluency, and persistence from initial employers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32067,32067,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
Principal Component Analysis for Nonstationary Series,"James D. Hamilton, Jin Xi",This paper develops a procedure for uncovering the common cyclical factors that drive a mix of stationary and nonstationary variables. The method does not require knowing which variables are nonstationary or the nature of the nonstationarity. An application to the FRED-MD macroeconomic dataset demonstrates that the approach offers similar benefits to those of traditional principal component analysis with some added advantages.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w32068,32068,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
The Wandering Scholars: Understanding the Heterogeneity of University Commercialization,"Josh Lerner, Henry J. Manley, Carolyn Stein, Heidi L. Williams","University-based scientific research has long been argued to be a central source of commercial innovation and economic growth.  Yet at the same time, there have been long-held concerns that many university-based discoveries never realize their potential social benefits.  Looking across universities, research and commercialization activities such as start-up formation vary tremendously – variation that could reflect the composition and orientation of faculty research, university-level factors such as patenting and licensing efforts, or broader place-based factors such as location in a technology cluster.  We take a first step towards unpacking this heterogeneity in university commercialization by analyzing how the propensity of academic research to spill over to commercial innovation changes when academics move across universities. Our estimates suggest that at least 15–25% of geographic variation in commercial spillovers from university-based research is attributable to place-specific factors.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32069,32069,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
Money Isn’t Everything: Estimating the Prestige Value of Winning Cutthroat Kitchen from Overbidding in Sabotage Auctions,"Meg Snyder, Daniel Bragen, Matthew Rousu, Christopher M. Snyder","We seek to estimate the prestige value of winning beyond monetary prizes in Cutthroat Kitchen, a cooking show in which dishes are judged in a series of elimination rounds, with the twist that action is periodically paused to auction sabotages against rivals. We estimate the distribution of contestants’ prestige values using a structural model of bidding by a contestant with rational expectations about sabotage effectiveness taken from the data. Our most conservative specification—allowing for risk aversion and bias in the beliefs about sabotage effectiveness—yields mean prestige values of nearly $10,000 for typical episodes and over $35,000 for tournaments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32070,32070,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
UI Benefit Generosity and Labor Supply from 2002-2020,"Alex Bell, TJ Hedin, Geoffrey C.

A regression kink design exploiting nonlinear benefit schedules provides experimental estimates of behavioral labor supply responses throughout the unemployment spell that are comparable over time. For a given unemployment duration, the behavioral effect of UI benefit levels on labor supply is unchanged over the business cycle from 2002 to 2019. However, due to increased coverage from extensions in benefit durations, the duration elasticity of UI benefits rises during recessions.

Import Constraints,"Diego A. Comin, Robert C. Johnson, Callum J. Jones","During the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, international shipping and logistics capacity was strained, limiting the quantity of imports.  We investigate the impact of an import constraint on inflation, following an increase in domestic demand.  Whether the binding import constraint raises inflation depends on how it affects trade intermediation costs.  If the binding constraint raises trade costs, then import price inflation also increases.  In this case, however, foreign producer price inflation falls, and import quantities rise more for inputs than final goods.  Both these model results appear counterfactual, which suggests that import constraints may not explain observed import price inflation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32072,32072,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
"Ends versus Means: Kantians, Utilitarians, and Moral Decisions","Roland Bénabou, Armin Falk, Luca Henkel","Choosing what is morally right can be based on the consequences (ends) resulting from the decision – the Consequentialist view – or on the conformity of the means involved with some overarching notion of duty – the Deontological view. Using a series of experiments, we investigate the overall prevalence and the consistency of consequentialist and deontological decision-making, when these two moral principles come into conflict. Our design includes a real-stakes version of the classical trolley dilemma, four novel games that induce ends-versus-means tradeoffs, and a rule-following task. These six main games are supplemented with six classical self-versus-other choice tasks, allowing us to relate consequential/deontological behavior to standard measures of prosociality. Across the six main games, we find a sizeable prevalence (20 to 44%) of nonconsequentialist choices by subjects, but no evidence of stable individual preference types across situations. In particular, trolley behavior predicts no other ends-versus-means choices. Instead, which moral principle prevails appears to be context-dependent. In contrast, we find a substantial level of consistency across self-versus-other decisions, but individuals’ degree of prosociality is unrelated to how they choose in ends-versus-means tradeoffs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32073,32073,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024

We find that employees who opted into the program kept using it. Among employees whose accounts were created early enough to be observed over the first 12 months after their account activation and who did not separate from employment during this period, 96% still had a balance greater than £1 and 87% received an automatic payroll contribution in month 12.

Do Patients Value High-Quality Medical Care? Experimental Evidence from Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment,"Carolina Lopez, Anja Sautmann, Simone G. Schaner","Can information about the value of diagnostic tests improve provider practice and help patients recognize higher quality of care? In a randomized experiment at public clinics in Mali,  health providers and patients received tailored information about the importance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria. The provider training increased provider reliance on RDTs, improving the match between a patient's malaria status and treatment with antimalarials by 15-30 percent. Nonetheless, patients were significantly less satisfied with the care they received, driven by those whose prior beliefs did not match their true malaria status. The patient information intervention did not affect treatment outcomes or patient satisfaction and reduced malaria testing. These findings are consistent with highly persistent patient beliefs that translate into low demand for diagnostic testing and limit patients' ability to recognize improved quality of care.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32075,32075,24-Jan,NBER,1/22/2024
Human Capital by Gender: a G20 and Selected Geographies Perspective,"Barbara M.

It focuses on five important aggregates by gender: Asia, Africa, Latin America, G20, and the European Union to highlight differences. Human capital per capita does vary significantly across countries in each aggregate. Education and human capital is unevenly distributed among males and females, although both total and per capita human capital have grown over time in almost all countries.

The Leisure Gains from International Trade,Agustin Velasquez,"The average number of hours worked has been declining in many countries. This can be explained if workers have preferences with income effects outweighing substitution effects. Then, an optimal response to rising income is to reduce labor supply to enjoy more leisure. In this paper, I develop a novel structural link between trade and aggregate labor supply. Using a multi-country Ricardian trade model, I show that reducing trade barriers leads to fewer hours worked while being compatible with an increase in welfare. In addition, I derive an hours-to-trade elasticity and estimate it by exploiting exogenous income variation generated by aggregate trade. On average, I quantify that the rise in trade openness between 1950 and 2014 explains 7 percent of the total decline in hours per worker in high-income countries.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/19/The-Leisure-Gains-from-International-Trade-543871,WPIEA2024016,"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/22/2024

Tariff shocks depress trade, investment, and output persistently. The general equilibrium import elasticity is –0.8. Historically, NAFTA/WTO raised output by 1-3% for twenty years.

"U.S. Monetary Policy Spillovers to Middle East and Central Asia: Shocks, Fundamentals, and Propagations","Giovanni Ugazio, Weining Xin","We empirically examine U.S. monetary policy spillovers to the Middle East and Central Asia (ME & CA) region by decomposing U.S. interest rates changes into two orthogonal shocks: the pure monetary policy shock and the information news shock. Using a sample of 16 ME & CA countries, we find that when interest rates increase, the two shocks have opposite spillovers on the region. Tightening driven by contractionary monetary policy shocks hinders growth, while tightening driven by positive information news shocks boosts growth despite higher interest rates. Countries with weaker fundamentals face more negative spillovers from contractionary monetary policy shocks but may sometimes benefit more from positive information news shocks. Moreover, high oil prices mitigate both spillovers for oil exporters while global risk appetite amplifies both spillovers. Finally, we estimate a large degree of heterogeneity in the impact of the 2022 U.S. tightening cycle on ME & CA countries, with oil exporters with stronger fundamentals withstanding well the shock and oil importers with weaker fundamentals being hit the most.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/19/U-S-542422,WPIEA2024014,"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/22/2024

Inflation heterogeneity across Austrian households. Evidence from household scanner data,"Teresa Messner, Fabio Rumler","It has been widely documented that households experience different inflation rates which are generally concealed in aggregate price indices. Using scanner data from a large household panel for Austria, we analyse price dynamics faced by individual households and try to explain the causes for the observed inflation differences. Considering not only consumption shares but also the specific product prices paid by households, we find a considerable and persistent degree of heterogeneity among household inflation rates. These are also quite variable over time, resulting from varying consumption baskets and active product substitution, allowing households to reduce their inflation exposure substantially. Factors like age and shopping behavior of households explain some of the inflation differences, whereas income does not seem to have a notable influence in normal times. However, during high inflation periods, the lowest income group is found to face higher inflation rates than other income groups.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2894~5fd5d33b3f.en.pdf?4214c17872b1be632a7ea1a6ef6552fc,2894,26-Jan-24,ECB,1/26/2024
A Commitment Rule for Insolvency Forum,"Anthony J. Casey, Aurelio Gurrea-Martínez, Robert K. Rasmussen","In this article, we propose a new rule for determining the proper forum for insolvency proceedings. Currently, the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency—promulgated by United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”)—looks to a debtor’s center of main interest (“COMI”) to determine the proper forum for a foreign main insolvency proceeding. This rule is flawed. It is both inflexible and manipulable. It is also indeterminate and neither requires nor allows advance commitment by debtors. As a result, it leads to uncertainty, increases litigation costs, and opens the door to opportunistic manipulation by debtors. These costs, in turn, raise the cost of credit for all companies.And so, we propose a better approach—the “Commitment Rule”—for the determining proper insolvency forum. In short, the Commitment rule allows debtors to signal an advance commitment to a particular insolvency forum. To make this commitment public and binding, the debtor must put it in their company’s constitution. This upfront and observable commitment eliminates uncertainty and opportunistic manipulation.The Commitment Rule presents a rare “win-win” legal reform requiring no major tradeoff. It would reduce strategic forum shopping and minimize litigation costs while also promoting the development and selection of efficient insolvency forums, which benefit all stakeholders – debtors, creditors and society at large. These improvements support the development of financial markets, entrepreneurial innovation, and economic growth more generally. UNCITRAL should adopt the Commitment Rule as part of the Model Law.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/a-commitment-rule-for-insolvency-forum/,2024-06,25-Jan-24,BFI,1/27/2024

Does FinTech Increase Bank Risk Taking?,"Selim A Elekdag, Drilona Emrullahu, Sami Ben Naceur","Motivated by its rapid growth, this paper investigates how FinTech activities influence risk taking by financial intermediaries (FIs). In this context, this paper revisits an ongoing debate on the impact of competition on financial stability: on one side, it is argued that greater competition encourages greater risk taking (competition-fragility hypothesis), while the other side of the debate asserts that more competition can increase financial stability (competition-stability hypothesis). Using a curated databased covering over 10,000 FIs and global FinTech activities, we find a robust relationship whereby greater FinTech presence is associated with heightened risk taking by FIs, offering support for the competition-fragility hypothesis. However, the inclusion of bank-, industry-, and country-specific characteristics can alter this relationship. Importantly, there is suggestive evidence indicating that in certain cases, greater FinTech presence may be associated with less FI risk taking amid stronger domestic institutions. Notwithstanding the relevance for policy, this paper presents a novel framework that may help reconcile some of the conflicting results in the literature which have found supportive evidence for each of the two competing hypotheses.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/26/Does-FinTech-Increase-Bank-Risk-Taking-544028,WPIEA2024017,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/27/2024
In Search of the Origin of Original Sin Dissipation,"Bada Han, Jangyoun Lee, Taehee Oh","In this paper, we examine how, contrary to the ‘original sin’ hypothesis, emerging market economies have gained the ability to borrow abroad in their local currency. We empirically analyze the relationship of various economic variables with local currency debt and identify three crucial conditions for the capacity to borrow in local currency: institutional quality, sufficient depth in the domestic bond market, and adequate performance in inflation targeting. While shares in JPMorgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) index also appear to be influential, the associations with local currency debt is less clear. We conduct a similar empirical analysis on portfolio equity, which represents a safer form of external liability than foreign currency debt, and verify that the depth of the equity market plays a key role in attracting foreign capital to domestic equity markets. Finally, we propose a simple portfolio model based on the inelastic market hypothesis to explain the positive correlation between capital market depth and the dissipation of original sin, which refers to the presence of more external liability in the form of equity or local currency debt. In essence, our analysis suggests that emerging market economies with reasonably strong fundamentals are not necessarily reliant on foreign currency debt.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/26/In-Search-of-the-Origin-of-Original-Sin-Dissipation-544049,WPIEA2024018,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/27/2024
Deposit market concentration and monetary transmission: evidence from the euro area,Stephen Kho,"I study the transmission of monetary policy to deposit rates in the euro area with a focus on asymmetries and the role of banking sector concentration. Using a local projections framework with 2003-2023 country-level and bank-level data for thirteen euro area member states, I find that deposit rates respond symmetrically to an unexpected tightening or easing of monetary policy. However, more concentrated domestic banking sectors do pass-on unexpected monetary tightening (easing) more slowly (quickly) than less concentrated banking sectors, which contributes to a temporary divergence of deposit rates across the euro area. These results suggest that heterogeneity in the degree of banking sector concentration matters for the transmission of monetary policy to deposit rates, which in turn may affect banking sector profitability.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2896~92bba6983d.en.pdf?da4b3ef23e1577b867b9cdc9e463d089,2896,29-Jan-24,ECB,1/29/2024

Digital Information Provision and Behavior Change: Lessons from Six Experiments in East Africa,"Raissa Fabregas, Michael Kremer, Matthew Lowes, Robert On, Giulia Zane","Mobile phone-based informational programs are widely used worldwide, though there is little consensus on how effective they are at changing behavior. We present causal evidence on the effects of six agricultural information programs delivered through text messages in Kenya and Rwanda. The programs shared similar objectives but were implemented by three different organizations and varied in content, design, and target population. With administrative outcome data for tens of thousands of farmers across all experiments, we are sufficiently powered to detect small effects in real input purchase choices. Combining the results of all experiments through a meta-analysis, we find that the odds ratio for following the recommendations is 1.22 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.29). We cannot reject that impacts are similar across experiments and for two different agricultural inputs. There is little evidence of message fatigue, but the effects diminish over time. Providing more granular information, supplementing the texts with in-person calls, or varying the messages’ framing did not significantly increase impacts, but message repetition had modest positive effects. While the overall effect sizes are small, the low cost of text messages can make these programs cost-effective.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32048,32048,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024

In addition to corroborating previous findings in the literature (hedonic asymmetry/hedonic loss aversion, hedonic adaptation and motivated beliefs), we provide novel results that extend the literature in four dimensions. First, happiness responds to changes relative to both the political status quo (i.e., the incumbent presidential party) and the expected electoral outcome, providing support for two major hypotheses regarding reference point formation. Individuals exhibit hedonic loss aversion to deviations from expectations, but hedonic loss neutrality to changes from the status quo. Second, the speed of hedonic adaptation to deviations from the status quo is significantly slower than the speed of hedonic adaptation to surprises. Third, expectations affect happiness in a nonlinear way, consistent with Gul’s model of disappointment aversion, but contrary to other influential reference-dependent models.

MPAs are Pigouvian-style, polluter-pays, controls with rare direct compensation and uncertain projected fishery benefits. Under this policy design, they impose differential economic costs and benefits and likely are inequitable. Absent economic cost/benefit analysis at inauguration, they may be too large, extensive, and restrictive. In the empirical cases below, MPAs are controversial with political pushback, threatening long-term conservation.

Durables and Size-Dependence in the Marginal Propensity to Spend,"Martin Beraja, Nathan Zorzi","Stimulus checks have become an increasingly important policy tool in recent U.S. recessions. How does the households' marginal propensity to spend (MPX) vary as checks become larger? To quantify this size-dependence in the MPX, we augment a canonical model of durable spending by introducing a smooth adjustment hazard. We discipline this hazard by matching a rich set of micro moments. We find that the MPX declines slowly with the size of checks. In contrast, the MPX is flatter in a purely state-dependent model of durables, and declines sharply in a two-asset model of non-durables. Finally, we embed our spending model into an open-economy heterogeneous-agent New-Keynesian model. In a typical recession, a large check of $2,000 increases output by 25 cents per dollar, compared to 37 cents for a $300 check. Large checks thus remain effective but extrapolating from the response out of small checks overestimates their impact.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32080,32080,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024

The trade-war has not to date provided economic help to the US heartland: import tariffs on foreign goods neither raised nor lowered US employment in newly-protected sectors; retaliatory tariffs had clear negative employment impacts, primarily in agriculture; and these harms were only partly mitigated by compensatory US agricultural subsidies. Consistent with expressive views of politics, the tariff war appears nevertheless to have been a political success for the governing Republican party.

But unlike studies that focus on the United States to understand the effects of migration from poor to rich countries, our context is informative of developing countries' experience because Brazil in this period was unique among major migrant destinations as a low-income country with a large agricultural sector and weak institutions. Instrumenting for a municipality's immigrant share using the interaction of aggregate immigrant inflows and the expansion of Brazil's railway network, we find that a greater immigrant share in a municipality led to an increase in farm values. We show that the bulk of the effect of immigration can be explained by more intense cultivation of land, which we attribute to temporary immigrants exerting greater labor effort than natives. Finally, we find that it is unlikely that immigration's effect on agriculture slowed Brazil's structural transformation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32083,32083,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
The Predictive Power of the Term Spread and Financial Variables for Economic Activity across Countries,"Menzie D. Chinn, Laurent Ferrara","In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the moments of the yield curve (or alternatively, the term spread) as a predictor of future economic activity, defined as either recessions, or industrial production growth. In this paper, we re-examine the evidence for this predictor for the United States, other high-income countries, as well as selected emerging market economies (Brazil, India, China, South Africa and South Korea), over the 1995-2023 period. We examine the sensitivity of the results to the addition of financial variables that measure other dimensions of financial conditions both domestically and internationally.  Specifically, we account for financial conditions indexes (Arrigoni, et al., 2022), the debt service ratio (Borio, et al., 2020), and foreign term spreads (Ahmed and Chinn, 2023). We find that foreign term spreads and the debt service ratio in many cases yield substantially better predictive power, in terms of in-sample fit using proportion of variance explained. Overall, the predictive power of the yield curve, as well as other financial variables, varies across countries, with particularly little explanatory power in emerging market economies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32084,32084,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
Value Chain Microfinance,"Lorenzo Casaburi, Jack Willis","We study the provision of financial services to small firms, consumers, and workers in developing countries as part of value chain relationships: value chain microfinance (VCMF). We first explore how VCMF can both overcome barriers to financial access – including asymmetric information, enforcement, and behavioral biases – and strengthen value chains, but also how it can introduce new challenges. We then review a recent empirical literature at the intersection of value chains and microfinance studying the demand for and effects of VCMF in credit, insurance, and savings markets. We conclude by highlighting promising directions for future work.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32085,32085,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
"The Economic Impact of Heritable Physical Traits: Hot Parents, Rich Kid?","Daniel S. Hamermesh, Anwen Zhang","Since the mapping of the human genome in 2004, biologists have demonstrated genetic links to the expression of several income-enhancing physical traits. To illustrate how heredity produces intergenerational economic effects, this study uses one trait, beauty, to infer the extent to which parents’ physical characteristics transmit inequality across generations. Analyses of a large-scale longitudinal dataset in the U.S., and a much smaller dataset of Chinese parents and children, show that a one standard-deviation increase in parents’ looks is associated with a 0.4 standard-deviation increase in their child’s looks. A large data set of U.S. siblings shows a correlation of their beauty consistent with the same expression of their genetic similarity, as does a small sample of billionaire siblings. Coupling these estimates with parameter estimates from the literatures describing the impact of beauty on earnings and the intergenerational elasticity of income suggests that one standard-deviation difference in parents’ looks generates a 0.06 standard-deviation difference in their adult child’s earnings, which amounts to additional annual earnings in the U.S. of about $2300.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32086,32086,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
Constructing Quarterly Chinese Time Series Usable for Macroeconomic Analysis,"Kaiji Chen, Patrick C.

To explore the primary sources of these fluctuations, we construct a comprehensive dataset of GDP and its components in both nominal and real terms at a quarterly frequency. Applying two SVAR models to this dataset, we uncover the principal drivers of China's economic fluctuations across different episodes.

Energy Transitions in Regulated Markets,"Gautam Gowrisankaran, Ashley Langer, Mar Reguant","Natural gas has replaced coal as the dominant fuel for U.S. electricity generation. However, U.S. states that regulate electric utilities have retired coal more slowly than others. We build a structural model of rate-of-return regulation during an energy transition where utilities face tradeoffs between lowering costs and maintaining coal capacity. We find that the current regulatory structure retires only 45% as much coal capacity as a cost minimizer. A regulated utility facing a carbon tax does not lower carbon emissions immediately but retires coal similarly to the social planner. Alternative regulations with faster transitions clash with affordability and reliability goals.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32088,32088,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
Policy Responses to Tax Competition: An Introduction,"David R. Agrawal, James M. Poterba, Owen M. Zidar","This paper catalogues policies that have been deployed by jurisdictions seeking to mitigate the effects of tax competition.  There are many instruments in this policy arsenal, since the tax base associated with a particular tax instrument may be affected by multiple policy choices, including some such as capital controls and development incentives that are outside the traditional realm of tax policy.   This paper describes sixteen instruments that both federal and sub-federal governments have adopted in an effort to limit tax competition.  It classifies them into three groups: those that can be pursued unilaterally, those that require bilateral or multilateral agreement, and those that require action by an external actor such as an overarching government.  It also discusses the set of economic responses that are relevant to the evaluation of these policies, and then summarizes new evidence on the impact of a subset of these policy instruments in the United States and several other nations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32090,32090,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
Power Flows: Transmission Lines and Corporate Profits,Catherine Hausman,"Economists, energy experts, and policymakers have called for accelerating investment in the U.S. electricity transmission network. Additional transmission lines could better integrate markets, reducing the total cost of electricity generation. They could also allow for the better integration of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, located in areas that traditionally did not have much generation capacity and that are far away from centers of demand. In this paper, I document the magnitude of static allocative inefficiencies induced by transmission congestion in two major U.S. electricity markets. I show that the allocative inefficiencies are rising over time, totaling more than $2 billion in 2022. Moreover, I document an important political economy dimension not yet explored in the literature: the magnitudes of gains and losses from this market integration at some individual firms is surprisingly large: four firms would have experienced a collective $1.6 billion drop in operating profits in 2022 had the market been integrated. I then tie some of these firms to reports of transmission hold-up in these markets. I argue that understanding firm-level gains and losses is just as important as understanding overall inefficiencies, particularly in an environment where incumbents may have the power to block new lines.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32091,32091,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
Convenience Yields and Exchange Rate Puzzles,"Zhengyang Jiang, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Hanno Lustig, Jialu Sun","We introduce safe asset demand for dollar-denominated bonds into a tractable incomplete-market model of exchange rates. The convenience yield on dollar bonds enters as a stochastic wedge in the Euler equations for exchange rate determination. This wedge reduces the pass-through from marginal utility shocks to exchange rate movements, resolving the exchange rate volatility puzzle. The wedge also exposes the dollar's exchange rate to convenience yield shocks, giving rise to exchange rate disconnect from macro fundamentals and a quantitatively important driver of currency risk premium. This endogenous exposure identifies a novel safe-asset-demand channel by which the Fed's QE impacts the dollar and long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32092,32092,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
Cash Transfers for Child Development: Experimental Evidence from India,"Jeffrey Weaver, Sandip Sukhtankar, Paul Niehaus, Karthik Muralidharan","Despite significant economic growth, child development outcomes in India remain poor. Using a large-scale experiment in which randomly-selected mothers receive cash transfers for the first two years of their child's life, we examine the relationship between income and child development in the Indian state of Jharkhand. Treated mothers and children experienced large increases in nutritional intake, including increases in caloric consumption of 9.6-15.5%. However, child anthropometric indicators improved only in areas with low rates of open defecation. These results suggest that poor sanitation is a key explanatory factor for the poor translation of increases in income into child growth in India.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32093,32093,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
Non-Linear Inflation Dynamics in Menu Cost Economies,"Andres Blanco, Corina Boar, Callum J. Jones, Virgiliu Midrigan","Canonical menu cost models, when parameterized to match the micro-price data, cannot reproduce the extent to which the fraction of price changes increases with inflation. They also predict implausibly large menu costs and misallocation in the presence of strategic complementarities. We resolve these shortcomings by extending the multi-product menu cost model along two dimensions. First, the products sold by a firm are imperfect substitutes. Second, strategic complementarities are at the firm, not product level. In contrast to standard models, the fraction of price changes increases rapidly with the size of monetary shocks, so our model implies a non-linear Phillips curve.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32094,32094,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
Do Double Majors Face Less Risk? An Analysis of Human Capital Diversification,"Andrew S. Hanks, Shengjun Jiang, Xuechao Qian, Bo Wang, Bruce A.

Double majors experience substantial protection against earnings shocks, of 56%. This finding holds across different model specifications and data sets. Furthermore, the protection double majors experience is more pronounced when the two majors are more distantly related, highlighting the importance of diverse skill sets. Additional analyses demonstrate that double majors are more likely to work in jobs that require a diverse set of skills and knowledge and are less likely to work in occupations that are closely related to their majors.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32095,32095,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
Intra-Household Insurance and the Intergenerational Transmission of Income Risk,"Francesco Agostinelli, Domenico Ferraro, Xincheng Qiu, Giuseppe Sorrenti","This paper studies the mechanisms and the extent to which parental wage risk passes through to children's skill development. Through a quantitative dynamic labor supply model in which two parents choose whether to work short or long hours or not work at all, time spent with children, and child-related expenditures, we find that income risk impacts skill accumulation, permanently lowering children's skill levels. To the extent that making up for cognitive skill losses during childhood is hard--as available evidence suggests--uninsurable income risk can negatively impact the labor market prospects of future generations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32096,32096,24-Jan,NBER,1/29/2024
The effect of new housing supply in structural models: a forecasting performance evaluation,Stefan Girstmair,"This paper investigates the importance of including data on new housing supply in Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models in forecasting the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), focusing on the U.S. While existing models have added a financial sector and real estate sector, they have largely overlooked housing supply. I develop an extended DSGE model that includes both the financial sector and endogenous housing supply and show that forecasting accuracy significantly improves when data on new houses is included. Robustness checks confirm the importance of these additions to the model. The findings highlight the necessity of combining model extension and housing supply data for accurate forecasting during economic crises. I identify negative housing demand shocks and escalating adjustment costs as primary drivers of the GFC, propagating into the real economy and accelerating through the financial sector. Additionally, this paper addresses the zero lower bound challenge in modeling forward guidance using a regime change approach.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2895~9c686f3def.en.pdf?a2c223df26c4ef1933424fb428d0d436,2895,29-Jan-24,ECB,1/29/2024

The impact of macroeconomic and monetary policy shocks on credit risk in the euro area corporate sector,"Marco Lo Duca, Diego Moccero, Fabio Parlapiano","We analyse the impact of macroeconomic and monetary policy shocks on corporate credit risk as measured by firms’ probabilities of default (PDs) for the four largest euro area countries. We estimate the impact of shocks on one-year PDs using local projections (LP). For the period 2014-19, we find that aggregate shocks significantly affect the dynamics of credit risk. An adverse supply shock leads to a deterioration of firms’ riskiness 10 per cent above the average PD. Contractionary monetary policy shocks exert similar, but delayed effects. Firms’ responses to shocks vary depending on their characteristics and degree of financial constraints. Smaller firms are affected to a larger degree. Firms’ outstanding indebtedness and debt repayment capacity are an important transmission channel for aggregate shocks, but the accumulation of cash reserves helps building resilience.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2897~449ca98c99.en.pdf?f4e4337ea5e33262021b44e35b0d691c,2897,30-Jan-24,ECB,1/30/2024
Blinded Versus Unblinded Review: A Field Study Comparing the Equity of Peer-Review,"Timothy J. Pleskac, Ellie Kyung, Gretchen Chapman, Oleg Urminsky","Blinded review is often proposed as a solution to potential inequities in meritbased evaluations. Yet, an equitable merit-based evaluation should also be reliable and valid. We evaluated the equity of blinded and unblinded review in a high-stakes field experiment during peer-review of submissions for an academic conference. Each conference submission received double-blind peer-reviews with reviewer and author identities withheld and single-blind peer-reviews with only reviewer identities withheld. We found that both systems yielded evaluations with moderate reliability after averaging across three or more independent reviewers. This level of reliability resulted in the review systems agreeing on 40% of the top submissions. This agreement level suggests that some differences between review systems emerge from noisy human judgment. The comparison also revealed that single-blind reviews favored senior coauthors and disfavored Asian (versus White) authors more than double-blind review. Double-blind reviews slightly favored male authors more than single-blind reviews. For submissions selected for presentation, neither author characteristics nor the review process consistently predicted judged talk quality or popularity. Single- and double-blind review scores similarly predicted subsequent publication. These results imply that preferences based on authors’ characteristics during single-blind review were not based on well-calibrated beliefs, and there was no strong evidence to suggest that knowing the authors’ characteristics would improve peerreview. The results also suggest that double-blind review may also reduce the ability of reviewers to take into consideration when submissions are from under-represented groups. We discuss ways blind review may be adapted to create an equitable merit-based evaluation.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/blinded-versus-unblinded-review-a-field-study-comparing-the-equity-of-peer-review/,2024-07,29-Jan-24,BFI,1/31/2024
Digital Information Provision and Behavior Change: Lessons from Six Experiments in East Africa,"Raissa Fabregas, Michael Kremer, Matthew Lowes, Robert On, Giulia Zane","Mobile phone-based informational programs are widely used worldwide, though there is little consensus on how effective they are at changing behavior. We present causal evidence on the effects of six agricultural information programs delivered through text messages in Kenya and Rwanda. The programs shared similar objectives but were implemented by three different organizations and varied in content, design, and target population. With administrative outcome data for tens of thousands of farmers across all experiments, we are sufficiently powered to detect small effects in real input purchase choices. Combining the results of all experiments through a meta-analysis, we find that the odds ratio for following the recommendations is 1.22 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.29). We cannot reject that impacts are similar across experiments and for two different agricultural inputs. There is little evidence of message fatigue, but the effects diminish over time. Providing more granular information, supplementing the texts with in-person calls, or varying the messages’ framing did not significantly increase impacts, but message repetition had modest positive effects.

Physical and transition risk premiums in euro area corporate bond markets,"Joost Victor Bats, Giovanna Bua, Daniel Kapp","The European Union plays a prominent role in climate regulations initiatives, this commitment likely implies that climate risk premiums look different in Europe compared to the rest of the world. This paper examines the pricing implications of climate risks in euro area corporate bond markets, focusing on physical and transition risk. Using climate news as a gauge for systematic climate risk, we find a significant pricing effect of physical risk in long-term bonds, with investors demanding higher returns on bonds exposed to physical risk shocks. The estimated physical risk premium is 34 basis points, indicating increased awareness and hedging demand after the Paris Agreement. Transition risk premiums are smaller and less significant, reflecting the ongoing transition to a low-carbon economy.

Satellites turn “concrete”: tracking cement with satellite data and neural networks,"Alexandre d’Aspremont, Simon Ben Arous, Jean-Charles Bricongne, Benjamin Lietti, Baptiste Meunier","This paper exploits daily infrared images taken from satellites to track economic activity in advanced and emerging countries.

Our algorithm uses the laws of physics (Planck’s law) and machine learning to detect the heat produced by cement plants in activity. This allows us to monitor in real-time whether a cement plant is working. Using this information on around 500 plants, we construct a satellite-based index tracking activity. We show that using this satellite index outperforms benchmark models and alternative indicators for nowcasting the production of the cement industry as well as the activity in the construction sector. Comparing across methods, we find neural networks yields significantly more accurate predictions as they allow to exploit the granularity of our daily and plant-level data.

Asymmetric expectations of monetary policy,Filippo Busetto,"We study the determinants of the asymmetric behaviour of monetary policy expectations in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. A common factor based on macroeconomic data and survey variables has predictive ability above and beyond yield based factors for negative changes in expected rates during an easing cycle, but not for increases in expected rates during a tightening in monetary policy. At the same time, macroeconomic information does not have any asymmetric effect on the conditional distribution of term premia. We complement previous findings on the asymmetric predictability of expected rates by showing that monetary policy easing during crises is predictable.

Optimal Trade Policy with International Technology Diffusion,"Yan Bai, Keyu Jin, Dan Lu, Hanxi Wang","We study optimal dynamic trade policies in an Eaton-Kortum model with technology diffusion through trade. The process of innovation and diffusion is one in which new ideas are combined with insights from others. Trade thus affects technology by determining the distribution from which producers draw their insights. Our theory shows that optimal policies capture a dynamic motive for a country to alter global technology. These policies take into account selection effects, country endowments, and other alterations to trade patterns that affect the degree and quality of diffusion. We provide explicit formulas showing that a Home country would like to subsidize imports from places that improve the quality of learning at Home; or lower its export tax to another country if a) higher productivity in that country is good for the Home, and b) more exports to that country improve the quality of learning and, in turn, the country’s technology.

We collaborate with one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China and study its roll out of a new search tool. When a customer searches for a general term (e.g., “headphones”), the tool suggests refined queries (e.g., “bluetooth headphones” or “noise-canceling headphones”) with the help of images and texts. The search tool was rolled out with a long-run experiment, which allows us to measure its short-run and long-run effects. We find that, although there was no immediate effect on orders or total expenditures, the search tool changed customers’ search and purchasing behavior in the long-run. Customers with access to the new tool eventually increased orders and expenditures compared to those in the control group, especially for non top-selling products.

CEO Compensation and Cash-Flow Shocks: Evidence from Changes in Environmental Regulations,"Seungho Choi, Ross Levine, Raphael Jonghyeon Park, Simon Xu","This paper investigates how shocks to expected cash flows influence CEO incentive compensation. Exploiting changes in compliance with environmental regulations as shocks to expected future cash flows, we find that adverse shocks typically prompt corporate boards to recalibrate CEO compensation to reduce risk-taking incentives. However, this pattern is not uniform. Financially distressed firms exhibit milder reductions in compensation convexity, with some even increasing it, suggesting a “gambling for resurrection” strategy. Moreover, the strength of corporate governance influences shareholders’ capacity to align executive incentives with shareholder risk preferences following unanticipated changes in the stringency of environmental regulations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32101,32101,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
How Learning About Harms Impacts the Optimal Rate of Artificial Intelligence Adoption,Joshua S. Gans,This paper examines recent proposals and research suggesting that AI adoption should be delayed until its potential harms are properly understood. It is shown that conclusions regarding the social optimality of delayed AI adoption are sensitive to assumptions regarding the process by which regulators learn about the salience of particular harms. When such learning is by doing -- based on the real-world adoption of AI -- this generally favours acceleration of AI adoption to surface and react to potential harms more quickly. This case is strengthened when AI adoption is potentially reversible. The paper examines how different conclusions regarding the optimality of accelerated or delayed AI adoption influence and are influenced by other policies that may moderate AI harm.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w32105,32105,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
Copyright Policy Options for Generative Artificial Intelligence,Joshua S. Gans,"New generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, including large language models and image generators, have created new challenges for copyright policy as such models may be trained on data that includes copy-protected content. This paper examines this issue from an economics perspective and analyses how different copyright regimes for generative AI will impact the quality of content generated as well as the quality of AI training. A key factor is whether generative AI models are small (with content providers capable of negotiations with AI providers) or large (where negotiations are prohibitive). For small AI models, it is found that giving original content providers copyright protection leads to superior social welfare outcomes compared to having no copyright protection. For large AI models, this comparison is ambiguous and depends on the level of potential harm to original content providers and the importance of content for AI training quality. However, it is demonstrated that an ex-post `fair use' type mechanism can lead to higher expected social welfare than traditional copyright regimes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32106,32106,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
"Keeping Up with the Jansens: Causal Peer Effects on Household Spending, Beliefs and Happiness","Maarten van Rooij, Olivier Coibion, Dimitris Georgarakos, Bernardo Candia, Yuriy Gorodnichenko","How strong are peer effects on the beliefs and spending decisions of individuals? We use a randomized control study in which treated households are told about either average income or debt of individuals like them to assess how peer effects influence their beliefs and spending. The information treatments are successful at moving respondents’ beliefs about peers’ incomes and debt levels. We find that individuals with exogenously higher perceived relative income become more opposed to redistribution and increase the amount of time they spend socializing with peers. In addition, we find some evidence of reallocative “keeping up with the Joneses” on spending, as those who learn their peers earn more than they thought tend to reallocate their spending toward durable goods and away from non-durables. However, the quantitative magnitude of peer effects on spending is small in the months following the information experiment. Peer effects also matter for labor supply decisions and ex-post employment outcomes. Finally, believing that one earns more than peers causally leads to large positive effects on happiness, above and beyond effects coming from spending more time with peers, changing beliefs about redistribution, or changes in spending patterns.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32107,32107,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
Does Defensive Gun Use Deter Crime?,"John J. Donohue, Alex Oktay, Amy L. Zhang, Matthew Benavides","We study the opposing deterrent and enabling effects of guns carried by law-abiding citizens on violent crime, using the location of shooting ranges as an instrument. Our incident-level data based on admittedly imperfect data from the Gun Violence Archive suggests that defensive gun use (DGU) by crime victims may decrease the probability of their injury or death, while increasing the risk of death or injury by the criminal suspects. However, in the aggregate, higher numbers of defensive gun uses—which proxies for more gun carrying and use—are associated with higher numbers of violent crimes, injuries, and fatalities among victims and suspects alike. We hypothesize that this equilibrium effect arises because more guns being carried and used by citizens produce more incentive and opportunities for criminals to acquire guns, leading to a commensurate increase in the incidence and lethality of crime. In summary, our analysis supports the conclusion that the widespread carrying and use of guns is overall more likely to enable violent crimes than to deter them.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32108,32108,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
Immigration Enforcement and Public Safety,"Felipe M. Gonçalves, Elisa Jácome, Emily K. Weisburst","How does immigration enforcement affect public safety? Heightened enforcement could reduce crime by deterring and incapacitating immigrant offenders or, alternatively, increase crime by discouraging victims from reporting offenses. We study the U.S. Secure Communities program, which expanded interior enforcement against unauthorized immigrants. Using national survey data, we find that the program reduced the likelihood that Hispanic victims reported crimes to police and increased the victimization of Hispanics. Total reported crimes are unchanged, masking these opposing effects. We provide evidence that reduced Hispanic reporting is the key driver of increased victimization. Our findings underscore the importance of trust in institutions as a central determinant of public safety.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32109,32109,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
Lives vs. Livelihoods: The Impact of the Great Recession on Mortality and Welfare,"Amy Finkelstein, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, Frank Schilbach, Jonathan Zhang","We leverage spatial variation in the severity of the Great Recession across the United States to examine its impact on mortality and to explore implications for the welfare consequences of recessions. We estimate that an increase in the unemployment rate of the magnitude of the Great Recession reduces the average, annual age-adjusted mortality rate by 2.3 percent, with effects persisting for at least 10 years. Mortality reductions appear across causes of death and are concentrated in the half of the population with a high school degree or less. We estimate similar percentage reductions in mortality at all ages, with declines in elderly mortality thus responsible for about three-quarters of the total mortality reduction. Recession-induced mortality declines are driven primarily by external effects of reduced aggregate economic activity on mortality, and recession-induced reductions in air pollution appear to be a quantitatively important mechanism. Incorporating our estimates of pro-cyclical mortality into a standard macroeconomics framework substantially reduces the welfare costs of recessions, particularly for people with less education, and at older ages where they may even be welfare-improving.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32110,32110,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
Difference-in-Differences in the Marketplace,"Robert Minton, Casey B. Mulligan","Price theory says that the most important effects of policy and technological change are often found beyond their first point of contact.  This appears opposed to econometric methods that rule out spillovers of one person’s treatment on another’s outcomes.  This paper uses the industry model from price theory to represent the statistical concepts of treatments and controls.  When treated and control observations are in the same market, the controls are indirectly affected by the treatment.  Moreover, even the effect of the treatment on the treated reveals only part of the consequence for the treated of treating the entire market, which is often the parameter of interest.  Marshall’s Laws of Derived Demand provide a guide for empirical work: precise price-theoretic interpretations of the direct and spillover effects of a treatment, the quantitative relationships between them, and how they correspond to the scale and substitution effects emphasized in price theory.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32111,32111,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
Campaigning Against Populism Emotions and Information in Real Election Campaigns,"Cesi Cruz, Julien Labonne, Francesco Trebbi","Populist politicians have leveraged direct connections with voters to win elections worldwide, often using emotional rather than policy appeals. Do these forms of campaigning work for programmatic politicians as well? We partner with a mainstream opposition political party to implement a field experiment during the 2019 Philippine Senatorial election to test the effectiveness of: (i) direct in-person appeals providing policy information; (ii) the addition of an activity designed to engender positive emotion. We show that direct engagement providing policy information increases vote share for the party, even in a clientelistic context. Additionally, while the emotional activity increases engagement with the campaign in the short term, the information-only treatment was more effective. Last, we present evidence that the treatments operated through learning and persuasion channels: treated voters were more likely to know the party, more certain about their knowledge, and gave higher ratings to the party’s quality and proposed policies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32112,32112,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
Information-Constrained Coordination of Economic Behavior,"Guy Aridor, Rava Azeredo da Silveira, Michael Woodford","We analyze a coordination game with information-constrained players. The players' actions are based on a noisy compressed representation of the game's payoffs in a particular case, where the compressed representation is a latent state learned by a variational autoencoder (VAE). Our generalized VAE is optimized to trade off the average payoff obtained over a distribution of possible games against a measure of the congruence between the agent's internal model and the statistics of its environment.  We apply our model to the coordination game in the experiment of Frydman and Nunnari (2023), and show that it offers an explanation for two salient features of the experimental evidence: both the relatively continuous variation in the players' action probabilities with changes in the game payoffs, and the dependence of the degree of stochasticity of players' choices on the range of game payoffs encountered on different trials. Our approach also provides an account of the way in which play should gradually adjust to a change in the distribution of game payoffs that are encountered, offering an explanation for the history-dependent play documented by Arifovic et al.

Evolution of Debt Financing toward Less-Regulated Financial Intermediaries in the United States,"Isil Erel, Eduard Inozemtsev","Nonbank lenders have been playing an increasing role in supplying debt, especially after the Great Recession. How important are the distortions in the greater regulation of banks that differentially limit risk-taking across alternative providers of credit? How might the growing role of nonbanks in credit markets affect financial stability? This selective review addresses these questions and discusses how banks and nonbanks helped provide liquidity to the nonfinancial sector during the COVID-19 pandemic shock. We argue that tighter bank regulation has created incentives for nonbanks to increase their participation in credit markets, a trend that creates concerns about financial stability.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32114,32114,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
Whatever-It-Takes Policymaking during the Pandemic,"Kathryn M.E. Dominguez, Andrea Foschi","Central banks across the globe introduced large-scale asset purchase programs to address the unprecedented circumstances experienced during the pandemic. Many of these programs were announced as open-ended to shock-and-awe market participants and restore confidence in financial markets. This paper examines whether these whatever-it-takes announcements had larger effects than announcements with explicit limits on scale. We use a narrative approach to categorize announcements made by twenty-two central banks, and event study, propensity-score-matching, and local projection methods to measure the short-term effects of policy announcements on exchange rates and sovereign bond yields. We find that on average a central bank's first whatever-it-takes announcement lowers 10-year bond yields by an additional 25 basis points relative to size-limited announcements, suggesting that communication of potential policy scale matters. Our results for yields hold for both advanced and emerging economies, while exchange rates go in opposing directions, muting their response when we group all countries together.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32115,32115,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
How Do Surrogates Make Treatment Decisions for Patients with Dementia? An Experimental Survey Study,"Lauren Hersch Nicholas, Kenneth M. Langa, Scott D. Halpern, Mario Macis","Despite the growing need for surrogate decision-making for older adults, little is known about how surrogates make decisions and whether advance directives would change decision-making. We conducted a nationally representative experimental survey that cross-randomized cognitive impairment, gender, and characteristics of advance care planning among hospitalized older adults through a series of vignettes. Our study yielded three main findings: first, respondents were much less likely to recommend life-sustaining treatments for patients with dementia, especially after personal exposure. Second, respondents were more likely to ignore patient preferences for life-extending treatment when the patient had dementia, and choose unwanted life-extending treatments for patients without dementia. Third, in scenarios where the patient's wishes were unclear, respondents were more likely to choose treatments that matched their own preferences. These findings underscore the need for improved communication and decision-making processes for patients with cognitive impairment and highlight the importance of choosing a surrogate decision-maker with similar treatment preferences.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32116,32116,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
Difference-in-differences with a Continuous Treatment,"Brantly Callaway, Andrew Goodman-Bacon, Pedro H. C.

We show that treatment effect on the treated-type parameters can be identified under a generalized parallel trends assumption that is similar to the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting differences in these parameters across different values of the treatment can be particularly challenging due to selection bias that is not ruled out by the parallel trends assumption. We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular linear two-way fixed-effect (TWFE) specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation procedures that do not suffer from these TWFE drawbacks, and show in an application that they can lead to different conclusions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32117,32117,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024

"The Consequences of Abuse, Neglect and Cyber-bullying on the Wellbeing of the Young","David G. Blanchflower, Alex Bryson","Using cross-sectional data files for the United States we show that difficulties experienced in childhood - so-called Adverse Child Experiences (ACE)s - are strongly and significantly associated with mental health in adulthood. Our evidence is taken from eight Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys from 2009-2023 which contain a special supplement asking respondents to recall abuse in their childhood. We find that poor mental health is on the rise in the United States, particularly among young women. This upward trend among the young is also apparent from the National Health Interview Surveys 1997-2021, the Healthy Minds surveys of 2007-2023 and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) for high school students. We find ACEs are strongly correlated with poor mental health among both the young and older people and the effect is additive. The impact of living with a household member with poor mental health is large relative to other ACEs and is particularly pronounced among younger people. Being bullied, including electronically, is also strongly negatively associated with the wellbeing of high school students. Time spent in front of a screen has been rising over time for the young and has an independent negative impact on their mental health over and above bullying, one which is more pronounced for young women.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32119,32119,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024

Did Violence Against Asian-Americans Rise in 2020? Evidence from a Novel Approach to Measuring Potentially Racially-Motivated Attacks,"Aleksei Knorre, Britte Van Tiem, Aaron Chalfin","Did anti-Asian violence rise after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic? Efforts to answer this question are compromised by the inherent difficulty of measuring racially-motivated crimes as well as concerns that reporting of racially-motivated hate crimes may have changed due to their increased salience during the pandemic. We pursue an alternative approach to studying whether anti-Asian violence rose after March 2020 that addresses each of these concerns. Using data from the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System, we study inter-race violence occurring in public spaces. While public violence declined among all Americans after March 2020, the share of public violence directed at Asian-Americans by people who were previously unknown to them – or were acquaintances – rose more than it did for other Americans. While this relationship did not hold among an auxiliary sample of large US cities, the national evidence is consistent with a modest increase in racially- motivated violence directed towards Asian-Americans.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32121,32121,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
Experimental Estimates of College Coaching on Postsecondary Re-enrollment,"Lesley J.

We conducted a randomized control trial with approximately 8,000 former students in their early- to mid-20s. Half of participants assigned to the treatment group were offered the opportunity to receive coaching services from InsideTrack, with all communication done remotely via phone or video.

The Determinants of Declining Internal Migration,"William W. Olney, Owen Thompson","Internal migration in the United States has declined substantially over the past several decades, which has important implications for individual welfare, macroeconomic adjustments, and other key outcomes. This paper studies the determinants of internal migration and how they have changed over time. We use administrative data from the IRS covering the universe of bilateral moves between every Commuting Zone (CZ) in the country over a 23 year period. This data is linked to information on local wage levels and home prices, and we estimate bilateral migration determinants in rich regression specifications that contain CZ-pair fixed effects. Consistent with theoretical predictions, results show that migration is decreasing with origin wages and destination home prices, and is increasing with destination wages and origin home prices. We then examine the contributions of earnings and home prices to the noted overall decline in internal migration. These analyses show that wages on their own would have led to an increase in migration rates, primarily because migrants are increasingly responsive to high earnings levels in potential destination CZs. However, these wage effects have been more than offset by housing related factors, which have increasingly impeded internal mobility. In particular, migration has become much less responsive to housing prices in the origin CZ, such that many households that would have left in response to high home prices several decades ago now choose to stay.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32123,32123,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024
Credible Numbers: A Procedure for Reporting Statistical Precision in Parameter Estimates,"Nicolas Astier, Frank A.

This practice misses the opportunity to use rounding rules that convey statistical precision. Using insights from the testing statistical hypotheses of equivalence literature, we propose a methodology that only reports decimal digits in a parameter estimate that reject a hypothesis of statistical equivalence. Applying this methodology to all articles published in the American Economic Review between 2000 and 2022, we find that over 60% of the printed digits in coefficient estimates do not convey statistically meaningful information according to our definition of a significant digit. If one additional digit beyond the last significant digit is reported for each coefficient estimate, then approximately one-third of the printed digits in our sample would not be reported.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32124,32124,24-Feb,NBER,2/5/2024

We find that weaker capitalised banks adjust their credit standards more than healthier banks, especially for firms with a higher default risk. We also show how credit standards change in reaction to two specific macroeconomic developments, namely an increase in bank funding costs and a sudden deterioration in banks’ corporate loan portfolios. Here we find that weaker banks respond more forcefully by tightening their credit standards more than better capitalised banks. This development is particularly pronounced when banks are linked to riskier firms.

Explaining the Life Cycle of Bank-Sponsored Money Market Funds: An Application of the Regulatory Dialectic,"Stefan A. Jacewitz, Jonathan Pogach, Haluk Unal and Chengjun Wu","In this paper, we present empirical evidence of the regulatory dialectic in the prime institutional money market fund (PI-MMF) industry. The “regulatory dialectic”, developed by Kane (1977, 1981), describes how banks and regulators react to each other. For decades, a cap on commercial deposit interest rates fueled dramatic growth in bank-sponsored PI-MMFs as a form of shadow banking. During the growth period, banks with more commercial deposits were more likely to enter the PI-MMF industry in an effort to keep their commercial customers in affiliated subsidiaries. However, the 2008 crisis and subsequent regulatory changes halted the rapid growth of PI-MMFs. In the post-crisis regulatory regime, bank-sponsored funds were more likely to exit the industry than nonbank-sponsored funds. Simultaneously, the industry shifted from PI-MMFs to government institutional MMFs as substitute products. We conjecture that the collapse of the PI-MMF can lead further to the emergence of substitute products, such as stablecoins as part of the continuing dialectical process.",https://doi.org/10.18651/RWP2024-01,2024-01,2/5/2024,FED-KANSASCITY,2/5/2024
ASAP: A Conceptual Model for Digital Asset Platforms,"Victor Budau, Herve Tourpe","This working paper inaugurates the ""Technology Fundamentals for Digital Finance"" series, concentrating on the technical aspects of financial Digital Assets. The series aims to facilitate the use of a clear terminology in a nascent platform-oriented paradigm of financial infrastructures, by laying the groundwork for technical discussions on digital asset standards. The paper introduces a conceptual model named ASAP (Access, Service, Asset, Platform) for Digital Asset Platforms (DAP), leveraging insights from IT industry practices and experiments by central banks. The ASAP model is illustrated through examples and use cases of tokenized assets, to demonstrate the possible usage and merits of modeling Digital Asset Platforms with four layers. Just as the utilization of a seven-layer model (often refered to as TCP/IP) has been fundamental to the interoperability of the internet, it is anticipated that the four-layer ASAP model for Digital Asset Platforms will similarly promote cross-platform interoperability, including across various jurisdictions, paving the way for a more cohesive digital asset ecosystem.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/02/ASAP-A-Conceptual-Model-for-Digital-Asset-Platforms-544387,WPIEA2024019,"Fri, 02 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/5/2024
Geopolitics and International Trade: The Democracy Advantage,Serhan Cevik,"Do political regimes determine how geopolitics influence international trade? This paper provides an empirical answer to the question by analyzing the joint impact of democracy and geopolitical distance between countries with an augmented gravity model of bilateral trade flows and an extensive dataset of more than 4 million observations on 59,049 country-pairs over the period 1948–2018. Implementing the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood regression and the two-stage least squares with instrumental variable approach, I find that geopolitical developments are not as important as income and geographical distance in determining bilateral trade flows and that democracy fosters international trade and moderates the potential negative impact of geopolitics. While the impact of democracy and its interaction with geopolitical distance are significant across all countries, the magnitude of these effects is substantially larger in advanced economies than in developing countries, reflecting the greater strength of democratic institutions, on average, in advanced economies.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/02/Geopolitics-and-International-Trade-The-Democracy-Advantage-544393,WPIEA2024021,"Fri, 02 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/5/2024
Is Schumpeter Right? Fintech and Economic Growth,Serhan Cevik,"The rise of fintech is revolutionizing the financial landscape, with products and companies advancing innovative technologies to improve and automate financial services. In this paper, I use a novel dataset and implement a dynamic modelling to investigate the relationship between fintech and economic growth in a panel of 198 countries over the period 2012–2020. This cross-country approach—utilizing direct measures of fintech and dealing with potential endogeneity—provides interesting empirical insights. First, the impact magnitude and statistical significance of fintech on real GDP per capita growth depend on the type of instrument (digital lending vs. digital capital raising). While digital lending has a statistically significant positive effect on economic growth, digital capital raising has a large but insignificant effect. Second, the overall impact of fintech including all instruments is positive and statistically significant because of the overwhelming share of digital lending in total. Finally, while the positive relationship between fintech and growth is stronger in magnitude in advanced economies, the statistical significance of this effect is higher in developing countries. Taken as a whole, these results confirm Schumpeter’s prediction that financial innovation can promote growth, but not every type of fintech becomes an accelerator.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/02/Is-Schumpeter-Right-Fintech-and-Economic-Growth-544390,WPIEA2024020,"Fri, 02 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/5/2024
The Housing Supply Channel of Monetary Policy,"Bruno Albuquerque, Martin Iseringhausen, Frederic Opitz","We study the role of regional housing markets in the transmission of US monetary policy. Using a FAVAR model over 1999q1–2019q4, we find sizeable heterogeneity in the responses of US states to a
contractionary monetary policy shock. Part of this regional variation is due to differences in housing supply elasticities, household debt overhang, and housing wealth (volatility). Our analysis indicates that house prices and consumption respond more in supply-inelastic states and in states with large household debt imbalances, where negative housing wealth effects bite more strongly and borrowing constraints become more binding. Moreover, financial stability risks increase sharply in these areas as mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures surge, worsening banks’ balance sheets. Finally, monetary policy may have a stronger effect on housing tenure decisions in supply-inelastic states, where the homeownership rate and price-to-rent ratios decline by more. Our findings stress the importance of regional housing supply conditions in assessing the macrofinancial effects of rising interest rates.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/02/The-Housing-Supply-Channel-of-Monetary-Policy-544046,WPIEA2024023,"Fri, 02 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/5/2024
Who Pays the Bill? Distributional and Fiscal Consequences of Elevated Inflation in Thailand,"Piyaporn Chote, Corinne C Delechat, Thanaphol Kongphalee, Vatsal Nahata, Mouhamadou Sy, Pym Manopimoke, Tamon Yungvichit","This paper analyzes the distributional impacts of inflation in Thailand. For that aim, the paper uses rich micro-survey data on 46,000 Thai households to study the effect of the recent elevated inflation on poverty, its distributional effects on different income levels, and the fiscal cost to compensate households from real income losses. To study the multidimensional impact of inflation, the paper also studies how inflation differentially affects households through the consumption, income, and wealth channel. The analysis shows that under a baseline scenario, poverty in Thailand could increase by 1.3 percentage points—about 900,000 people—in the absence of government intervention.

However, fiscal support to compensate relatively rich households, defined as those above the median of the income distribution, amount to 1.4 percent of GDP.

Households' response to the wealth effects of inflation,"Philip Schnorpfeil, Michael Weber, Andreas Hackethal","We study the redistributive effects of surprise inflation combining administrative bank data with an information provision experiment during an episode of historic inflation. On average, households are well-informed about prevailing inflation and are concerned about its impact on their wealth; yet, while many households know about inflation eroding nominal assets, most are unaware of nominal-debt erosion. Once they receive information on the debt-erosion channel, households view nominal debt more positively and increase estimates of their own real net wealth. These changes causally affect actual consumption and hypothetical debt decisions. Our findings suggest that real wealth mediates the sensitivity of consumption to inflation once households are aware of the wealth effects of inflation",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2904~27941cd33f.en.pdf?776183def8a282e91ee6bb36d0805b00,2904,8-Feb-24,ECB,2/8/2024
The macroeconomic effects of global supply chain reorientation,"Daragh Clancy, Donal Smith, Vilém Valenta","Policymakers around the world are encouraging the local production of key inputs to reduce risks from excessive dependencies on foreign suppliers. We analyse the macroeconomic effects of supply chain reorientation through localisation policies, using a global dynamic general equilibrium model. We proxy non-tariff measures, such as the stricter enforcement of regulatory standards, which reduce import quantity but do not directly alter costs and prices. These measures have, so far, been a key component of attempts to reshore production and are an increasingly popular trade policy instrument in general. Focusing on the euro area, we find that localisation policies are inflationary, imply transition costs and generally have a negative long-run effect on aggregate domestic output. The size (and sign) of the impact depends on whether these policies are implemented unilaterally or induce a retaliation from trade partners, and the extent to which they reduce domestic competition and productivity. We provide some recommendations for policymakers considering implementing a localisation agenda.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2903~8bc715c800.en.pdf?8efb3f8dd076fa477fa190805c56946d,2903,8-Feb-24,ECB,2/8/2024

Difference-in-Differences in the Marketplace,"Robert Minton, Casey Mulligan","Price theory says that the most important effects of policy and technological change are often found beyond their first point of contact. This appears opposed to econometric methods that rule out spillovers of one person’s treatment on another’s outcomes. This paper uses the industry model from price theory to represent the statistical concepts of treatments and controls. When treated and control observations are in the same market, the controls are indirectly affected by the treatment. Moreover, even the effect of the treatment on the treated reveals only part of the consequence for the treated of treating the entire market, which is often the parameter of interest. Marshall’s Laws of Derived Demand provide a guide for empirical work: precise price-theoretic interpretations of the direct and spillover effects of a treatment, the quantitative relationships between them, and how they correspond to the scale and substitution effects emphasized in price theory.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/difference-in-differences-in-the-marketplace/,2024-12,5-Feb-24,BFI,2/9/2024
Experimental Estimates of College Coaching on Postsecondary Re-enrollment,"Lesley Turner, Oded Gurantz","College attendance has increased significantly over the last few decades, but dropout rates remain high, with fewer than half of all adults ultimately obtaining a postsecondary credential.

We conducted a randomized control trial with approximately 8,000 former students in their early- to mid-20s. Half of participants assigned to the treatment group were offered the opportunity to receive coaching services from InsideTrack, with all communication done remotely via phone or video.

We leverage exogenous variation across Colombian municipalities in exposure to a fiscal rule that limits the operating expenditures of local governments. Our difference-in-differences analysis yields three main findings. First, the fiscal rule is highly ef-fective at reducing operating expenditures and the probability of a current deficit. Second, there is no meaningful impact on local public goods or living standards. Third, the fiscal consolida-tion leads voters to be more satisfied with their local government and to re-elect the incumbent party at higher rates. These findings suggest that fiscal rules can reduce waste in public ad-ministration and can help to align fiscal policy with the preferences of voters in settings, like Colombia, with weak political parties and limited career concerns for local politicians.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/fiscal-rules-austerity-in-public-administration-and-political-accountability-evidence-from-a-natural-experiment-in-colombia/,2024-10,2-Feb-24,BFI,2/9/2024
Competing models of the Bank of England’s liquidity auctions: truthful bidding is a good approximation,Charlotte Grace,"This paper provides a method for comparing the performance of different models of bidding behaviour. It uses data on participants’ bids but does not require data on their values. I find that a model of ‘truthful bidding’ – bidding one’s true value for liquidity – outperforms a conventional model in which bidders shade their bids to maximise their expected surpluses, in the Bank of England’s uniform-price divisible-good liquidity auctions. I provide two possible explanations for this result. First, when bidders are sufficiently risk averse, optimal strategies in the conventional model approximate truthful bidding. For the conventional model, I develop new identifying conditions which allow for risk aversion. I find that the degree of risk aversion required for truthful bidding to be approximately optimal is consistent with that found in studies that are the most similar to my setting. Second, the optimal strategy can be complicated. Truthful bidding is preferable, even for risk neutral bidders, if the cost of calculating what would otherwise be the optimal strategy exceeds around 5% of bidder surplus.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/competing-models-of-the-bank-of-englands-liquidity-auctions,1061,"Fri, 09 Feb 2",BOE,2/9/2024
Lives vs. Livelihoods: The Impact of the Great Recession on Mortality and Welfare,"Amy Finkelstein, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, Frank Schilbach, Jonathan Zhang","We leverage spatial variation in the severity of the Great Recession across the United States to examine its impact on mortality and to explore implications for the welfare consequences of recessions. We estimate that an increase in the unemployment rate of the magnitude of the Great Recession reduces the average, annual age-adjusted mortality rate by 2.3 percent, with effects persisting for at least 10 years. Mortality reductions appear across causes of death and are concentrated in the half of the population with a high school degree or less. We estimate similar percentage reductions in mortality at all ages, with declines in elderly mortality thus responsible for about three-quarters of the total mortality reduction. Recession-induced mortality declines are driven primarily by external effects of reduced aggregate economic activity on mortality, and recession-induced reductions in air pollution appear to be a quantitatively important mechanism. Incorporating our estimates of pro-cyclical mortality into a standard macroeconomics framework substantially reduces the welfare costs of recessions, particularly for people with less education, and at older ages where they may even be welfare-improving.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/lives-vs-livelihoods-the-impact-of-the-great-recession-on-mortality-and-welfare/,2024-14,5-Feb-24,BFI,2/9/2024

Global value chains and the dynamics of UK inflation,"Tommaso Aquilante, Aydan Dogan, Melih Firat and Aditya Soenarjo","This paper explores the link between the UK’s participation in global value chains (GVCs) and inflation dynamics. Using sectoral data, we find evidence indicating that UK industries with higher proportions of imported inputs from emerging market economies (EMEs) exhibit a flatter Phillips curve. We then build a two-country model with input-output linkages and demonstrate analytically that an increased reliance on imported intermediate goods, serving as a proxy for GVCs, results in a flatter Phillips curve. Additionally, GVC integration affects inflation dynamics through the influence of cyclical forces that shape firms’ marginal costs via terms of trade fluctuations. Specifically, we highlight how the limited business cycle correlation between the UK economy and EMEs reduces the pass-through of domestic shocks to prices.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/global-value-chains-and-the-dynamics-of-uk-inflation,1060,"Fri, 09 Feb 2",BOE,2/9/2024
The Causal Effects of Global Supply Chain Disruptions on Macroeconomic Outcomes: Evidence and Theory,"Xiwen Bai, Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Yiliang Li, Francesco Zanetti","We study the causal effects and policy implications of global supply chain disruptions. We construct a new index of supply chain disruptions from the mandatory automatic identification system data of container ships, developing a novel spatial clustering algorithm that determines real-time congestion from the position, speed, and heading of container ships in major ports around the globe. We develop a model with search frictions between producers and retailers that links spare productive capacity with congestion in the goods market and the responses of output and prices to supply chain shocks. The co-movements of output, prices, and spare capacity yield unique identifying restrictions for supply chain disturbances that allow us to study the causal effects of such disruptions. We document how supply chain shocks drove inflation during 2021 but that, in 2022, traditional demand and supply shocks also played an important role in explaining inflation.

We use recently linked U.S. census data to document three main facts: (i) declining demand for middle-skilled labor in manufacturing corresponded to greater reallocation of workers into comparatively less-skilled occupations; (ii) older workers were more likely to switch to unskilled physical labor; (iii) younger workers led switching into growing occupations affected by automation technologies.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-01,2024-01,24-Feb,FED-CHICAGO,2/9/2024

We study how firms respond to privacy laws in the context of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by using seven years of data from a large global cloud-computing provider. Our difference-in-difference estimates indicate that, in response to the GDPR, EU firms decreased data storage by 26% and data processing by 15% relative to comparable U.S. firms, becoming less “data-intensive.” To estimate the costs of the GDPR for firms, we propose and estimate a production function where data and computation serve as inputs to the production of “information.” We find that data and computation are strong complements in production and that firm responses are consistent with the GDPR representing a 20% increase in the cost of data on average. Variation in the firm-level effects of the GDPR and industry-level exposure to data, however, drives significant heterogeneity in our estimates of the impact of the GDPR on production costs.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-02,2024-02,24-Feb,FED-CHICAGO,2/9/2024

Interest Rate Risk at US Credit Unions,"Grant Rosenberger, Peter Zimmerman","Rising interest rates have prompted concerns about losses on bank assets, especially following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023. In this working paper, we examine whether US credit unions could be subject to similar losses as banks and analyze how their regulatory capital would be affected. We estimate that after realizing losses from assets that have decreased in value and not yet been sold the overall net worth of the credit union industry would have fallen by 40 percent in 2023:Q1. Unrealized losses were most severe at the largest credit unions. Nonetheless, the bulk of deposits at credit unions were insured, suggesting limited risk of an SVB-style run. In addition, credit union deposit rates are relatively insensitive to market interest rates, providing credit unions with a hedge against a rising rate environment. Overall, credit unions’ balance sheet positions seemed to be more resilient to unrealized interest rate risk than banks’.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2403-interest-rate-risk-at-us-credit-unions,24-03,02.05.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,2/9/2024
Carbon Prices and Inflation in the Euro Area,"Maximilian Konradt, Thomas McGregor, Frederik G Toscani","What is the effect of carbon pricing on inflation? This paper shows empirically that the consequences of the European Union’s Emission Trading System (ETS) and national carbon taxation on inflation have been limited in the euro area, so far. This result is supported by analysis based on a panel local projections approach, as well as event studies based on individual countries. Our estimates suggest that carbon taxes raised the price of energy but had limited effects on overall consumer prices. Since future climate policy will need to be much more ambitious compared to what has been observed so far, including the need for larger increases in carbon prices, possible non-linearities might make extrapolating from historical results difficult. We thus also use input-output tables to simulate the mechanical effect of a carbon tax consistent with the EU’s ‘Fit-for-55’ commitments on inflation. The required increase of effective carbon prices from around 40 Euro per ton of CO2 in 2021 to around 150 Euro by 2030 could raise annual euro area inflation by between 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points. It is worth noting that the energy price increases caused by the rise in the effective carbon price to 150 Euro is substantially smaller than the energy price spike seen in 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/09/Carbon-Prices-and-Inflation-in-the-Euro-Area-544465,WPIEA2024027,"Fri, 09 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/9/2024

Using transaction-by-transaction derivatives data, we assess whether the current levels of funds’ holdings of cash and other highly liquid assets would be adequate to meet funds’ liquidity needs to cover variation margin calls on derivatives under a range of stress scenarios. The estimates indicate that between 13 percent and 33 percent of euro area funds with sizeable derivatives exposures may not have sufficient liquidity buffers to meet the calls under adverse market shocks. As a result, they are likely to redeem money market fund (MMF) shares, procyclically sell assets, and draw on credit lines, thus amplifying the market dynamics under such stress scenarios.

Using micro-level data from the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, we show that the distribution of consumer expectations at one-year and five-ten year horizons has widened since the surge of inflation during 2021, along with the mean. Persistently high and heterogeneous expectations of consumers with less education and lower income are mainly responsible. A simple model of adaptive learning is able to mimic the change in inflation expectations over time for different demographic groups. The inflation expectations of low income and female consumers are consistent with using less complex forecasting models and are more backward-looking. A medium-scale DSGE model with adaptive learning, estimated during 1965-2022, has a time-varying solution that produces lower forecast errors for inflation than a variant with rational expectations.

Declining Responsiveness at the Establishment Level: Sources and Productivity Implications,"Russell Cooper, John C.

Evidence shows that an important component of this decline is accounted for by the reduction in the response of employment to shocks in US establishments.  Using a plant level dynamic optimization problem as a framework for analysis, four potential reasons for this decline are studied: (i) a change in exogenous processes for profits, (ii) an increase in impatience, (iii) increased market power and (iv) increasing adjustment costs. We identify and quantity the contribution of each of these factors building on  a simulated method of moments estimation of our structural model.  Our results indicate that the reduction in responsiveness largely reflects increased costs of employment adjustment. Changes in market power, as captured by changes in the curvature of the revenue, function play a minimal role.  But, in the presence of rising adjustment costs, measured sales-weighted markups using the recently popular indirect production approach rise substantially, along with rising dispersion and skewness of such measured markups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32130,32130,24-Feb,NBER,2/12/2024

Those growing more concerned rebalance their retirement portfolios toward climate-friendly mutual funds; those growing less concerned rebalance out of these funds, but to a smaller degree. Financial sophistication and inertia interacts with political polarization in driving these effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32131,32131,24-Feb,NBER,2/12/2024

What Drives U.S. Import Price Inflation?,"Mary Amiti, Oleg Itskhoki, David Weinstein","Inflation has risen sharply in many countries since the COVID-19 outbreak. Economists have debated the underlying causes. In this paper, we examine the drivers of the global import price inflation, which peaked at approximately 11 percent a year. We find that a common global component closely tracks movements in aggregate U.S. import prices until late 2022. Afterward, idiosyncratic U.S. demand shocks started to dominate.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32133,32133,24-Feb,NBER,2/12/2024
Behavioral Responses to Wealth Taxation: Evidence from Colombia,"Juliana Londoño-Vélez, Javier Avila-Mahecha","We study behavioral responses to personal wealth taxes in Colombia. We utilize tax microdata from 1993 to 2016 linked with the leaked Panama Papers to investigate offshoring to the country’s key tax havens. We leverage variation from discrete jumps in tax liability and four major reforms to the wealth tax system, including changes in tax rates and duration, using bunching and difference-in-difference techniques. We find compelling evidence that taxpayers instantly reduce the wealth they declare in response to a wealth tax. Moreover, these effects can persist for years even after the wealth tax is no longer in place, providing the first evidence of a hysteresis effect for a temporary tax policy. The response is driven by misreporting items that authorities cannot cross-verify, such as overstating debt and understating non-third-party-reported business assets. Additionally, the wealthiest taxpayers respond to wealth tax increases by hiding assets in hard-to-track entities in tax havens.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32134,32134,24-Feb,NBER,2/12/2024
"Discrete Choice, Complete Markets, and Equilibrium","Simon Mongey, Michael E. Waugh","This paper characterizes the allocations that emerge in general equilibrium economies populated by households with preferences of the additive random utility type that make discrete consumption, employment or spatial decisions. We start with a complete markets economy where households can trade claims contingent upon the realizations of their preference shocks. We (i) establish a first and second welfare theorem, (ii) illustrate that in the absence of ex-ante trade, discrete choice economies are generically inefficient, (iii) show that complete markets are not necessary and a much smaller set of securities decentralizes the efficient allocation. We illustrate the relevance of these results in several canonical settings and for measuring how welfare changes in response to changes in prices.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32135,32135,24-Feb,NBER,2/12/2024
The Government Patent Register: A New Resource for Measuring U.S. Government-Funded Patenting,"Daniel P. Gross, Bhaven N.

In addition to the funding agency, the data report whether the government has title to the patent (“title” patents) or funded a patent assigned to a private organization (“license” patents). The data include a large number of “license” patents that cannot be linked to government funding from patent text or other sources. Combining the historical data with modern administrative sources, we present a public, consolidated data series measuring U.S. government-funded patents—including funding agencies—through 2020, and we provide code to extend this series in the future.

Monetary Policy Wedges and the Long-term Liabilities of Households and Firms,"Jules H. van Binsbergen, Marco Grotteria","We examine the transmission of monetary policy shocks to the long-duration liabilities of households and firms using high-frequency variation in 10-year swap rates around FOMC announcements. We find that four weeks after the announcement mortgage rates move one-for-one with 10-year swap rates, leaving little explanatory power for mortgage concentration, bank market power, or credit risk. Variation in credit risk does materially affect monetary policy transmission to corporate bonds. Expected future short rates and term premia play a significant role in driving both mortgage rates and corporate bond yields, which explains the Federal Reserve’s increased focus on these quantities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32137,32137,24-Feb,NBER,2/12/2024
Tariff Rate Uncertainty and the Structure of Supply Chains,"Sebastian Heise, Justin R. Pierce, Georg Schaur, Peter K.

Empirically, we introduce a method for distinguishing between these Japanese versus spot-market (i.e., American) relationships in customs data, show that their use varies intuitively across trading partners and products, and find that Japanese importing from China increases after a reduction in the possibility of a trade war. Extending the standard general equilibrium trade model to encompass potential trade wars and relational contracts, we estimate that eliminating Japanese procurement reduces welfare about a third as much as moving to autarky.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32138,32138,24-Feb,NBER,2/12/2024
Out-group Penalties in Refugee Assistance: A Survey Experiment,"Cristina Cattaneo, Daniela Grieco, Nicola Lacetera, Mario Macis","We study out-group biases in attitudes toward refugees, and the effect of European Union (EU) immigration policies on these views, using an online survey experiment including 4,087 Italian participants. We assess attitudes using donations to a randomly assigned group: Italian victims of violence or refugees fleeing wars in Ukraine or African countries. We also employ a novel measure, the share donated in cash. While donations indicated less support for African and Ukrainian refugees compared to Italian victims, the cash measure revealed a stronger prejudice against distant out-groups, with participants giving African refugees a smaller proportion of cash donations. This result was mainly driven by individuals with right-leaning political views. Providing information about immigration policy reforms that give the EU a more substantial role in receiving and allocating refugees had no impact.

Applying AI to Rebuild Middle Class Jobs,David Autor,"While the utopian vision of the current Information Age was that computerization would flatten economic hierarchies by democratizing information, the opposite has occurred. Information, it turns out, is merely an input into a more consequential economic function, decision-making, which is the province of elite experts. The unique opportunity that AI offers to the labor market is to extend the relevance, reach, and value of human expertise. Because of AI’s capacity to weave information and rules with acquired experience to support decision-making, it can be applied to enable a larger set of workers possessing complementary knowledge to perform some of the higher-stakes decision-making tasks that are currently arrogated to elite experts, e.g., medical care to doctors, document production to lawyers, software coding to computer engineers, and undergraduate education to professors. My thesis is not a forecast but an argument about what is possible: AI, if used well, can assist with restoring the middle-skill, middle-class heart of the US labor market that has been hollowed out by automation and globalization.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32140,32140,24-Feb,NBER,2/12/2024

I develop a quantitative spatial model in which labor market competitiveness depends on the demographic composition of the local workforce. Using highly disaggregated administrative data from Germany, I find that firms have more labor market power over older workers: The labor supply elasticity decreases from more than 2 to 1 from age 20 to 64. Calibrating the model with the reduced-form elasticity estimates, I find that differences in labor supply elasticities across age groups can explain 4% of the urban wage premium and 2% of the spatial concentration of population.

Gas price shocks and euro area inflation,"Jakob Feveile Adolfsen, Massimo Ferrari Minesso, Jente Esther Mork, Ine Van Robays","This paper develops a Bayesian VAR model to identify three structural shocks driving the European gas market: demand, supply and inventory shocks. We document how gas price fluctuations have a heterogeneous pass-through to euro area prices depending on the underlying shock driving them. The pass-through is stronger and more persistent when gas prices are driven by aggregate demand or supply pressures, while inventory shocks have a weaker impact. Supply shocks, moreover, are found to pass through to all components of euro area inflation – producer prices, wages and core inflation, which has implications for monetary policy. We finally document how the response of gas prices to shocks is non-linear and is significantly magnified in periods of low unemployment.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2905~6b246d6bf4.en.pdf?63cb42b272005874a9c7649b5cebd636,2905,12-Feb-24,ECB,2/12/2024
"Hold-Up, Innovation, and Platform Governance",Ethan Bueno de Mesquita,"Motivated by large digital platforms, I study a model of platforms choosing fees, upgrades, and governance to compete over a two-sided market of producers and consumers. By solving an interoperability-driven hold-up problem, governance increases producer investment in product quality; however, by preventing fee adjustments, it causes platforms to under-invest in upgrades. This trade-oﬀ persists even if platforms choose their preferred level of interoperability, which is higher without governance than with. When governance is necessary for producers to invest in quality, platforms under-provide governance relative to the social optimum. However, when producers invest in quality regardless of governance, platforms over-provide governance.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/hold-up-innovation-and-platform-governance/,2024-16,12-Feb-24,BFI,2/13/2024

Persuasion and Dissuasion in Political Campaigns: Political Communication and Media Coverage in Senate Races,"Camilo Garcia-Jimeno, Pinar Yildirim","We study the strategic interaction between candidates to office and the print media, exploring the following tension: while the media is instrumental for candidates to communicate with voters, candidates and media outlets have conflicting preferences over the contents of media reporting. We propose a model of bipartisan races where candidates make decisions over the type of constituencies to target with their statements along the campaign trail and media outlets make decisions over how intensely to report about the candidates based on those statements. Different kinds of media reports may persuade or dissuade voters. We develop a methodology to classify news content as suggestive of the target audience of candidate speech, and show how data on media reports and poll results, together with the behavioral implications of the model, can be used to estimate its parameters. We implement this methodology on U.S. Senatorial races for the period 1980-2012, and find that Democratic candidates had stronger incentives to target their messages towards turning out their core supporters than Republicans. We also find that the cost in swing-voter support from targeting core supporters was larger for Democrats than for Republicans.

Managing the transition to central bank digital currency,"Katrin Assenmacher, Massimo Ferrari Minesso, Arnaud Mehl, Maria Sole Pagliari","We develop a two-country DSGE model with financial frictions to study the transition from a steady-state without CBDC to one in which the home country issues a CBDC. The CBDC provides households with a liquid, convenient and storage-cost free means of payments which reduces the market power of banks on deposits. In the steady-state CBDC unambiguously improves welfare without disintermediating the banking sector. But macroeconomic volatility in the transition period to the new steady-state increases for plausible values of the latter. Demand for CBDC and money overshoot, thereby crowding out bank deposits and leading to initial declines in investment, consumption and output. We use non-linear solution methods with occasionally binding constraints to explore how alternative policies reduce volatility in the transition, contrasting the effects of restrictions on non-residents, binding caps, tiered remuneration and central bank asset purchases. Binding caps reduce disintermediation and output losses in the transition most effectively, with an optimal level of around 40% of steady-state CBDC demand.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2907~99a3b6f7cc.en.pdf?ad4e85eae56c3d42d3be772058ff2266,2907,13-Feb-24,ECB,2/14/2024

Uninsurable Income Risk and the Welfare Effects of Reducing Global Imbalances,"Ayşe Dur, Andrew Glover and Jacek Rothert","We highlight the welfare effect of policies that balance global current accounts when households face uninsurable income risk and borrowing constraints. Subsidizing savings in debtor economies reduces current account imbalances and raises the welfare of almost all citizens by increasing world capital, raising wages, and improving insurance for low-wealth households. The same balancing of current accounts is achieved by taxing savings in lender economies; however, this policy hurts most households by reducing global capital. These results suggest that balancing global imbalances may be a positive byproduct of raising investment rates, especially in debtor countries.",https://doi.org/10.18651/RWP2024-02,2024-02,2/14/2024,FED-KANSASCITY,2/14/2024
Mortgage borrowing limits and house prices: evidence from a policy change in Ireland,Brian E.

The policy introduced limits to the loan-to-income and loan-to-value ratios of new mortgages issued. In response to a tightening borrowing constraint, borrowers can choose to purchase a cheaper house or to reduce the leverage (LTV) of the mortgage. Using a difference-in-difference methodology, I find that groups of (poorer) borrowers, who were more likely to be above the loan-to-income threshold before the policy, responded primarily by buying cheaper houses after the policy change. On the other hand, groups of (richer) borrowers, who were more likely to be above the loan-to-value threshold, responded primarily by reducing the LTV of the mortgage. Borrowers who purchase cheaper houses could be buying smaller houses or the same size houses at a lower equilibrium price.

A cohesive social structure facilitates this task, as reliable information will often come from friends and acquaintances. A cohesive citizenry can more easily exercise collective action to resist such intrusions, however. We present an equilibrium theory where this tension mediates the joint determination of social structure and civil liberties. We show that segregation and unequal treatment sustain each other as coordination failures: citizens choose to segregate along the lines of an arbitrary trait only when the government exercises unequal treatment as a function of the trait, and the government engages in unequal treatment only when citizens choose to segregate based on the trait. We characterize when unequal treatment against a minority or a majority can be sustained, and how equilibrium social cohesiveness and civil liberties respond to the arrival of widespread surveillance technologies, shocks to collective perceptions about the likelihood of threats or the importance of privacy, or to community norms such as codes of silence.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-05,2024-05,24-Feb,FED-CHICAGO,2/15/2024

Carbon Prices and Inflation in the Euro Area,"Maximilian Konradt, Thomas McGregor, Frederik G Toscani","What is the effect of carbon pricing on inflation? This paper shows empirically that the consequences of the European Union’s Emission Trading System (ETS) and national carbon taxation on inflation have been limited in the euro area, so far. This result is supported by analysis based on a panel local projections approach, as well as event studies based on individual countries. Our estimates suggest that carbon taxes raised the price of energy but had limited effects on overall consumer prices. Since future climate policy will need to be much more ambitious compared to what has been observed so far, including the need for larger increases in carbon prices, possible non-linearities might make extrapolating from historical results difficult. We thus also use input-output tables to simulate the mechanical effect of a carbon tax consistent with the EU’s ‘Fit-for-55’ commitments on inflation. The required increase of effective carbon prices from around 40 Euro per ton of CO2 in 2021 to around 150 Euro by 2030 could raise annual euro area inflation by between 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points. It is worth noting that the energy price increases caused by the rise in the effective carbon price to 150 Euro is substantially smaller than the energy price spike seen in 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/09/Carbon-Prices-and-Inflation-in-the-Euro-Area-544465,WPIEA2024031,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/17/2024
Constraints on Trade in the LAC Region,"Rina Bhattacharya, Samuel Pienknagura","This paper studies Latin America and the Caribbean’s (LAC) trade performance in recent years and estimates the salience of key country-specific factors in explaining underperformance in some sub-regions within LAC. First, the paper documents that, while the average country in the region displays aggregate trade values that are consistent with a standard gravity model, there is substantial heterogeneity across sub-regions and product-types. The paper then estimates an augmented gravity specification that includes proxies for the quality of infrastructure, the availability and quality of factors of production, and governance. Results point to infrastructure and customs regulation as key factors explaining undertrading in manufacturing in most sub-regions. Factors of production partly explain South America’s underpeformance in manufacturing while governance explains undertrading across most product groups, but neither set of factors play a significant role in other sub-regions.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/16/Constraints-on-Trade-in-the-LAC-Region-544936,WPIEA2024032,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/17/2024
Political Fragility: Coups d’État and Their Drivers,"Aliona Cebotari, Enrique Chueca-Montuenga, Yoro Diallo, Yunsheng Ma, Rima A Turk, Weining Xin, Harold Zavarce","The paper explores the drivers of political fragility by focusing on coups d’état as symptomatic of such fragility. It uses event studies to identify factors that exhibit significantly different dynamics in the runup to coups, and machine learning to identify these stressors and more structural determinants of fragility—as well as their nonlinear interactions—that create an environment propitious to coups. The paper finds that the destabilization of a country’s economic, political or security environment—such as low growth, high inflation, weak external positions, political instability and conflict—set the stage for a higher likelihood of coups, with overlapping stressors amplifying each other. These stressors are more likely to lead to breakdowns in political systems when demographic pressures and underlying structural weaknesses (especially poverty, exclusion, and weak governance) are present or when policies are weaker, through complex interactions. Conversely, strengthened fundamentals and macropolicies have higher returns in structurally fragile environments in terms of staving off political breakdowns, suggesting that continued engagement by multilateral institutions and donors in fragile situations is likely to yield particularly high dividends. The model performs well in predicting coups out of sample, having predicted a high probability of most 2020-23 coups, including in the Sahel region.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/16/Political-Fragility-Coups-dtat-and-Their-Drivers-544943,WPIEA2024034,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/17/2024
Sectoral Debt and Global Dollar Cycles in Developing Economies,"Bada Han, Rashad Ahmed, Joshua Aizenman, Yothin Jinjarak","We explore the role of sectoral debt dynamics in shaping business cycles in a sample of 52 Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) and Frontier Market Economies (FMEs) from 2005 to 2021. Higher household debt levels and growth are associated with significantly slower GDP growth in more developed EMEs but not in less developed EMEs and FMEs. We also examine the relationship between US dollar cycles, sectoral debt levels and growth, and economic activity. Among developed EMEs, higher expected household debt growth magnifies the impact of US dollar fluctuations on economic activity, with significant but less persistent effects on consumption and more persistent effects on investment.

Small Firm Growth and the VAT Threshold Evidence for the UK,"Li Liu, Ben Lockwood, Eddy H.F. Tam","This paper studies the effect of the VAT threshold on firm growth in the UK, using exogenous variation over time in the threshold, combined with turnover bin fixed effects, for identification. We find robust evidence that annual growth in turnover slows by about 1 percentage point when firm turnover gets close to the threshold, with no evidence of higher growth when the threshold is passed. Growth in firm costs shows a similar pattern, indicating that the response to the threshold is likely to be a real response rather than an evasion response. Firms that habitually register even when their turnover is below the VAT threshold (voluntary registered firms) have growth that is unaffected by the threshold, whereas firms that select into the Flat-Rate Scheme have a less pronounced slowdown response than other firms. Similar patterns of turnover and cost growth around the threshold are also observed for non-incorporated businesses. Finally, simulation results clarify the relative contribution of ``crossers"" (firms who eventually register for VAT) and ``non-crossers"" (those who permanently stay below the threshold) in explaining our empirical findings.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/16/Small-Firm-Growth-and-the-VAT-Threshold-Evidence-for-the-UK-544462,WPIEA2024033,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/17/2024
The Arity of Disparity: Updating Disparate Impact  for Modern Fair Lending,"Spencer Caro, Scott Nelson","Plaintiffs often cannot prevail under a disparate impact (“DI”) claim of discrimination unless they show the defendant failed to implement a less discriminatory alternative (“LDA”) to a practice that yields a disparate output across protected classes. Traditional LDA analysis focuses on a singular notion of fairness: parity, or the equality of screening decisions across protected groups. However, recent scholarship highlights that parity is only one of numerous competing notions of fairness that may seem just as compelling as, but be mutually exclusive with, parity. The arity of disparity is larger than DI has acknowledged. We propose formalizing LDA analysis as an explicit constraint on choices over screening models and data inputs. The constraint restricts model-induced disparities in both parity and a competing notion of fairness—accuracy—relative to a “budget” that depends straightforwardly on overall model performance. We also show how this trade-off leads to balancing other notions of fairness, as weighted combinations of parity and accuracy span many other fairness notions in a helpful way. For concreteness, our legal argument and our applied examples focus on DI under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”). We address tension between DI’s traditional focus on parity and ECOA’s statutory emphasis on “credit-worthy” consumers and discuss implications for new frontiers in credit underwriting, including the use of machine learning and alternative data sources.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/the-arity-of-disparity-updating-disparate-impact-for-modern-fair-lending/,2024-18,15-Feb-24,BFI,2/18/2024
How Managers Can Use Purchaser Performance Information to Improve Procurement Efficiency,"Pablo A. Celhay, Paul Gertler, Marcelo Olivares, Raimundo Undurraga","We examine the effect of performance monitoring in public procurement through the lens of organizational culture in a principal-agent model where the manager (principal) and buyers (agents) may have different beliefs about how much the government values efficiency. We show that the effect of performance information not only increases efficiency but is greater when the buyer’s belief is stronger than the manager’s belief. We leverage a new e-procurement system in Chile to test these ideas by randomizing monthly reports on the purchasing performance of buyers and further whether the individual performance reports were disclosed to managers. We find that the reports generated sizable reductions in overspending — with savings reaching a 15% reduction or 0.1% of GDP — but only when individual performance was observable to managers. This is consistent with extrinsic motivation rather than intrinsic motivation driving buyer behavior. Consistent with the theoretical model, we also find that the gain in efficiency is concentrated in procurement units where buyer belief that the government cares about efficiency is stronger than manager belief. Our results highlight the key role played by organizational culture in mediating the impact of purchasing performance information on preventing the misuse of public resources.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32141,32141,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
Invoice Currency Choice in Intra-Firm Trade: A Transaction-Level Analysis of Japanese Automobile Exports,"Taiyo Yoshimi, Uraku Yoshimoto, Kiyotaka Sato, Takatoshi Ito, Junko Shimizu, Yushi Yoshida","This study empirically investigates how the invoice currency choice differs between intra-firm and arm’s-length exports. We also examine whether other firm- and product-level characteristics affect the choice of invoice currency. This study is the first to be granted access to highly disaggregated transaction-level trade data for Japan. Focusing on Japanese automobile exports to France, we demonstrate that the importer’s currency tends to be chosen in intra-firm export invoicing based on a panel logit estimation. Our empirical findings remain robust when different types of intra-firm export variables and other conventional explanatory variables are introduced, such as firm and product market share, exchange rate volatility, euro-invoiced imports, labor productivity, and research and development intensity. Given growing intra-firm trade and expanding global value chains, Japanese parent firms tend to invoice in the importers’ currency, assuming the foreign exchange risk that arises from intra-firm trade. Thus, exchange rate risk management is a significant consideration for Japanese parent firms.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32142,32142,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
Technology Regulation Reconsidered: The Effects of Certificate of Need Policies on the Quantity and Quality of Diagnostic Imaging,"Jill Horwitz, Austin Nichols, Carrie H. Colla, David M.

Using an original dataset identifying imaging-related CON laws, we estimate the effects of CON on CT and MRI, using regression discontinuities at state borders. Medicare beneficiaries in regulated states are slightly less likely to receive any image and considerably less likely to receive low-value imaging than beneficiaries in non-regulated states. High-value imaging is either unaffected or declines much less.

"Labor Migration, Capital Accumulation, and the Structure of Rural Labor Markets","Taryn Dinkelman, Grace Kumchulesi, Martine Mariotti","Between 1967 and 1974, a bilateral treaty increased circular labor migration from Malawi to South Africa by 200%, bringing over 53 million USD in earnings into origin communities. A deadly migrant worker plane crash in 1974 ended these flows and led to migrant repatriation. We study how this shock affected local labor markets. In regions receiving more migrant capital after the crash, workers, particularly women, shifted from farming into non-farm work over thirty years. Investments in non-farm physical and human capital contribute to these sectoral changes. This natural experiment shows that temporary capital inflows can permanently reshape rural labor markets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32144,32144,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
"Climate Change, Population Growth, and Population Pressure","J. Vernon Henderson, Bo Yeon Jang, Adam Storeygard, David N.

We apply it to estimate and compare the projected effects of climate change and population growth over the course of the 21st century, by country and globally. We find that standard population growth projections imply larger reductions in income than even the most extreme widely-adopted climate change scenario (RCP8.5). Climate and population impacts are correlated across countries: climate change and population growth will have their most damaging effects in similar places. Relative to previous work on macro climate impacts, our approach has the advantages of being disciplined by a simple macro growth model that allows for adaptation and of assessing impacts via a large set of climate moments, not just annual average temperature and precipitation.  Further, our estimated effects of climate are by construction independent of country-level factors such as institutions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32145,32145,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
"Data, Privacy Laws and Firm Production: Evidence from the GDPR","Mert Demirer, Diego J. Jiménez Hernández, Dean Li, Sida Peng","By regulating how firms collect, store, and use data, privacy laws may change the role of data in production and alter firm demand for information technology inputs. We study how firms respond to privacy laws in the context of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by using seven years of data from a large global cloud-computing provider. Our difference-in-difference estimates indicate that, in response to the GDPR, EU firms decreased data storage by 26% and data processing by 15% relative to comparable US firms, becoming less “data-intensive.” To estimate the costs of the GDPR for firms, we propose and estimate a production function where data and computation serve as inputs to the production of “information."" We find that data and computation are strong complements in production and that firm responses are consistent with the GDPR, representing a 20% increase in the cost of data on average. Variation in the firm-level effects of the GDPR and industry-level exposure to data, however, drives significant heterogeneity in our estimates of the impact of the GDPR on production costs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32146,32146,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
Misallocation and Asset Prices,"Winston Wei Dou, Yan Ji, Di Tian, Pengfei Wang","We develop an endogenous growth model with heterogeneous firms facing financial frictions, where misallocation emerges explicitly as a crucial endogenous state variable and plays a significant role in driving economic growth through the valuation channel. The model illustrates that transient macroeconomic shocks affecting misallocation can yield persistent effects on aggregate growth. In equilibrium, slow-moving misallocation endogenously generates long-run uncertainty about economic growth by distorting innovation decisions. When agents hold recursive preferences, misallocation-driven low-frequency growth fluctuations result in substantial risk premia in capital markets and large losses in consumer welfare. Employing a misallocation measure motivated by the model, we substantiate our findings with empirical evidence showing that misallocation effectively captures low-frequency fluctuations in both aggregate growth and asset returns.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32147,32147,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
Understanding the Demand-Side of an Illegal Market: Prohibition of Menthol Cigarettes,"Donald S. Kenkel, Alan D. Mathios, Grace N. Phillips, Revathy Suryanarayana, Hua Wang, Sen Zeng","The Food and Drug Administration has proposed to prohibit menthol cigarettes, which are smoked by almost 19 million people in the U.S.  Illegal markets for menthol cigarettes could not only blunt the prohibition’s intended consequence to reduce smoking but could also lead to unintended consequences. We use data from a discrete choice experiment to estimate a mixed logit model which predicts that the prohibition of menthol cigarettes would substantially increase the fraction of menthol smokers who attempt to quit. However, our model also predicts a substantial potential consumer demand for illegal menthol cigarettes. Depending on the impact of illegality on product prices, our model predicts the potential demand-side of an illegal market for menthol cigarettes could be 59-92 percent the size of the status quo market if menthol e-cigarettes are legal, and 69-100 percent the size of the status quo market if menthol e-cigarettes are also illegal. Our mixed logit model estimated in willingness to pay space implies that the mean WTP to avoid an illegal retail market is equivalent to a tax of $8.44 per pack. In our partial cost-benefit analysis, the opportunity costs of prohibition exceed the value of the reduction in mortality risks from secondhand smoke by $15.4 billion annually.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32148,32148,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
A Cognitive Foundation for Perceiving Uncertainty,"J. Aislinn Bohren, Josh Hascher, Alex Imas, Michael Ungeheuer, Martin Weber","We propose a framework where perceptions of uncertainty are driven by the interaction between cognitive constraints and the way that people learn about it—whether information is presented sequentially or simultaneously. People can learn about uncertainty by observing the distribution of outcomes all at once (e.g., seeing a stock return distribution) or sampling outcomes from the relevant distribution sequentially (e.g., experiencing a series of stock returns). Limited attention leads to the overweighting of unlikely but salient events—the dominant force when learning from simultaneous information—whereas imperfect recall leads to the underweighting of such events—the dominant force when learning sequentially. A series of studies show that, when learning from simultaneous information, people are overoptimistic about and are attracted to assets that mostly underperform, but sporadically exhibit large outperformance. However, they overwhelmingly select more consistently outperforming assets when learning the same information sequentially, and this is reflected in beliefs. The entire 40-percentage point preference reversal appears to be driven by limited attention and memory; manipulating these factors completely eliminates the effect of the learning environment on choices and beliefs, and can even reverse it.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32149,32149,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
Trade War and Peace: U.S.-China Trade and Tariff Risk from 2015–2050,"George A. Alessandria, Shafaat Y. Khan, Armen Khederlarian, Kim J. Ruhl, Joseph B.

We find (i) there was no increase in the likelihood of a trade war before 2018; (ii) the trade war was initially expected to end quickly, but its expected duration grew substantially after 2020; and (iii) the trade war reduced the likelihood that China would face Non-Normal Trade Relations tariffs in the future. Our findings imply that the expected mean future U.S. tariff on China rose more under President Biden than under President Trump. We also show that the trade response to the trade war is similar to the response to the 1980 liberalization that initially granted China access to U.S. markets at NTR terms and was expected to be quickly reversed.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32150,32150,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
The Essential Role of Altruism in Medical Decision Making,"Paul Gertler, Ada Kwan","Patients rely on medical care providers to act in their best interests because providers understand disease pathology and appropriate treatment much better than patients. Providers, however, not only give advice (diagnose) but also deliver (sell) treatments based on that advice. This creates a moral hazard dilemma where provider financial interests can diverge from patient interests, especially when providers are motivated more by profits than by altruism. We investigate how profit motivated versus altruistic preferences influence medical care decision making in the context of malaria in Kenya. We measured the appropriateness of care using data from an audit study that employed standardized patients (SP) who were trained to present as real patients the identical clinical case scenario to providers. The SPs were confirmed to be malaria negative before and after field work with a very reliable and sensitive blood test at a high-quality laboratory. We measured provider preferences using a lab in the field, real stakes, modified version of the dictator game. We find that more profit-motivated providers report higher rates of false-positive malaria test results than do more altruistic providers. Specifically, purely profit motivated providers report 30 percentage points more positives than providers who are altruistically motivated, and providers likely knew that the positive results that they reported to their patients were false. We also find that more profit motivated providers sold more unnecessary antimalarial drugs than did more altruistic providers. Based on mediation analysis, more profit-oriented providers sold more drugs not only because they knowingly reported more false positives, but also because they promoted drugs sales more conditional on a positive test result. Thus, profit motivated providers seem to have misrepresented test results to sell more unnecessary malaria-related drugs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32151,32151,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
Smooth Diagnostic Expectations,"Francesco Bianchi, Cosmin L. Ilut, Hikaru Saijo","We introduce “smooth diagnosticity.” Under smooth diagnosticity, agents over-react to new information defined as the difference between the current information set and a previous information set. Since new information typically changes not just the conditional mean, but also the conditional uncertainty, changes in uncertainty surrounding current and past beliefs affect the severity of the Diagnostic Expectations (DE) distortion. Smooth DE nests the baseline DE of Bordalo et al. (2018) and implies a joint and parsimonious micro-foundation for various properties of survey data: (1) over-reaction of conditional mean to news, (2) stronger over-reaction for weaker signals and longer forecast horizons, and (3) over-confidence in subjective uncertainty. We embed Smooth DE in an analytical RBC model. The model accounts for over-reaction and over-confidence in surveys, as well as three salient properties of the business cycle: (1) asymmetry, (2) countercyclical micro volatility, and (3) countercyclical macro volatility.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32152,32152,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
Taxing Top Wealth: Migration Responses and their Aggregate Economic Implications,"Katrine Jakobsen, Henrik Kleven, Jonas Kolsrud, Camille Landais, Mathilde Muñoz","Using administrative data on wealth, firm ownership structure, and migration in Sweden and Denmark, we document international migration patterns among the very wealthy, their impact on the economy, and how they respond to wealth taxation. We show that more than 20% of taxpayers liable to pay wealth tax are business-owners, and that the employment, investments, and value-added of these businesses are negatively affected when their owner migrates out of the country. Exploiting three large reforms, we then isolate the causal effect of wealth taxation on the international location choices of the wealthy. We find significant effects on out-migration flows from increases in the effective wealth tax. But, we also document that the overall level of these migration flows is remarkably small, with annual net-migration rates below .01%. As a result, we find that the aggregate economic effects of tax-induced migration are modest in Scandinavia: a one percentage point increase in the average wealth tax rate on the top 2% decreases the stock of wealthy taxpayers by at most 2% in the long run, and lead to a reduction of at most .03% in aggregate employment and at most .1% in aggregate value- added. Hence, our results suggest that trickle-down effects of tax-induced migration by the wealthy do exist, but that they are quantitatively small.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32153,32153,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
Gender Differences in Negotiations and Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from an Information Intervention with College Students,"Patricia Cortés, Jacob French, Jessica Pan, Basit Zafar","We assess the role of information gaps in understanding gender differences in negotiation behavior by conducting a randomized information experiment on the 2018 to 2020 graduating cohorts of undergraduate business majors from Boston University. Prior to starting their job search, treated students were provided with objective information about the gender gap in negotiation among their peers along with the earnings changes conditional on negotiating. We find sizable immediate effects on negotiation intentions that persist to actual negotiation behavior, particularly for men. While the treatment affects women's negotiation behavior through belief-updating, the effects on men's behavior are primarily through increased salience of the information. Further, we find some evidence that gender-specific treatment spillovers likely contribute to the smaller average treatment effects on behavior for women. Overall, our findings suggest that such information interventions can help to nudge women who have potentially large financial returns to negotiation to realize these gains.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32154,32154,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024
Information-Based Pricing in Specialized Lending,"Kristian Blickle, Zhiguo He, Jing Huang, Cecilia Parlatore","We study specialized lending in a credit market competition model with private information. Two banks, equipped with similar data processing systems, possess “general” signals regarding the borrower's quality. However, the specialized bank gains an additional advantage through further interactions with the borrower, allowing it to access “specialized” signals. In equilibrium, both lenders use general signals to screen loan applications, and the specialized lender prices the loan based on its specialized signal conditional on making a loan. This private-information-based pricing helps deliver the empirical regularity that loans made by specialized lenders have lower rates (i.e., lower winning bids) and better ex-post performance (i.e., lower non-performing loans). We show the robustness of our equilibrium characterization under a generalized information structure, endogenize the specialized lending through information acquisition, and discuss its various economic implications.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32155,32155,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024

Declining Clientelism of Welfare Benefits? Targeting and Political Competition based Evidence from an Indian state,"Pushkar Maitra, Sandip Mitra, Dilip Mookherjee, Sujata Visaria","It has been argued that since 2014, under the BJP-led central government, welfare benefits in India have become better targeted and less prone to clientelistic control by state and local governments. Arguably this has helped to increase the vote share of the BJP vis-a-vis regional parties. We test these hypotheses using longitudinal data from 3500 rural households in the state of West Bengal. We fail to find evidence that the new “central” programs introduced after 2014 were better targeted than traditional “state” programs, or that the targeting of state programs improved after 2014. Households receiving the new “central” benefits introduced since 2014 were more likely to switch their political support to the BJP. However, changes in the scale, composition or targeting of these programs, in clientelistic effectiveness of traditional state programs or in household incomes, fail to account for the large observed increase in the voters' support for the BJP. Non-Hindus, especially recent immigrant non-Hindus, were much less likely to switch support to the BJP, even after controlling for benefits received and changes in household incomes. Our results suggest that ideology and identity politics were more important factors explaining the rising popularity of the BJP.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32157,32157,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024

German households living in areas with higher local inflation during the hyperinflation of the 1920s expect higher inflation today, after partialling out determinants of historical inflation and current inflation expectations . Our evidence points towards transmission of inflation experiences from parents to children and through collective memory.

English Language Requirement and Educational Inequality: Evidence from 16 Million College Applicants in China,"Hongbin Li, Lingsheng Meng, Kai Mu, Shaoda Wang","This paper studies the unintended effect of English language requirement on educational inequality by investigating how the staggered rollout of English listening tests in China’s high-stakes National College Entrance Exam (NCEE) affected the rural-urban gap in college access. Leveraging administrative data covering the universe of NCEE participants between 1999 and 2003, we find that the introduction of English listening tests significantly lowered rural students’ exam score percentile ranks relative to their urban counterparts, resulting in a 30% increase in the rural-urban gap in college access. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, as a result of this policy change, more than 54,000 rural students lost college seats to their urban peers between 1999 and 2003, and another 11,000 rural students who elite colleges could have admitted ended up in non-elite colleges, causing them significant future income losses.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32162,32162,24-Feb,NBER,2/19/2024

The entire 40-percentage point preference reversal appears to be driven by limited attention and memory; manipulating these factors completely eliminates the effect of the learning environment on choices and beliefs, and can even reverse it.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/a-cognitive-foundation-for-perceiving-uncertainty/,2024-19,19-Feb-24,BFI,2/20/2024
English Language Requirement and Educational Inequality: Evidence from 16 Million College Applicants in China,"Hongbin Li, Lingsheng Meng, Kai Mu, Shaoda Wang","This paper studies the unintended effect of English language requirement on educational inequality by investigating how the staggered rollout of English listening tests in China’s high-stakes National College Entrance Exam (NCEE) affected the rural-urban gap in college access. Leveraging administrative data covering the universe of NCEE participants between 1999 and 2003, we find that the introduction of English listening tests significantly lowered rural students’ exam score percentile ranks relative to their urban counterparts, resulting in a 30% increase in the rural-urban gap in college access. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, as a result of this policy change, more than 54,000 rural students lost college seats to their urban peers between 1999 and 2003, and another 11,000 rural students who elite colleges could have admitted ended up in non-elite colleges, causing them significant future income losses.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/english-language-requirement-and-educational-inequality-evidence-from-16-million-college-applicants-in-china/,2024-20,19-Feb-24,BFI,2/20/2024

The nonlinear effects of banks’ vulnerability to capital depletion in euro area countries,"Sharada Nia Davidson, Diego Nicolas Moccero","When capital in the banking system becomes depleted, the degree to which financial intermediation and the macroeconomy are adversely affected is likely to depend on the financial and macroeconomic environment. However, existing studies either assume that the effects of bank capital shocks are linear or ignore feedback effects and the impact on the macroeconomy. Using data on the largest euro area countries and Bayesian Panel Threshold VARs, we investigate the importance of different factors in amplifying shocks in banks’ vulnerability to capital depletion. Our results demonstrate that nonlinearities matter. When the banking sector is already vulnerable to large capital losses, it is more difficult for banks to accommodate a depletion in capital and lending and economic activity contract more severely. Similarly, low interest rates, which are typically associated with low bank margins and profitability, also lead to a larger decline in lending. De-risking is also more pronounced in these cases.

A Post-Pandemic New Normal for Interest Rates in Emerging Bond Markets? Evidence from Chile,"Luis Ceballos, Jens H. E. Christensen, Damian Romero","Before the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers intensely debated the extent of the decline in the steady-state short-term real interest rate—the so-called equilibrium or natural rate of interest. Given the recent sharp increase in interest rates, we revisit this question in an emerging bond market context and offer a Chilean perspective using a dynamic term structure finance model estimated directly on the prices of individual Chilean inflation indexed bonds with adjustments for bond-specific liquidity risk and real term premia.

Optimal Urban Transportation Policy: Evidence from Chicago,"Milena Almagro, Felipe Barbieri, Juan Camilo Castillo, Nathaniel Hickok, Tobias Salz","We characterize optimal urban transportation policies in the presence of congestion and environmental externalities and evaluate their welfare and distributional effects. We present a framework of a municipal government that implements different transportation equilibria through its choice of public transit policies, prices and frequencies, as well as road pricing. The government faces a budget constraint that introduces monopoly-like distortions. We apply this framework to Chicago, for which we construct a new dataset that comprehensively captures transportation choices. We ﬁnd that road pricing alone leads to large welfare gains by reducing externalities, but at the expense of consumers (travelers), whose surplus falls even if road pricing revenues are fully rebated. The largest losses are borne by middle income consumers, who are most reliant on cars. We ﬁnd that the optimal price of public transit is close to zero and goes along with a reduction in the frequency of buses and an increase in the frequency of trains. Combining these transit policies with road pricing eliminates budget constraints. This allows the government to implement higher transit frequencies and even lower prices, in which case consumer surplus increases after rebates.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/optimal-urban-transportation-policy-evidence-from-chicago/,2024-22,22-Feb-24,BFI,2/23/2024

A New Measure of Central Bank Independence,"Tobias Adrian, Ashraf Khan, Lev Menand","This paper constructs a new index for measuring de jure central bank independence, the first entirely new index in three decades. The index draws on a comprehensive dataset from the IMF’s Central Bank Legislation Database (CBLD) and Monetary Operations and Instruments Database (MOID) and weightings derived from a survey of 87 respondents, mostly consisting of central bank governors and general counsels. It improves upon existing indices including the Cukierman, Webb, and Neyapti (CWN) index, which has been the de facto standard for measuring central bank independence since 1992, as well as recent extensions by Garriga (2016) and Romelli (2022). For example, it includes areas absent from the CWN index, such as board composition, financial independence, and budgetary independence. It treats dimensions such as the status of the chief executive as composite metrics to prevent overstating the independence of statutory schemes. It distills ten key metrics, simplifying current frameworks that now include upwards of forty distinct variables. And it replaces the subjective weighting systems relied on in the existing literature with an empirically grounded alternative. This paper presents the key features of the new index; a companion, forthcoming paper will provide detailed findings by country/region, income level, and exchange rate regime.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/23/A-New-Measure-of-Central-Bank-Independence-545270,WPIEA2024035,"Fri, 23 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/24/2024

Determinants of Zombie Banks in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies,"Torsten Wezel, Hannah Sheldon, Zhengwei Fu","While deeply undercapitalized banks have been shown to misallocate credit to weak firms, the drivers of such zombie banks are less researched, particularly across countries. To furnish empirical evidence, we compile a dataset of undercapitalized banks from emerging markets and developing economies. We classify zombie banks as those not receiving remedial treatment by owners or regulators or, alternatively, remaining chronically undercapitalized. Using logit regressions, we find that country-specific factors are more influential for zombie status than bank characteristics, alhough some become significant when disaggreating by region.

Accurate, long-range forecasts enable farmers to optimize for the season ahead. We experimentally evaluate monsoon onset forecasts in India, randomizing 250 villages into control; a forecast group receiving information well in advance of onset; and a benchmark index insurance group. Forecast farmers update their beliefs and their behavior: farmers who receive \bad news” relative to their priors substantially reduce land under cultivation and certain input expenditures, while those receiving \good news” signi cantly increase input expenditures.

The Role of Friends in the Opioid Epidemic,"Effrosyni Adamopoulou, Jeremy Greenwood, Nezih Guner, Karen Kopecky","The role of friends in the US opioid epidemic is examined. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health), adults aged 25-34 and their high school best friends are focused on. An instrumental variable technique is employed to estimate peer effects in opioid misuse. Severe injuries in the previous year are used as an instrument for opioid misuse in order to estimate the causal impact of someone misusing opioids on the probability that their best friends also misuse. The estimated peer effects are significant: Having a best friend with a reported serious injury in the previous year increases the probability of own opioid misuse by around 7 percentage points in a population where 17 percent ever misuses opioids. The effect is driven by individuals without a college degree and those who live in the same county as their best friends.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2404-role-of-friends-in-opioid-epidemic,24-04,02.20.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,2/26/2024
The Cost of Money is Part of the Cost of Living: New Evidence on the Consumer Sentiment Anomaly,"Marijn A. Bolhuis, Judd N. L. Cramer, Karl Oskar Schulz, Lawrence H. Summers","Unemployment is low and inflation is falling, but consumer sentiment remains depressed. This has confounded economists, who historically rely on these two variables to gauge how consumers feel about the economy. We propose that borrowing costs, which have grown at rates they had not reached in decades, do much to explain this gap. The cost of money is not currently included in traditional price indexes, indicating a disconnect between the measures favored by economists and the effective costs borne by consumers. We show that the lows in US consumer sentiment that cannot be explained by unemployment and official inflation are strongly correlated with borrowing costs and consumer credit supply. Concerns over borrowing costs, which have historically tracked the cost of money, are at their highest levels since the Volcker-era. We then develop alternative measures of inflation that include borrowing costs and can account for almost three quarters of the gap in US consumer sentiment in 2023. Global evidence shows that consumer sentiment gaps across countries are also strongly correlated with changes in interest rates.

We consider a common environment where the researcher only has access to a short panel on choices and realized outcomes. We establish identification of the outcome equation parameters and the distribution of the three types of unobservables, under the standard assumption that unknown heterogeneity and uncertainty are normally distributed. We also show that, absent known heterogeneity, the model is identified without making any distributional assumption. We then derive the asymptotic properties of a sieve MLE estimator for the model parameters, and devise a tractable profile likelihood based estimation procedure.

Climate Policy Reform Options in 2025,"John Bistline, Kimberly A. Clausing, Neil Mehrotra, James H. Stock, Catherine Wolfram","With the expiration of many tax cuts and unmet climate targets, 2025 could be a crucial year for climate policy in the United States. Using an integrated model of energy supply and demand, this paper aims to assess climate policies that the U.S. federal government may consider in 2025 and to evaluate emissions reductions, fiscal costs and revenues, and household energy expenditures across a range of policy scenarios. Model results suggest that the emissions reductions of the Inflation Reduction Act are significantly augmented under scenarios that add a modest carbon fee or, to a lesser extent, that implement a clean electricity standard in the power sector. Second, net fiscal costs can be substantially reduced in scenarios that include a carbon fee, especially if fossil fuel exports are taxed. Third, expanding the IRA tax credits yields modest additional emissions reductions with higher fiscal costs. Finally, although none of the policy combinations across these scenarios achieve the U.S. target of a 50-52% economy-wide emissions reduction by 2030 from 2005 levels, the carbon fee and clean electricity standard scenarios achieve these levels between 2030 and 2035.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32168,32168,24-Feb,NBER,2/26/2024
Demand Shocks as Technology Shocks,"Yan Bai, José-Víctor Ríos-Rull, Kjetil Storesletten","We provide a macroeconomic theory where demand for goods has a productive role. A search friction prevents perfect matching between producers and potential customers. Larger demand induces more search, which in turn increases GDP and measured TFP. We embed the product-market friction in a standard neoclassical model and estimate it using Bayesian techniques. Business cycles are driven by preference shocks, true technology shocks, and investment-specific shocks. Preference shocks have qualitatively similar effects as true productivity shocks. These shocks account for a large share of the fluctuations in consumption, GDP, and measured TFP and can be identified using shopping time data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32169,32169,24-Feb,NBER,2/26/2024
Do Information Frictions and Corruption Perceptions Kill Competition? A Field Experiment On Public Procurement in Uganda,"Emanuele Colonnelli, Francesco Loiacono, Edwin Muhumuza, Edoardo Teso","We study whether information frictions and corruption perceptions deter firms from doing business with the government. We conduct two nationwide randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in collaboration with the national public procurement supervisory and anti-corruption agency in Uganda. The first RCT aims to increase firms’ information on available procurement opportunities, which is limited due to the lack of a centralized e- procurement system. We provide firms with direct and timely access to information about government tenders over a two-year period. The second RCT focuses on firms’ perceptions about the integrity of public entities, which we experimentally show are key drivers of firms’ participation in procurement. We provide firms with access to structured information on other firms’ perceptions and on anti-corruption audits. We find that increasing information on available procurement opportunities alone does not increase firm participation in public procurement. However, changing firms’ perceptions about the integrity of public entities increases firms’ total number of bids and total government contracts won. Based on our findings, our partner agency implemented several measures to further restore firms’ trust in public entities. Overall, our findings point to the limits of transparency reforms that aim to increase competition in public procurement without accounting for firms’ perceptions about government corruption and inefficiency.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32170,32170,24-Feb,NBER,2/26/2024
Competitive Job Seekers: When Sharing Less Leaves Firms at a Loss,"Gaurav Chiplunkar, Erin M. Kelley, Gregory V. Lane","We study how job-seekers share information about jobs within their social network, and its implications for firms. We randomly increase the amount of competition for a job and find that job-seekers are: (i) less likely to share information about the job with their peers; and (ii) choose to selectively share it with fewer higher ability peers. This lowers the quality of applicants received by firms, subsequent hires made, and performance on the job — suggesting that firms who rely on social networks to disseminate job information may see lower quality applicants than expected for their most competitive positions. While randomly offering higher wages attracts better talent, it is not able to fully overcome these strategic disincentives in information sharing",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32171,32171,24-Feb,NBER,2/26/2024

At high unemployment rates, an increase in demand reduces unemployment without creating strong inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, supply shocks have a muted effect. At sufficiently low unemployment, there is a labor shortage, so that the economy is at full capacity. Then, higher demand is inflationary, and supply shocks are amplified.

From Dominant to Producer Currency Pricing: Dynamics of Chilean Exports,"José De Gregorio, Pablo García, Emiliano E. Luttini, Marco Rojas","We revisit a central question for international macroeconomics: the response of export prices and quantities to movements in the exchange rate (ER). We use granular export data for Chile and study how the effects of ER movements vary over time with the currency of invoicing and the destination of exports. For prices, we find that the short-run effects of bilateral ER movements vanish when controlling for U.S. dollar ER, which supports dominant currency pricing. However, over longer horizons a more significant role is played by bilateral ER movements, in line with the predictions of producer currency pricing. These dynamics do not depend on the invoicing currency. The results we find for quantities support the view that bilateral exchange rate movements contribute to macroeconomic adjustment through export volumes over the medium term.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32175,32175,24-Feb,NBER,2/26/2024
The Secular Decline of Bank Balance Sheet Lending,"Greg Buchak, Gregor Matvos, Tomasz Piskorski, Amit Seru","The traditional model of bank-led financial intermediation, where banks issue demandable deposits to savers and make informationally sensitive loans to borrowers, has seen a dramatic decline since 1970s. Instead, private credit is increasingly intermediated through arms-length transactions, such as securitization. This paper documents these trends, explores their causes, and discusses their implications for the financial system and regulation. We document that the balance sheet share of overall private lending has declined from 60% in 1970 to 35% in 2023, while the deposit share of savings has declined from 22% to 13%. Additionally, the share of loans as a percentage of bank assets has fallen from 70% to 55%. We develop a structural model to explore whether technological improvements in securitization, shifts in saver preferences away from deposits, and changes in implicit subsidies and costs of bank activities can explain these shifts. Declines in securitization cost account for changes in aggregate lending quantities. Savers, rather than borrowers, are the main drivers of bank balance sheet size, Implicit banks’ costs and subsidies explain shifting bank balance sheet composition. Together, these forces explain the fall in the overall share of informationally sensitive bank lending in credit intermediation. We conclude by examining how these shifts impact the financial sector’s sensitivity to macroprudential regulation. While raising capital requirements or liquidity requirements decreases lending in both early (1960s) and recent (2020’s) scenarios, the effect is less pronounced in the later period due to the reduced role of bank balance sheets in credit intermediation. The substitution of bank balance sheet loans with debt securities in response to these policies explains why we observe only a fairly modest decline in aggregate lending despite a large contraction of bank balance sheet lending. Overall, we find that the intermediation sector has undergone significant transformation, with implications for macroprudential policy and financial regulation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32176,32176,24-Feb,NBER,2/26/2024
Diversity and Discrimination in the Classroom,"Dan Anderberg, Gordon B. Dahl, Cristina Felfe, Helmut Rainer, Thomas Siedler","What makes diversity unifying in some settings but divisive in others?  We examine how the mixing of ethnic groups in German schools affects intergroup cooperation and trust. We leverage the quasi-random assignment of students to classrooms within schools to obtain variation in the type of diversity that prevails in a peer group. We combine this with a large-scale, incentivized lab-in-field-experiment based on the investment game, allowing us to assess the in-group bias of native German students in their interactions with fellow natives (in-group) versus immigrants (out-group). We find in-group bias peaks in culturally polarized classrooms, where the native and immigrant groups are both large, but have different religious or language backgrounds.  In contrast, in classrooms characterized by non-cultural polarization, fractionalization, or a native supermajority, there are significantly lower levels of own-group favoritism. In terms of mechanisms, we find empirical evidence that culturally polarized classrooms foster negative stereotypes about immigrants' trustworthiness and amplify taste-based discrimination, both of which are costly and lead to lower payouts. In contrast, accurate statistical discrimination is ruled out by design in our experiment. These findings suggest that extra efforts are needed to counteract low levels of inclusivity and trust in culturally polarized environments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32177,32177,24-Feb,NBER,2/26/2024
Regional Dissent: Do Local Economic Conditions Influence FOMC Votes?,"Anton Bobrov, Rupal Kamdar, Mauricio Ulate","U.S. monetary-policy decisions are made by the 12 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven of these members, coming from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, inherently represent national-level interests. The remaining five members, a rotating group of presidents from the 12 Federal Reserve districts, come instead from sub-national jurisdictions. Does this structure have relevant implications for the monetary policy-making process? In this paper, we first build a panel dataset on economic activity across Fed districts. We then provide evidence that regional economic conditions influence the voting behavior of district presidents. Specifically, a regional unemployment rate that is one percentage point higher than the U.S. level is associated with an approximately nine percentage points higher probability of dissenting in favor of looser policy at the FOMC. This result is statistically significant, robust to different specifications, and indicates that the regional component in the structure of the FOMC could matter for monetary policy.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/02/regional-dissent-do-local-economic-conditions-influence-fomc-votes,2024-05,2/26/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,2/26/2024
The Impact of Derivatives Collateralization on Liquidity Risk: Evidence from the Investment Fund Sector,"Audrius Jukonis, Elisa Letizia, Linda Rousova","Stricter derivative margin requirements have increased the demand for liquid collateral, but euro area investment funds, which use derivatives extensively, have been reducing their liquid asset holdings. Using transaction-by-transaction derivatives data, we assess whether the current levels of funds’ holdings of cash and other highly liquid assets would be adequate to meet funds’ liquidity needs to cover variation margin calls on derivatives under a range of stress scenarios. The estimates indicate that between 13 percent and 33 percent of euro area funds with sizeable derivatives exposures may not have sufficient liquidity buffers to meet the calls under adverse market shocks. As a result, they are likely to redeem money market fund (MMF) shares, procyclically sell assets, and draw on credit lines, thus amplifying the market dynamics under such stress scenarios.

Difference-in-Differences in the Marketplace,Robert Minton and Casey B. Mulligan,"Price theory says that the most important effects of policy and technological change are often found beyond their first point of contact. This appears opposed to econometric methods that rule out spillovers of one person's treatment on another's outcomes. This paper uses the industry model from price theory to represent the statistical concepts of treatments and controls. When treated and control observations are in the same market, the controls are indirectly affected by the treatment. Moreover, even the effect of the treatment on the treated reveals only part of the consequence for the treated of treating the entire market, which is often the parameter of interest. Marshall's Laws of Derived Demand provide a guide for empirical work: precise price-theoretic interpretations of the direct and spillover effects of a treatment, the quantitative relationships between them, and how they correspond to the scale and substitution effects emphasized in price theory.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/difference-in-differences-in-the-marketplace.htm,2024-008,24-Feb,FED-BOARD,2/27/2024
Has Intergenerational Progress Stalled? Income Growth Over Five Generations of Americans,Kevin Corinth and Jeff Larrimore,"We find that each of the past four generations of Americans was better off than the previous one, using a post-tax, post-transfer income measure constructed annually from 1963-2022 based on the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement. At age 36–40, Millennials had a real median household income that was 18 percent higher than that of the previous generation at the same age. This rate of intergenerational progress was slower than that experienced by the Silent Generation (34 percent) and Baby Boomers (27 percent), but similar to that experienced by Generation X (16 percent). Slower progress for Generation X and Millennials is due to their stalled growth in work hours—holding work hours constant, they experienced a greater intergenerational increase in real market income than Baby Boomers. Intergenerational progress for Millennials under age 30 has remained robust as well, although their income growth largely results from higher reliance on their parents. We also find that the higher educational costs incurred by younger generations is far outweighed by their lifetime income gains.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/has-intergenerational-progress-stalled-income-growth-over-five-generations-of-americans.htm,2024-007,24-Feb,FED-BOARD,2/27/2024

We show that the time to develop is highly dispersed across locations, a finding that helps quantify the housing supply elasticity that is relevant for assessing local housing variations over the business cycle. We also show that incorporating long and dispersed time to develop into an otherwise standard housing investment model helps rationalize some empirical facts on the housing market.

Nonlinear Inflation Dynamics in Menu Cost Economies,"Andres Blanco, Corina Boar, Callum Jones, Virgiliu Midrigan","Canonical menu cost models, when parameterized to match the micro-price data, cannot reproduce the extent to which the fraction of price changes increases with inflation. They also predict implausibly large menu costs and misallocation in the presence of strategic complementarities. We resolve these shortcomings by extending the multiproduct menu cost model along two dimensions. First, the products sold by a firm are imperfect substitutes. Second, strategic complementarities are at the firm, not product level. In contrast to standard models, the fraction of price changes increases rapidly with the size of monetary shocks, so our model implies a non-linear Phillips curve.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/nonlinear-inflation-dynamics-in-menu-cost-economies.htm,2024-005,24-Feb,FED-BOARD,2/27/2024

Reexamining the 'Role of the Community Reinvestment Act in Mortgage Supply and the U.S. Housing Boom',Kenneth P. Brevoort,"Concerns have lingered since the 2007 subprime crisis that government housing policies promote risky mortgage lending. The first peer-reviewed evidence of a causal effect was published by the Review of Financial Studies in a paper (Saadi, 2020) linking the crisis to changes in the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in 1995. A review of that paper, however, shows that it misrepresents the policy changes as having taken effect in mid-1998, 2.5 years after they were implemented. When the correct timing is used, a similar analysis yields no evidence of a relationship between CRA and riskier mortgage lending. Instead, the results are shown to reflect an unrelated confounding event, the first collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market following Russia’s debt default in August 1998.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/reexamining-role-of-community-reinvestment-act-in-mortgage-supply-and-US-housing-boom.htm,2024-009,24-Feb,FED-BOARD,2/27/2024

What makes a job better?

Job changers also place more emphasis on their interest in their work than they do on pay and benefits in evaluating whether their new job is better. Parents particularly emphasize work-life balance, and we find some indications that mothers value it more than fathers.

Effects of Childhood Cognitive and Behavioral Disabilities on Adult Economic Outcomes,"Hope Corman, Kelly Noonan, Nancy Reichman","Developmental disabilities are not rare among U.S. children and rates have been increasing in recent decades. The increases have been driven by cognitive and behavioral disorders.  While some studies have investigated the effects of specific childhood conditions, particularly ADHD, on adult economic outcomes, none has considered the overall effects of cognitive and behavioral disabilities. We address this key gap by rigorously estimating effects of cognitive and behavioral impairments in childhood, which account for the bulk and increasing share of child disability cases in the U.S., on a set of salient adult economic outcomes. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79 Child Supplement, we estimate the effects of low cognitive test scores and high behavior problem scores in childhood on receipt of disability benefits, educational attainment, employment, wages, and access to transportation and credit in adulthood, using household fixed effects models to control for potentially confounding factors that are unobserved. We find significant effects in the expected direction for both cognitive and behavioral childhood disabilities on all outcomes.

Do Information Frictions and Corruption Perceptions Kill Competition? A Field Experiment on Public Procurement in Uganda,"Emanuele Colonnelli,  Francesco Loiacono, Edwin Muhumuza, Edoardo Teso","We study whether information frictions and corruption perceptions deter firms from doing business with the government. We conduct two nationwide randomized con-trolled trials (RCTs) in collaboration with the national public procurement supervisory and anti-corruption agency in Uganda. The first RCT aims to increase firms’ information on available procurement opportunities, which is limited due to the lack of a centralized e-procurement system. We provide firms with direct and timely access to information about government tenders over a two-year period. The second RCT focuses on firms’ perceptions about the integrity of public entities, which we experimentally show are key drivers of firms’ participation in procurement. We provide firms with access to structured information on other firms’ perceptions and on anti-corruption audits. We find that increasing information on available procurement opportunities alone does not increase firm participation in public procurement. However, changing firms’ perceptions about the integrity of public entities increases firms’ total number of bids and total government contracts won. Based on our findings, our partner agency implemented several measures to further restore firms’ trust in public entities.

What Drives Inflation? Lessons from Disaggregated Price Data,Elisa Rubbo,"The Covid pandemic disrupted supply chains and labor markets, with heterogeneous effects on demand and supply across industries. Meanwhile governments responded with unprecedented stimulus packages, and inflation increased to its highest values in 40 years. This paper investigates the contribution of aggregate monetary and fiscal policies to inflation compared to industry-specific disruptions. I argue that, in an economy where multiple industries and primary factors have heterogeneous supply curves, industry-specific shocks to inelastically supplied goods increase aggregate inflation beyond the control of monetary policy. Moreover, industry-specific and aggregate shocks have different effects on relative prices, which allows me to identify their respective contribution to aggregate inflation. For US consumer prices, I find that deflation and subsequent inflation in 2020 were due to industry-specific shocks, while since 2021 inflation is primarily driven by aggregate factors.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/what-drives-inflation-lessons-from-disaggregated-price-data/,2024-24,26-Feb-24,BFI,2/28/2024

Climate Change Economics over Time and Space,"Klaus Desmet, Esteban Rossi-Hansberg","With average temperature ranging from −20◦C at the North Pole to 30◦C at the Equator and with global warming expected to reach 1.4◦C to 4.5◦C by the year 2100, it is clear that climate change will have vastly different effects across the globe. Given the abundance of land in northern latitudes, if population and economic activity could freely move across space, the economic cost of global warming would be greatly reduced. But spatial frictions are real: migrants face barriers, trade and transportation are costly, physical infrastructure is not footloose, and knowledge embedded in clusters of economic activity diffuses only imperfectly. Thus, the economic cost of climate change is intimately connected to these spatial frictions. Building on earlier integrated assessment models that largely ignored space, in the past decade there has been significant progress in developing dynamic spatial integrated assessment models (S-IAMs) aimed at providing a more realistic evaluation of the economic cost of climate change, both locally and globally.

Competitive Job Seekers: When Sharing Less Leaves Firms at a Loss,"Gaurav Chiplunkar, Erin M. Kelley, Gregory Lane","We study how job-seekers share information about jobs within their social network, and its implications for firms. We randomly increase the amount of competition for a job and find that job-seekers are:(i) less likely to share information about the job with their peers; and (ii) choose to selectively share it with fewer higher ability peers. This lowers the quality of applicants received by firms, subsequent hires made, and performance on the job — suggesting that firms who rely on social networks to disseminate job information may see lower quality applicants than expected for their most competitive positions.

Price-Level Determination Under the Gold Standard,"Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Daniel Sanches","We present a micro-founded monetary model of a small open economy to examine the behavior of money, prices, and output under the gold standard. In particular, we formally analyze Hume’s celebrated price-specie flow mechanism. Our framework incorporates the influence of international trade on the money supply in the Home country through gold flows. In the short run, a positive correlation exists between the quantity of money and the price level. Additionally, we demonstrate that money is non-neutral during the transition to the steady state, which has implications for welfare. While the gold standard exposes the Home country to short-term fluctuations in money, prices, and output caused by external shocks, it ensures long-term price stability as the quantity of money and prices only temporarily deviate from their steady-state levels. We discuss the importance of policy coordination for achieving efficiency under the gold standard and consider the role of fiat money in this environment.

Climate Policies as a Catalyst for Green FDI,Samuel Pienknagura,"This paper assesses the role of climate policies as a catalyst of low carbon technologies deployment through foreign direct investment (FDI). Leveraging detailed cross-border project-level information, it identifies “green” FDI and finds that a higher number of active climate policies is associated with higher levels of green FDI inflows. Importantly, climate policies do not appear to be linked to lower levels of non-green projects, suggesting relatively small overall costs from the green transition. The paper also finds heterogeneity across sectors and policy instruments. The association between climate policies and green projects is particularly strong in energy and manufacturing, and when the composition of the recipient's climate portfolio is tilted towards binding policies (e.g., taxes and regulation) and expenditure measures. Finally, results point to policy spillovers, whereby larger climate policy portfolios in the source country are linked to higher green FDI outflows, but green subsidies can discourage them. This, in turn, implies that subsidies could hamper efforts to deploy low-carbon technologies across countries.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/01/Climate-Policies-as-a-Catalyst-for-Green-FDI-545450,WPIEA2024046,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/2/2024
Do Capital Inflows Spur Technology Diffusion? Evidence from a New Technology Adoption Index,"Gabriela Cugat, Andrea Manera","We construct a novel measure of technology adoption, the Embodied Technology Imports Indicator (ETI), available for 181 countries over the period 1970-2020. The ETI measures the technological intensity of imports of each country by leveraging patent data from PATSTAT and product-level trade data from COMTRADE. We use this index to assess the link between capital flows and the diffusion of new technologies across emerging economies and low-income countries. Through a local projection difference-in-differences approach, we establish that variations in statutory capital flow regulations increase technological intensity by 7-9 percentage points over 5 to 10 years.

Fiscal Implications of Global Decarbonization,"Simon Black, Ruud de Mooij, Vitor Gaspar, Ian W.H.

Such coordination could be initiated by large players, such as China, the US, India, the African Union, and the European Union. We find that the implications for fiscal revenues over time will be shaped by a combination of rising carbon prices, the gradual erosion of existing fuel tax bases, and possible revenue sharing arrangements. Public spending rises during the transition to build green public infrastructure, promote innovation, and support clean technology deployment. Countries will also need financing for compensating vulnerable households and industries, and to transfer funds to poor countries. With well-designed climate-fiscal policy relying on carbon pricing, global decarbonization will have anything from moderately positive to moderately negative impacts on fiscal balances in high-income countries.

Inflated Concerns: Exposure to Past Inflationary Episodes and Preferences for Price Stability,"Nicolas E Magud, Samuel Pienknagura","Using individual-level survey data for both advanced economies and emerging markets spanning over 45 years for 42 countries, we show that cohorts who have had higher exposure to past inflationary episodes (levels, as well as to more persistent or to more volatile inflation), systematically express higher concerns over rising prices. The link between past high inflation exposure and expressed concerns over price stability is particularly strong when an individual’s exposure occurs in the latter part of her working-age (as in lifecycle theory). The impact of past exposure to high inflation on contemporaneous preferences over price stability increases when surveyed in the midst of high ongoing inflation and with macroeconomic instability (as measured by GDP growth volatility), but diminishes with the quality of institutions.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/02/Inflated-Concerns-Exposure-to-Past-Inflationary-Episodes-and-Preferences-for-Price-Stability-545465,WPIEA2024040,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/2/2024
"Is Inflation Good for Business? The Firm-Level Impact of Inflation Shocks in the Baltics, 1997-2021","Serhan Cevik, Alice Fan, Sadhna Naik","Using a large panel of firm-level data, this paper provides an analysis of how inflation shocks in the Baltics between 1997 and 2021 affected total factor productivity (TFP), gross profitability, and net fixed investment in nonfinancial sectors. First, we find that inflation and inflation volatility had mixed effects on TFP growth, profitability and net fixed investment in the first year as well as over the medium term, albeit at a dissipating rate. Second, focusing on subsamples, we find that inflation shocks had differential effects on large versus small firms. Third, we explore sectoral heterogeneity in how firms responded to inflation shocks and observe significant variation across tradable and non-tradable sectors. Finally, estimates from a state-dependent model suggest that firms’ response to inflation shocks varied with the state of the economy. The results suggest that nonfinancial firms in the Baltics have been agile in adjusting to inflation shocks, possibly by either transferring higher production costs to consumers or substituting inputs. Given the differences in the level and nature of the recent inflation shock and the sample period on which our analysis is based, empirical findings presented in this paper might not necessarily apply to the latest bout of inflation in the Baltics.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/01/Is-Inflation-Good-for-Business-The-Firm-Level-Impact-of-Inflation-Shocks-in-the-Baltics-545501,WPIEA2024043,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/2/2024
Medium-term Macroeconomic Effects of Russia’s War in Ukraine and How it Affects Energy Security and Global Emission Targets,Hugo Rojas-Romagosa,"Russia’s war in Ukraine has disrupted the supply of natural gas for many European countries, triggering an energy crisis and affecting energy security. We simulate the medium-term effects of these trade disruptions and find that most European countries have limited GDP losses but those more dependent on Russian natural gas face moderate losses. European fossil fuel consumption and emissions are reduced and after accounting for the war impacts, achieving Europe’s emission targets becomes slightly less costly. In terms of energy security, the war eliminates European energy dependency from Russian imports, but most of the natural gas and oil imports will be substituted by other suppliers. We also find that constructing a new Russian pipeline to China does not provide significant macroeconomic benefits to either country.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/01/Medium-term-Macroeconomic-Effects-of-Russias-War-in-Ukraine-and-How-it-Affects-Energy-544043,WPIEA2024039,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/2/2024
The Consequences of Falling Behind the Curve: Inflation Shocks and Policy Delays Under Rational and Behavioral Expectations,"Mai Hakamada, Carl E. Walsh","Central banks in major industrialized economies were slow to react to the surge in inflation that began in early 2021. The proximate causes of this surge were the supply chain disruptions associated with the easing of COVID restrictions, fiscal policies designed to cushion the economic impact of COVID, and the impact on commodity prices and supply chains of the war in Ukraine. We investigate the consequences of policy delay in responding to inflation shocks. First, using a simple three-period model, we show how policy delay worsens inflation outcomes, but can mitigate or even reverse the output decline that occurs when policy responds without delay. Then, using a calibrated new Keynesian framework and two measures of loss that incorporate a “balanced approach” to weigh inflation and the output gap, we find that loss is monotonically increasing in the length of the delay. Loss is reduced if policy, when it does react, is more aggressive. To investigate whether these results are sensitive to the assumption of rational expectations, we consider cognitive discounting as an alternative assumption about expectations. With cognitive discounting, forward guidance is less powerful and results in a reduction in the costs of delay. Under either assumption about expectations, the costs of a short delay can be eliminated by adopting a less inertial policy rule and a more aggressive response to inflation.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/01/The-Consequences-of-Falling-Behind-the-Curve-Inflation-Shocks-and-Policy-Delays-Under-545507,WPIEA2024042,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/2/2024
Trade Spillovers of Domestic Subsidies,"Lorenzo Rotunno, Michele Ruta","As governments resort to industrial policies to achieve economic and non-economic objectives, the number of subsidies implemented each year has more than tripled in the last decade. Using detailed data across a large number of advanced and emerging economies, we empirically investigate the effects of domestic subsidies on international trade flows. Estimates from a difference-in-difference specification show that on average subsidies promote both exports and imports. These effects are partly driven by selection into subsidies, as governments target export-oriented and import-competing products. The results however mask significant differences across countries. Specifically, exports of subsidized products from G20 emerging markets increase 8 percent more than exports of other products, with no evidence of selection. The gravity estimates confirm that subsidies promote international relative to domestic trade. These spillover effects are concentrated in some industries, such as electrical machinery, and are stronger when subsidies are given through tax breaks than other policy instruments. The subsidy-led rise in trade calls for international cooperation to manage risks of retaliatory actions and possible drifts towards a subsidy war.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/01/Trade-Spillovers-of-Domestic-Subsidies-545453,WPIEA2024041,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/2/2024

Combining reduced-form estimates from tax data with a global investment model, we estimate responses, identify parameters, and conduct counterfactuals. Domestic investment of firms with the mean tax change increases 20% versus a no-change baseline. Due to novel foreign incentives, foreign capital of U.S. multinationals rises substantially. These incentives also boost domestic investment, indicating complementarity between domestic and foreign capital.

"Genetic Risk for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias: Cognition, Economic Behavior, and Clinically Actionable Information","Yeongmi Jeong, Nicholas W. Papageorge, Meghan Skira, Kevin Thom","Genetic factors play a major role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Observable genetic factors could impact household planning and medical care if they contain actionable information, meaning that they i) are associated with significant harms, ii) reflect risks for which individuals are not already prepared, and iii) are informative above and beyond current knowledge or expectations. We examine these properties for existing genetic measures related to ADRD in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We replicate existing relationships between genetic factors and cognitive health. We also show that higher genetic risk is associated with worse economic outcomes on several dimensions including work, income, and wealth. Surprisingly, individuals at higher risk are less likely to engage in planning activities that could mitigate the consequences of cognitive decline (e.g. assigning durable power of attorney). In predictive exercises, existing genetic indices provide clinically valuable and policy-relevant information on the development of severe adverse cognitive outcomes in the future.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32181,32181,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
The Role of Advertisers and Platforms in Monetizing Misinformation: Descriptive and Experimental Evidence,"Wajeeha Ahmad, Ananya Sen, Chuck Eesley, Erik Brynjolfsson","The financial motivation to earn advertising revenue by spreading misinformation has been widely conjectured to be among the main reasons misinformation continues to be prevalent online. Research aimed at reducing the spread of misinformation has so far focused on user-level interventions with little emphasis on how the supply of misinformation can itself be countered. In this work, we show how online misinformation is largely financially sustained via advertising, examine how financing misinformation affects the advertisers and ad platforms involved and outline ways of reducing the financing of misinformation. First, we find that advertising on misinformation outlets is pervasive for companies across several industries and is amplified by digital ad platforms that automatically distribute companies’ ads across the web. Using an information provision survey experiment, we show that people decrease their demand for a company’s products or services upon learning about its role in monetizing misinformation via online ads. To shed light on why misinformation continues to be monetized despite the potential backlash for the advertisers involved, we survey decision-makers at companies. We find that most decision-makers are unaware of their companies’ ads appearing on misinformation websites but have a strong preference to avoid appearing on such websites. Moreover, those uncertain and unaware about their role in financing misinformation increase their demand for a platform-based solution to reduce monetizing misinformation upon learning about how platforms amplify ad placement on misinformation websites. We identify low-cost, scalable information-based interventions that digital platforms could implement to reduce the financial incentive to misinform and counter the supply of misinformation online.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32187,32187,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
What Drives Inflation? Lessons from Disaggregated Price Data,Elisa Rubbo,"The Covid pandemic disrupted supply chains and labor markets, with heterogeneous effects on demand and supply across industries. Meanwhile governments responded with unprecedented stimulus packages, and inflation increased to its highest values in 40 years. This paper investigates the contribution of aggregate monetary and fiscal policies to inflation compared to industry-specific disruptions. I argue that, in an economy where multiple industries and primary factors have heterogeneous supply curves, industry-specific shocks to inelastically supplied goods increase aggregate inflation beyond the control of monetary policy. Moreover, industry-specific and aggregate shocks have different effects on relative prices, which allows me to identify their respective contribution to aggregate inflation. For US consumer prices, I find that deflation and subsequent inflation in 2020 were due to industry-specific shocks, while since 2021 inflation is primarily driven by aggregate factors.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32194,32194,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
Capital and Wages,Daron Acemoglu,"Does capital accumulation increase labor demand and wages? Neoclassical production functions, where capital and labor are q-complements, ensure that the answer is yes, so long as labor markets are competitive. This result critically depends on the assumption that capital accumulation does not change the technologies being developed and used. I adapt the theory of endogenous technological change to investigate this question when technology also responds to capital accumulation. I show that there are strong parallels between the relationship between capital and wages and existing results on the conditions under which equilibrium factor demands are upward-sloping (e.g., Acemoglu, 2007). Extending this framework, I provide intuitive conditions and simple examples where a greater capital stock leads to lower wages, because it triggers more automation. I then offer an endogenous growth model with a menu of technologies where equilibrium involves choices over both the extent of automation and the rate of growth of labor-augmenting productivity. In this framework, capital accumulation and technological change in the long run are associated with wage growth, but an increase in the saving rate increases the extent of automation, and at first reduces the wage rate and subsequently depresses its long-run growth rate.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32190,32190,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
Welfare and the Act of Choosing,"B.

We address this problem by developing an approach that redefines consumption bundles in terms of the sensations they produce, and measures welfare by blending choice-based methods with self-reported well-being techniques. In applications to classic social preferences paradigms, our approach shows that standard revealed-preference methods, including those that exploit choices over menus, mismeasure welfare because preferences depend on choice sets, while self-reported happiness and satisfaction are not sufficient statistics for welfare.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32200,32200,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
A Supply Curve for Forest-Based CO₂ Removal,"Sergio L. Franklin Jr., Robert S. Pindyck","Forestation is viewed as an important means of removing CO₂ from the atmosphere and thereby reducing net CO₂ emissions. But how much CO₂ can be removed, and at what cost? Focusing on forested and forestable areas in South America, and using spatially disaggregated data, we estimate a supply curve for forest-based atmospheric CO₂ removal. The supply curve traces out the marginal cost of removing a metric ton of CO₂ as a function of total annual CO₂ removal. Each point on the curve corresponds to a specific location, and accounts for land opportunity costs as well as costs of tree planting and maintenance. We show that over a billion tons of CO₂ can be removed annually via forestation at a cost below $45 per ton, and about 2.5 billion tons can be removed at a cost below $90 per ton. The supply curve applies to only South America, but with sufficient data could be extended to the entire world.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32207,32207,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
Appropriate Entrepreneurship? The Rise of China and the Developing World,"Josh Lerner, Junxi Liu, Jacob Moscona, David Y. Yang","Global innovation and entrepreneurship has traditionally been dominated by a handful of high-income countries, especially the US. This paper investigates the international consequences of the rise of a new hub for innovation, focusing on the dramatic growth of high-potential entrepreneurship and venture capital in China. First, using comprehensive data on global venture activities, we show that as the Chinese venture industry rose in importance, entrepreneurship increased substantially in other emerging markets, particularly in sectors dominated by Chinese companies. Using a broad set of country-level economic indicators, we find that this effect was driven by country-sector pairs most similar to their counterparts in China. Second, turning to mechanisms, we show that the baseline findings are driven by local investors and by new firms that more closely resemble existing Chinese companies. Third, we find that this growth in emerging-market investment had wide-ranging positive consequences, including a rise in serial entrepreneurship, cross-sector spillovers, innovation, and broader measures of socioeconomic well-being. Together, our findings suggest that developing countries benefited from more “appropriate” businesses and technology pioneered by China, and that a system where only rich countries lead in innovation could limit entrepreneurial activity in large parts of the world.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32193,32193,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
"Inequality Within Countries is Falling: Underreporting-Robust Estimates of World Poverty, Inequality and the Global Distribution of Income","Maxim Pinkovskiy, Xavier Sala-i-Martin, Kasey Chatterji-Len, William H. Nober","Household surveys suffer from persistent and growing underreporting. We propose a novel procedure to adjust reported survey incomes for underreporting by estimating a model of misreporting whose main parameter of interest is the elasticity of regional national accounts income to regional survey income, which is closely related to the elasticity of underreporting with respect to income. We find this elasticity to be substantial but roughly constant over time, implying a large but relatively constant correction to survey-derived inequality estimates. Underreporting of income by the bottom 50% of the world income distribution has become particularly important in recent decades. We reconfirm the findings of the literature that global poverty and inequality have declined dramatically between 1980 and 2019. Finally, we find that within-country inequality is falling on average, and has been largely constant since the 1990s.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32203,32203,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
The Distributional Effects of Asset Returns,"Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Oren Levintal","We study the distributional effects of asset returns using a heterogeneous-agent model estimated to match the joint distribution of wealth and returns. In the model, endogenous portfolio decisions play a key role through their impact on households' wealth accumulation. We find substantial welfare effects of changes in asset returns. A permanent decline of one percentage point in expected returns increases the consumption share of the top 10% by 6% permanently. Our findings suggest that lower returns increase inequality, which contradicts Piketty's (2014) r-g formula. To resolve this contradiction, we derive a generalized formula that includes the consumption/wealth ratio and which is consistent with our empirical and theoretical findings. Nonetheless, wealth inequality within the Pareto tail is fairly insensitive to asset returns. Instead, inequality between the Pareto tail and the lower range of the distribution responds strongly to asset returns through their differential effects on active savings relative to wealth. Simulations suggest that asset price dynamics can explain the main variations in U.S. top wealth shares since the 1960s.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32182,32182,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
International Trade and Macroeconomic Dynamics with Sanctions,"Fabio Ghironi, Daisoon Kim, G. Kemal Ozhan","We study international trade and macroeconomic dynamics triggered by the imposition of sanctions. We begin with a tractable two-country model where Home and Foreign countries have comparative advantages in production of differentiated consumption goods and a commodity (e.g., gas), respectively. Home imposes sanctions on Foreign. Financial sanctions exclude a fraction of Foreign agents from the international bond market. Gas sanctions take the form of a ban on gas trade, equivalent to an appropriate price cap in our model. Differentiated goods trade sanctions exclude a fraction of Foreign and Home exporters from international trade. All sanctions lead to resource reallocation in both economies. Exchange rate movements reflect the direction of reallocation and the type of sanctions imposed rather than the success of the sanctions. Welfare analysis shows that gas sanctions are more costly for Home, while differentiated consumption goods trade sanctions are more costly for Foreign. A third country that refrains from joining the sanctions mitigates welfare losses in Foreign, but refraining from joining the sanctions is beneficial for the third country. These findings highlight the importance and the difficulty of international coordination when imposing sanctions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32188,32188,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
Temperature Extremes Impact Mortality and Morbidity Differently,"Carlos F. Gould, Sam Heft-Neal, Alexandra K. Heaney, Eran Bendavid, Christopher W. Callahan, Mathew Kiang, Joshua S. Graff Zivin, Marshall Burke","Increased temperature-related mortality is predicted to be one of the largest contributors to future economic damages from climate change globally, with declines in cold-related deaths in some regions outweighed by increases in heat-related deaths in others. Changes in temperature could also affect non-fatal health outcomes, whose aggregate societal burden is large, yet much less is known about how temperature affects the overall level and distribution of morbidity. Using georeferenced data on emergency department visits, mortality, and daily temperatures across California from 2006-2017, we show that the effect of temperature on mortality differs substantially from its effect on ED visits: mortality increases under extreme heat and cold, whereas ED visits increase under extreme heat but decline under extreme cold. These differential responses fundamentally shape the burden of future climate change: we predict that mortality in California will decrease by 0.32% due to changes in temperatures by mid-century, with declining cold deaths outweighing increasing heat deaths, but that ED visits will increase by 0.46% over the same period in the state, representing a total of 1.9 million excess visits. Our findings suggest that projected impacts of future warming on mortality, including benefits in many areas, might be a poor guide for morbidity impacts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32195,32195,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
Optimal Urban Transportation Policy: Evidence from Chicago,"Milena Almagro, Felipe Barbieri, Juan Camilo Castillo, Nathaniel G. Hickok, Tobias Salz","We characterize optimal urban transportation policies in the presence of congestion and environmental externalities and evaluate their welfare and distributional effects. We present a framework of a municipal government that implements different transportation equilibria through its choice of public transit policies—prices and frequencies—as well as road pricing. The government faces a budget constraint that introduces monopoly-like distortions. We apply this framework to Chicago, for which we construct a new dataset that comprehensively captures transportation choices. We find that road pricing alone leads to large welfare gains by reducing externalities, but at the expense of consumers (travelers), whose surplus falls even if road pricing revenues are fully rebated. The largest losses are borne by middle income consumers, who are most reliant on cars. We find that the optimal price of public transit is close to zero and goes along with a reduction in the frequency of buses and an increase in the frequency of trains. Combining these transit policies with road pricing eliminates budget constraints. This allows the government to implement higher transit frequencies and even lower prices, in which case consumer surplus increases after rebates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32185,32185,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
Why Survey-Based Subjective Expectations are Meaningful and Important,"Francesco D’Acunto, Michael Weber","For decades, households' subjective expectations elicited via surveys have been considered meaningless because they often differ substantially from the forecasts of professionals and ex-post realizations. In sharp contrast, the literature we review shows household characteristics and the ways in which households collect and process economic information help us understand previously-considered puzzling facts about their subjective expectations. In turn, subjective expectations contribute to explain heterogeneous consumption, saving, investment, and debt choices as well as different reactions by similar households to the same monetary and fiscal policy measures. Matching microdata on households' characteristics with the price signals the same households observe, their subjective expectations, and their real-world economic decisions is crucial to establishing these facts. Our growing understanding of households' subjective expectations inspires several theoretical and empirical research directions and begets the design of innovative and more effective policy instruments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32199,32199,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
Climate Change Economics over Time and Space,"Klaus Desmet, Esteban Rossi-Hansberg","With average temperature ranging from -20°C at the North Pole to 30°C at the Equator and with global warming expected to reach 1.4°C to 4.5°C by the year 2100, it is clear that climate change will have vastly different effects across the globe. Given the abundance of land in northern latitudes, if population and economic activity could freely move across space, the economic cost of global warming would be greatly reduced. But spatial frictions are real: migrants face barriers, trade and transportation are costly, physical infrastructure is not footloose, and knowledge embedded in clusters of economic activity diffuses only imperfectly. Thus, the economic cost of climate change is intimately connected to these spatial frictions. Building on earlier integrated assessment models that largely ignored space, in the past decade there has been significant progress in developing dynamic spatial integrated assessment models (S-IAMs) aimed at providing a more realistic evaluation of the economic cost of climate change, both locally and globally. This review article discusses this progress and provides a guide for future work in this area.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32197,32197,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024

The How and Why of Household Reactions to Income Shocks,"Roberto Colarieti, Pierfrancesco Mei, Stefanie Stantcheva","This paper studies how and why households adjust their spending, saving, and borrowing in response to transitory income shocks. We leverage new large-scale survey data to first quantitatively assess households’ intertemporal marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) and deleverage (MPDs) (the “how”), and second to dive into the motivations and decision-making processes across households (the “why”). The combination of the quantitative estimation of household response dynamics with a qualitative exploration of the mental models employed during financial decisions provides a more complete view of household behavior. Our findings are as follows: First, we validate the reliability of surveys in predicting actual economic behaviors using a new approach called cross-validation, which compares the responses to hypothetical financial scenarios with observed actions from past studies. Participants’ predicted reactions closely align with real-life behaviors. Second, we show that MPCs are significantly higher immediately following an income shock and diminish over time, with cumulative MPCs over a year showing significant variability. However, MPDs play a critical role in household financial adjustments and display significantly more cross-sectional heterogeneity. Neither is easily explained by socioeconomic or financial characteristics alone, and the explanatory power is improved by adding psychological factors, past experiences, and expectations. Third, using specifically-designed survey questions, we find that there is a broad range of motivations behind households’ financial decisions and identify four household types using machine learning: Strongly Constrained, Precautionary, Quasi-Smoothers, and Spenders. Similar financial actions stem from diverse reasons, challenging the predictability of financial behavior solely based on socioeconomic and financial characteristics. Finally, we use our findings to address some puzzles in household finance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32191,32191,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
Innovation: The Bright Side of Common Ownership?,"Miguel Antón, Florian Ederer, Mireia Giné, Martin C. Schmalz","Firms have inefficiently low incentives to innovate when other firms benefit from their inventions and the innovating firm therefore does not capture the full surplus of its innovations. We show that common ownership of firms mitigates this impediment to corporate innovation. By contrast, without technological spillovers, innovation has the effect of stealing market share from rivals; in that case, more common ownership reduces innovation. Empirically,  the association between common ownership and innovation inputs and outputs decreases with product market proximity and increases with technology proximity. The sign and magnitude of the overall relationship between common ownership and corporate innovation thus varies considerably across the universe of firms depending on their relative proximity in technology and product market space. These results persist if we use only variation from BlackRock's acquisition of BGI. Our results inform the debate about the welfare effects of increasing common ownership among U.S. corporations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32192,32192,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024

Do For-Profit Hospitals Cream-Skim Patients? Evidence from Inpatient Psychiatric Care in California,"Donghoon Lee, Anirban Basu, Jerome A. Dugan, Pinar Karaca-Mandic","The paper examines whether, among inpatient psychiatric admissions in California, for-profit (FP) hospitals engage in cream skimming, i.e., choosing patients for some characteristic(s) other than their need for care, which enhances the profitability of the provider. We propose a novel approach to identify cream skimming using cost outcomes. Naïve treatment effect estimates of hospital ownership type consist of the impact of differential patient case mix (selection) and hospital cost containment strategies (execution). In contrast, an instrumental variable (IV) approach can control for case mix and establish the causal effects of ownership type due to its execution. We interpret the difference in naïve and IV treatment effects to be driven by FP hospitals’ selection (cream skimming) based on unobserved patient case mix. We find that FP hospitals are more likely to treat high-cost patients than not-for-profit (NFP) hospitals, showing no evidence that FP hospitals engage in cream skimming. Our results may alleviate concerns surrounding the recent proliferation of FP psychiatric hospitals with regards to cream skimming.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32179,32179,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024

This short paper lays out the hurdles for debt to overcome to be a viable source of finance and casts the three types of venture debt – patent loans, venture leverage, and bridge loans – as solutions to such hurdles, casting the literature in terms of financial innovation. Finally, the paper addresses the risks implied by venture debt and discusses whether the demise of Silicon Valley Bank speaks to whether innovation ecosystem risk transmutes to the financial system through debt and the extent to which innovation ecosystem risk remains unstudied.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32183,32183,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024
Is There Information in Corporate Acquisition Plans?,"Sinan Gokkaya, Xi Liu, René M. Stulz","For many firms, the acquisition process begins with the development of an acquisition plan that is communicated to investors. We construct a comprehensive sample of acquisition plans to provide novel perspectives on the acquisition process and find that acquisition plans are informative to investors and incrementally predict subsequent acquisition activity. These results are more pronounced for firms announcing their commitment to acquisitions from an internal pipeline. Acquisition plans improve acquisition performance due to learning from market feedback and alleviate acquisition-related market uncertainty. Communication of acquisition plans does not increase takeover premiums but is less common in more competitive industries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32201,32201,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024

Testa, Liyang Zhou","In applied historical research, geographic units often differ in level of aggregation across datasets. One solution is to use crosswalks that associate factors located within one geographic unit to another, based on their relative areas. We develop an alternative approach based on relative populations, which accounts for heterogeneities in urbanization within counties. We construct population-based crosswalks for 1790 through 2020, which map county-level data across U.S. censuses, as well as from counties to congressional districts.

Long Term Care Risk for Couples and Singles,"Elena Capatina, Gary Hansen, Minchung Hsu","This paper compares the impact of long term care (LTC) risk on single and married households and studies the roles played by informal care (IC), consumption sharing within households, and Medicaid in insuring this risk. We develop a life-cycle model where individuals face survival and health risk, including the possibility of becoming highly disabled and needing LTC. Households are heterogeneous in various important dimensions including education, productivity, and the age difference between spouses. Health evolves stochastically. Agents make consumption-savings decisions in a framework featuring an LTC state-dependent utility function. We find that household expenditures increase significantly when LTC becomes necessary, but married individuals are well insured against LTC risk due to IC. However, they still hold considerable assets due to the concern for the spouse who might become a widow/widower and can expect much higher LTC costs. IC significantly reduces precautionary savings for middle and high income groups, but interestingly, it encourages asset accumulation among low income groups because it reduces the probability of means-tested Medicaid LTC.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32196,32196,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024

Uncertainty or Frictions? A Quantitative Model of Scarce Safe Assets,"Cosmin L.

This paper assesses the role of uncertainty and credit market frictions. We quantify a model with heterogeneous households using data on asset prices and macro aggregates, as well as on households' debt and equity positions. We find that compensation for both uncertainty and frictions is reflected in asset prices.

Friends with Benefits: Social Capital and Household Financial Behavior,"Brad Cannon, David Hirshleifer, Joshua Thornton","Using friendship data from Facebook, we study the effects of three aspects of social capital on household financial behavior. We find that the most important measure of social capital in explaining stock market and saving participation is Economic Connectedness, defined as the fraction of one’s social network with high socioeconomic status. One standard-deviation greater Economic Connectedness is associated with 2.9% greater stock market participation and 5.0% greater saving participation. Compared to Cohesiveness or Civic Engagement, Economic Connectedness explains more than 6 times the variation in stock market participation and more than 4 times the variation in saving participation. Using data on nonlocal friendships, we provide evidence supporting a causal link between household financial behavior and the income of one's friends. Furthermore, we provide evidence that greater opportunities for social interaction with wealthy individuals is associated with increased stock market and saving participation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32186,32186,24-Mar,NBER,3/4/2024

In the model, as in reality, homebuyers enjoy free house showings without having to pay their agents out of pocket. Buyers' agents receive a commission equal to 3% of the house price only after a home is purchased.

Schooling and Political Activism in the Early Civil Rights Era,"Daniel Aaronson, Mark Borgschulte, Sunny Liu, Bhash Mazumder",Does education lead to political engagement? The empirical literature is mixed. Theory suggests economic context matters. Individuals unable to take advantage of education in the labor market are more likely to engage in political activity. We find support for this channel during the rapid expansion of NAACP branches in the South around WWII. Branch growth was stronger where Black workers were denied returns to schooling due to Jim Crow occupational discrimination. We further show that a pre-1931 large-scale school construction program caused greater NAACP activity during the 1940s and 1950s when many former students were in their prime working years.,https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-06,2024-06,24-Mar,FED-CHICAGO,3/5/2024
The Unemployment-Inflation Trade-off Revisited: The Phillips Curve in COVID Times,"Richard K.

While the bulk of the inflation surge is attributed to temporary supply factors, we also find an important role for current and expected negative unemployment gaps. Through the lens of the model, the 2022-23 disinflation was driven by the expectation that the unemployment gap will close through a progressive decline in ut* and a rise in the unemployment rate. This implies that convergence to long-run price stability depends critically on expectations about labor market tightness.

Why Survey-Based Subjective Expectations are Meaningful and Important,"Francesco D’Acunto, Michael Weber","For decades, households’ subjective expectations elicited via surveys have been considered meaningless because they often differ substantially from the forecasts of professionals and ex-post realizations. In sharp contrast, the literature we review shows household characteristics and the ways in which households collect and process economic information help us understand previously-considered puzzling facts about their subjective expectations. In turn, subjective expectations contribute to explain heterogeneous consumption, saving, investment, and debt choices as well as different reactions by similar households to the same monetary and fiscal policy measures. Matching microdata on households’ characteristics with the price signals the same households observe, their subjective expectations, and their real-world economic decisions is crucial to establishing these facts. Our growing understanding of households’ subjective expectations inspires several theoretical and empirical research directions and begets the design of innovative and more effective policy instruments.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/why-survey-based-subjective-expectations-are-meaningful-and-important/,2024-28,4-Mar-24,BFI,3/7/2024

Simulations reveal that Random Forest generally outperforms Gradient Boosted Regression Trees when signals are weak.

We conducted a large-scale, 4-year trial that randomized premiums and subsidies for India’s first national, public hospital insurance program, RSBY. We find roughly 60% uptake even when consumers were charged premiums equal to the government’s cost for insurance. We also find substantial adverse selection into insurance at positive prices. Insurance enrollment increases insurance utilization, partly due to spillovers from use of insurance by neighbors. However, many enrollees attempted to use insurance but failed, suggesting that learning is critical to the success of public insurance. We find very few statistically significant impacts of insurance access or enrollment on health. Because there is substantial willingness-to-pay for insurance, and given how distortionary it is to raising revenue in the Indian context, we calculate that our sample population should be charged a premium for RSBY between INR 500-1000 rather than a zero premium to maximize the marginal value of public funds.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/evaluating-and-pricing-health-insurance-in-lower-income-countries-a-field-experiment-in-india/,2024-27,4-Mar-24,BFI,3/7/2024
Trade Risk and Food Security,Tasso Adamopoulos and Fernando Leibovici,"We study the role of international trade risk for food security, the patterns of production and trade across sectors, and its implications for policy. We document that food import dependence across countries is associated with higher food insecurity, particularly in low-income countries. We provide causal evidence on the role of trade risk for food security by exploiting the exogeneity of the Ukraine-Russia war as a major trade disruption limiting access to imports of critical food products. Using micro-level data from Ethiopia, we empirically show that districts relatively more exposed to food imports from the conflict countries experienced a significant increase in food insecurity by consuming fewer varieties of foods. Motivated by this evidence, we develop a multi-country multi-sector model of trade and structural change with stochastic trade costs to study the impact and policy implications of trade risk. In the model, importers operate subject to limited liability and trade off the production cost advantage against the risk of higher trade costs when sourcing goods internationally. We find that trade risk can threaten food security, with substantial quantitative effects on trade flows and the sectoral composition of economic activity. We study the desirability of trade policy and production subsidies in partially mitigating exposure to trade risk and diversifying domestic economic activity.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-004,2024-004A,24-Mar,FED-STLOUIS,3/7/2024
Would the Euro Area Benefit from Greater Labor Mobility?,"Vasco Cúrdia, Fernanda Nechio","We assess how within euro area labor mobility impacts economic dynamics in response to shocks. In the analysis we use an estimated two-region monetary union dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that allows for a varying degree of labor mobility across regions. We find that, in contrast with traditional optimal currency area predictions, enhanced labor mobility can either mitigate or exacerbate the extent to which the two regions respond differently to shocks. The effects depend crucially on the nature of shocks and variable of interest. In some circumstances, even when it contributes to aligning the responses of the two regions, labor mobility may complicate monetary policy tradeoffs. Moreover, the presence and strength of financial frictions have important implications for the effects of labor mobility. If the periphery’s risk premium is more responsive to its indebtedness than our estimates, there are various shocks for which labor mobility may help stabilize the economy.

Drivers of Dollar Share in Foreign Exchange Reserves,Linda S. Goldberg and Oliver Zain Hannaoui,"The share of U.S. dollar assets in the official foreign exchange reserve portfolios of central banks is sometimes taken as an indicator of dollar status. We show that the observed decline in the aggregate share of U.S. dollar assets does not stem from a systematic shift in currency preferences away from holding dollar assets. Instead, a small group of countries with large foreign exchange reserve balances drive the dollar share decline observed in aggregate statistics. This arises either due to countries conducting monetary policy vis-à-vis the euro or due to preference shifts away from dollars. Regression analysis shows that interest rate differentials between traditional and nontraditional reserve currencies can tilt portfolio composition, particularly in relation to the scale of investment tranches within overall central bank portfolios. Geopolitical distance from the United States and financial sanctions are associated with lower U.S. dollar shares, especially if the primary foreign currency liquidity needs of the central bank are already satisfied.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1087,1087,3/2/2024,FED-NEWYORK,3/9/2024

Battle of the markups: conflict inflation and the aspirational channel of monetary policy transmission,Frederick van der Ploeg and Tim Willems,"By Frederick van der Ploeg and Tim Willems

Since the post‑Covid rise in inflation has been accompanied by strong wage growth, the distributional conflict between wage and price‑setters (both wishing to attain a certain markup) has regained prominence. We examine how a central bank should resolve a ‘battle of the markups’ when aspired markups are cyclically sensitive, highlighting a new ‘aspirational channel’ of monetary transmission. We establish conditions under which an inflationary situation characterised by inconsistent aspirations requires a reduction in economic activity, to eliminate worker‑firm disagreement over the appropriate level of the real wage. We find that countercyclical markups and/or a flat Phillips curve call for more dovish monetary policy. Estimating price markup cyclicality across 44 countries, we find that monetary contractions are better able to lower inflation when markups are procyclical.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/battle-of-the-markups-conflict-inflation-and-the-aspirational-channel-of-mp-transmission,1065,"Fri, 08 Mar 2",BOE,3/9/2024
Energy and climate policy in a DSGE model of the United Kingdom,Sandra Batten and Stephen Millard,"We build an open economy Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model with energy and use it to simulate the impact of different climate policies – specifically the introduction of a carbon tax and bans on petrol or gas usage by households – on macroeconomic variables. We show how the introduction of a carbon tax leads to falls in both households’ consumption of energy and firms’ use of energy in production, while also having the effect of shifting the production of electricity from fossil fuels to renewable sources. The effects of a ban on household consumption of petrol or gas depend crucially on the elasticity of substitution between different energy sources in consumption. For very low elasticities of substitution, a ban on petrol or gas usage also led households to cut down on their use of electricity, whereas for larger elasticities of substitution, households switched into electricity. Regardless of the elasticity of substitution, aggregate consumption fell on impact in response to the bans before rising over time. GDP and the gross output of non‑energy fall in response to both a carbon tax and a ban on petrol or gas consumption by households.

Movies,"Stelios Michalopoulos, Christopher Rauh","Why are certain movies more successful in some markets than others?

These questions drive our investigation into the relationship between a society’s oral tradition and the financial success of films. We combine a unique catalog of local tales, myths, and legends around the world with data on international movie screenings and revenues. First, we quantify the similarity between movies’ plots and traditional motifs employing machine learning techniques. Comparing the same movie across different markets, we establish that films that resonate more with local folklore systematically accrue higher revenue and are more likely to be screened. Second, we document analogous patterns within the US. Google Trends data reveal a pronounced interest in markets where ancestral narratives align more closely with a movie’s theme. Third, we delve into the explicit values transmitted by films, concentrating on the depiction of risk and gender roles. Films that promote risk-taking sell more in entrepreneurial societies today, rooted in traditions where characters pursue dangerous tasks successfully. Films portraying women in stereotypical roles continue to find a robust audience in societies with similar gender stereotypes in their folklore and where women today continue being relegated to subordinate positions.

Product Liability Litigation and Innovation: Evidence from Medical Devices,"Alberto Galasso, Hong Luo","We examine the relationship between product liability litigation and innovation by systematically combining data on product liability lawsuits with data on new product introductions in a panel dataset of leading medical device firms. We first document a decline in the propensity to introduce new products for both defendant firms and other firms operating in litigated device categories. This decline, however, does not spill over to other device categories, and we also do not find any slowing down in firms' patenting activities. We then show that changes in two features of the regulatory environment---(1) the availability of public information regarding adverse events and (2) federal law taking precedence over state law---substantially affect the likelihood of litigation. These changes also provide quasi-exogenous variations in litigation that confirm our baseline findings. Finally, we show that litigation appears to induce firms to develop safer devices. Overall, our findings suggest that product liability litigation affects the rate and direction of technological progress, and that safety regulation and liability regimes interact with one another in significant ways.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32215,32215,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
On Recoding Ordered Treatments as Binary Indicators,"Evan K. Rose, Yotam Shem-Tov",Researchers using instrumental variables to investigate ordered treatments often recode treatment into an indicator for any exposure. We investigate this estimand under the assumption that the instruments shift compliers from no treatment to some but not from some treatment to more. We show that when there are extensive margin compliers only (EMCO) this estimand captures a weighted average of treatment effects that can be partially unbundled into each complier group's potential outcome means. We also establish an equivalence between EMCO and a two-factor selection model and apply our results to study treatment heterogeneity in the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w32234,32234,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
The Market and Climate Implications of U.S. LNG Exports,"James H. Stock, Matthew Zaragoza-Watkins","From 2015 to 2023, the United States transformed from a net importer of natural gas to the world's largest liquified natural gas (LNG) exporter. We find that this surge in LNG exports has reconnected U.S. gas prices to world market prices, after a hiatus of “shut-in” fracked gas. We estimate that the domestic gas price effect of this recoupling is comparable to a $30/ton carbon tax. For coal prices, which are coupled to gas through competition in the power sector, this effect is comparable to a $20/ton carbon tax. Using the NREL ReEDS model, we estimate that this recoupling reduces U.S. 2030 power sector CO2 emissions by roughly 145 million metric tons. These domestic estimates contribute to estimating the overall climate impact of LNG exports.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32228,32228,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
"Housing Speculation, GSEs, and Credit Market Spillovers","Natee Amornsiripanitch, Philip E. Strahan, Song Zhang, Xiang Zheng","In 2021, the U.S. Treasury reduced Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) exposure to speculative mortgages.  As a result, GSE purchases fell by about 20 percentage points.  The policy reduced credit to speculative investors in housing, but increased credit to unaffected parts of the conforming-mortgage market. Banks responded by reallocating provision of speculative mortgage credit across their local markets, which in turn affected their provision of small business credit.  These adjustments are most pronounced where banks do not own branches.  The results suggest that banks manage credit provision not only in a macro sense – the focus of most research – but also market-by-market.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32209,32209,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
The Puzzling Persistence of Financial Crises,"Charles W. Calomiris, Matthew S. Jaremski","The high social costs of financial crises imply that economists, policymakers, businesses, and households have a tremendous incentive to understand, and try to prevent them. And yet, so far we have failed to learn how to avoid them. In this article, we take a novel approach to studying financial crises. We first build ten case studies of financial crises that stretch over two millennia, and then consider their salient points of differences and commonalities. We see this as the beginning of developing a useful taxonomy of crises – an understanding of the most important factors that reappear across the many examples, which also allows (as in any taxonomy) some examples to be more similar to each other than others. From the perspective of our review of the ten crises, we consider the question of why it has proven so difficult to learn from past crises to avoid future ones.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32213,32213,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
Non-Binary Gender Economics,"Katherine B. Coffman, Lucas C. Coffman, Keith Marzilli Ericson","Economics research has largely overlooked non-binary individuals. We aim to jump-start the literature by providing data on several economically-important beliefs and preferences. Among many results, non-binary individuals report more gender-based discrimination and express different career and life aspirations, including less desire for children. Anti-non-binary sentiment is stronger than anti-LGBT sentiment, and strongest among men. Non-binary respondents report lower assertiveness than men and women, and their social preferences are similar to men’s and less prosocial than women’s, with age an important moderator.

"On the Feasibility, Costs, and Benefits of an Immediate Phasedown of Coal for U.S. Electricity Generation","Stephen P. Holland, Matthew Kotchen, Erin T. Mansur, Andrew J. Yates","The phasedown of coal for electricity generation is considered vital to meeting global climate targets. Many countries have pledged to stop using coal, with some as early as 2030. While the United States has no target currently in place, several states do. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of phasing down U.S. coal-generated electricity given the existing fleet of power plants. In particular, we take consumption as given and evaluate how prioritizing natural gas generation over that of coal would change emissions and operating costs. To do this, we develop a replacement algorithm based on transmission regions and marginal cost comparisons. Using our preferred scenarios, we find that between 66 and 94 percent of coal generation could be replaced immediately, reducing electricity sector carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions between 18 and 29 percent – equivalent to between 5 and 8 percent of total U.S. energy related emissions. The cost range is between $49 and $92 per ton of CO₂, where benefit-cost ratios are favorable in some scenarios considering local pollutant co-benefits alone. Despite the command-and-control nature of prioritizing natural gas generation, we find it relatively cost effective even in comparison to a Pigouvian tax. We examine sensitivity of the results to transmission regions, replacement cost conditions, natural gas pipeline capacity, and alternative fuel prices.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32235,32235,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
Driving Under the Influence of Allergies: The Effect of Seasonal Pollen on Traffic Fatalities,"Shooshan Danagoulian, Monica Deza","Traffic fatalities are the leading cause of mortality in the United States despite being preventable. While several policies have been introduced to improve traffic safety and their effects have been well documented, the role of transitory health shocks or situational factors at explaining variations in fatal traffic accidents has been understudied. Exploring daily variation in city-specific pollen counts, this study finds novel evidence that traffic fatalities increase on days in which the local pollen count are particularly high. We find that the effects are present in accidents involving private vehicles and occur most frequently on the weekends, suggesting potentially the missed opportunity to avoid these fatalities. We do not find similar effects for fleet vehicles. These findings remain robust to alternative specifications and alternative definitions of high pollen count. Taken together, this study finds evidence that a prevalent and transitory exogenous health-shock, namely pollen allergies, increases traffic fatalities. Given our lack of evidence of avoidance, these effects are not mechanical and are likely driven by cognitive impairments that arise as a result of seasonal allergies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32233,32233,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
The Feasibility of Using Bayh-Dole March-In Rights to Lower Drug Prices: An Update,"Lisa Larrimore Ouellette, Bhaven N. Sampat","In December 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration released a proposed framework for exercising government “march-in” rights on high-priced taxpayer-funded drugs. While both proponents and critics of the new rules view them as having broad scope, march-in rights can be exercised only on patents that result from federally funded research, and they can enable generic entry only if all patents on a drug were public-sector patents. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of using march-in rights to lower pharmaceutical prices by examining patents on drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 1985 to 2022. Our primary analyses focus on the 883 new molecular entities with at least one patent listed in the FDA’s Orange Book since 1985. While 9 percent of these drugs have a public-sector patent, only 2.5 percent have only public-sector patents. While the new march-in rules could be a tool to lower prices for a few drugs, their overall impact on prices or expenditures will likely be limited. In addition to the updated analyses, we provide links to the data used in the analyses.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32217,32217,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
Sectoral Development Multipliers,"Francisco J. Buera, Nicholas Trachter","How should industrial policies be directed to reduce distortions and foster economic development? We study this question in a multi-sector model with technology adoption, where the production of goods and modern technologies features rich network structures. We provide simple formulas for the sectoral policy multipliers, and provide insights regarding the power of alternative policy instruments. We devise a simple procedure to estimate the model parameters and the distribution of technologies across sectors, which we apply to Indian data. We find that technology adoption greatly amplifies the multipliers' magnitudes, and it changes the ranking of priority sectors for industrial policy. Further, we find that adoption subsidies are the most cost-effective instrument for promoting economic development.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32230,32230,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
"Air Pollution, Wildfire Smoke, and Worker Health","Marika Cabral, Marcus Dillender","Little is known about how pollution impacts worker health and workplace safety. This paper leverages high-frequency, plausibly exogenous variation in wildfire smoke to estimate the impact of pollution on workplace injuries. Our analysis draws on unique data we construct through linking information on smoke plumes and pollution to comprehensive administrative data on workers’ compensation injury claims from Texas. We first document that wildfire smoke increases ambient air pollution—with our estimates indicating that a day of smoke coverage is associated with an average increase in PM₂.₅ of 18.6%. We find that an additional day of smoke coverage leads to a 2.8% increase in workplace injury claims. Similar percent increases in workplace injuries are found across different types of injuries and workers. However, because of large variation in baseline injury risk, the incidence of these pollution-induced injuries is concentrated among workers in high-risk occupations, and supplemental analysis illustrates potential opportunities for improving the targeting of costly mitigation. Our estimates indicate that pollution—and wildfire smoke in particular—substantially harms worker health, even at pollution levels well below current and proposed regulatory standards. Overall, our findings suggest workers face unique risks from pollution and provide insights for policy aiming to address these risks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32232,32232,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
"Health Shocks under Hospital Capacity Constraint: Evidence from Air Pollution in Sao Paulo, Brazil","Bruna Guidetti, Paula Pereda, Edson R. Severnini","How responsive to health shocks are healthcare systems in the developing world? Developing countries are known to have both lower levels of hospital infrastructure and serious health shocks driven by air pollution. These shocks are transitory and may be marginal relative to other health demands, so healthcare systems might be able to manage them. On the other hand, with limited capacity hospitals may not be able to respond rapidly, possibly exacerbating health damages from pollution. In this study, we examine the consequences of health shocks induced by air pollution in a megacity in the developing world: Sao Paulo, Brazil. Using daily data on pediatric hospitalizations from 2015-2017, an instrumental variable approach based on wind speed, and a plausibly exogenous measure of hospital capacity constraints, we show that such transitory health shocks can disrupt healthcare services due to limited capacity, including for conditions seemingly unrelated to air pollution. Also, we cannot rule out severe deterioration of health outcomes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32224,32224,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
The Causal Effect of Parents’ Education on Children’s Earnings,"Sang Yoon (Tim) Lee, Nicolas A. Roys, Ananth Seshadri","We present a model of endogenous schooling and earnings to isolate the causal effect of parents’ education on children’s education and earnings outcomes. The model suggests that parents’ education is positively related to children’s earnings, but its relationship with children’s education is ambiguous. Identification is achieved by comparing the earnings of children with the same length of schooling, whose parents have different lengths of schooling. The model also features heterogeneous preferences for schooling, and is estimated using HRS data. The empirically observed positive OLS coefficient obtained by regressing children’s schooling on parents’ schooling is mainly accounted for by the correlation between parents’ schooling and children’s unobserved preferences for schooling. This is countered by a negative, structural relationship between parents’ and children’s schooling choices, resulting in an IV coefficient close to zero when exogenously increasing parents’ schooling. Nonetheless, an exogenous one-year increase in parents’ schooling increases children’s lifetime earnings by 1.2 percent on average.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32223,32223,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
Losing Medicaid and Crime,"Monica Deza, Thanh Lu, Johanna Catherine Maclean, Alberto Ortega","We study the impact of losing health insurance on criminal activity by leveraging one of the most substantial Medicaid disenrollments in U.S. history, which occurred in Tennessee in 2005 and lead to 190,000 non–elderly and non–disabled adults without dependents unexpectedly losing coverage. Using police agency–level data and a difference–in–differences approach, we find that this mass insurance loss increased total crime rates with particularly strong effects for non–violent crime. We test for several potential mechanisms and find that our results may be explained by economic stability and access to healthcare, in particular mental healthcare.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32227,32227,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
A Housing Portfolio Channel of QE Transmission,"Dominik Boddin, Daniel Marcel te Kaat, Chang Ma, Alessandro Rebucci","We document a housing portfolio channel of quantitative easing (QE) transmission exploiting variation in German household data in a difference-in-differences setting around QE adoption in 2015. We find that QE encourages households with larger initial bond positions to rebalance more toward second homes. Rebalancing is especially pronounced among higher-income and church-affiliated households with stronger tax incentives to purchase and rent out properties. We also show that, in regions more exposed to this channel, house prices increase more than rents, and sale listings decrease more than rental ones, suggesting that the rental supply may increase in response to QE.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32211,32211,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
A Practical Guide to Endogeneity Correction Using Copulas,"Yi Qian, Anthony Koschmann, Hui Xie","Causal inference is of central interests in many empirical applications yet often challenging because of the presence of endogenous regressors. The classical approach to the problem requires using instrumental variables that must satisfy the stringent condition of exclusion restriction. At the forefront of recent research, instrument-free copula methods have been increasingly used to handle endogenous regressors. This article aims to provide a practical guide for how to handle endogeneity using copulas. The authors give an overview of copula endogeneity correction and its usage in marketing research, discuss recent advances that broaden the understanding, applicability, and robustness of copula correction, and examine implementation challenges of copula correction such as construction of copula control functions and handling of higher-order terms of endogenous regressors. To facilitate the appropriate usage of copula correction, the authors detail a process of checking data requirements and identification assumptions to determine when and how to use copula correction methods, and illustrate its usage using empirical examples.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32231,32231,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024

We show that as inflation rose in advanced economies, both households and firms became more attentive and informed about publicly available news about inflation, leading them to respond less to exogenously provided information about inflation and monetary policy. We also study the effects of RCTs in countries where inflation has been consistently high (Uruguay) and low (New Zealand) as well as what happens when the same agents are repeatedly provided information in both low-and high-inflation environments (Italy).

Fallow Lengths and the Structure of Property Rights,"Etienne Le Rossignol, Sara Lowes, Eduardo Montero","We study a fundamental institution in many societies: the structure of property rights over land. Across societies, communal land rights have been more common than private land rights. We test the hypothesis that longer fallow requirements – the time needed to leave land uncultivated to restore fertility – led to a higher prevalence of communal property rights. Longer fallow requirements generate higher protection costs and therefore make communal rights more beneficial. We construct an ecological measure of the optimal fallow length for the most suitable staple crop across grid cells based on soil type, temperature, and climate. We find that places where land needs to be fallowed for longer periods are more likely to have communal property rights both historically and presently. We then examine the implications for efforts to title land. We find that World Bank land titling interventions are less effective in places with longer fallow requirements, suggesting a mismatch between development policy and underlying institutions. Finally, we examine implications for income inequality and conflict. We find that longer fallow requirements are associated with less inequality, less conflict, and greater resilience to negative shocks. Our results highlight the origins of property rights structures and how communal property rights interact with development policies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32226,32226,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
Navigating by Falling Stars: Monetary Policy with Fiscally Driven Natural Rates,"Rodolfo G. Campos, Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Galo Nuño, Peter Paz","We study a new type of monetary-fiscal interaction in a heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian model with a fiscal block. Due to household heterogeneity, the stock of public debt affects the natural interest rate, forcing the central bank to adapt its monetary policy rule to the fiscal stance to guarantee that inflation remains at its target. There is, however, a minimum level of debt below which the steady-state inflation deviates from its target due to the zero lower bound on nominal rates. We analyze the response to a debt-financed fiscal expansion and quantify the impact of different timings in the adaptation of the monetary policy rule, as well as the performance of alternative monetary policy rules that do not require an assessment of the natural rates. We validate our findings with a series of empirical estimates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32219,32219,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
Behavioral Sticky Prices,"Sergio Rebelo, Miguel Santana, Pedro Teles","We study a model where households make decisions according to a dual-process framework widely used in cognitive psychology. System 1 uses effortless heuristics but is susceptible to biases and errors. System 2 uses mental effort to make more accurate decisions. Through their pricing behavior, monopolistic producers can influence whether households deploy Systems 1 or 2. The strategic use of this influence creates a new source of price inertia and provides a natural explanation for the ""rockets and feathers"" phenomenon: prices rise quickly when costs increase but fall slowly when costs fall. Our model implies that price stability is not optimal.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32214,32214,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
Are Supply Networks Efficiently Resilient?,"Agostino Capponi, Chuan Du, Joseph E. Stiglitz","We show that supply networks are inefficiently, and insufficiently, resilient. Upstream firms can expand their production capacity to hedge against supply and demand shocks. But the social benefits of such investments are not internalized due to market power and market incompleteness. Upstream firms under-invest in capacity and resilience, passing-on the costs to down-stream firms, and drive trade excessively towards the spot markets. There is a wedge between the market solution and a constrained optimal benchmark, which persists even without rare and large shocks. Policies designed to incentivize capacity investment, reduce reliance on spot markets, and enhance competition ameliorate the externality.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32221,32221,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
Do People Report Happiness Accurately?,"James Andreoni, B. Douglas Bernheim, Tingyan Jia","Validation of happiness measures is inherently challenging because subjective sensations are unobserved. We introduce a novel validation method: subjects report how happy they would feel (or did feel) after some specified event, as well as how they would respond (or would have responded) to a survey question about their happiness after the same event. The difference between these two responses measures “self-reported misreporting.” We demonstrate that self-reported misreporting varies across events and is substantial for certain types of events. These findings imply that caution is warranted when interpreting differences in self-reported well-being across contexts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32208,32208,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
Equilibrium Responses to Price Controls: A Supply-Chain Approach,Casey B. Mulligan,"Prices are regulated in many markets, ranging from healthcare to labor to telecommunications.  This paper reinterprets the variables in the basic supply-demand model so that both product-definition and quantity are equilibrium outcomes.  Specifically, compliance with price controls is achieved by altering the production-factor mix along the supply chain.  This approach yields surprising insights into the incidence of price regulations and their effects on the amount of trade.  Furthermore, it reveals how many of the short-run effects of price controls can be opposite of what they are in the long run.  The supply-chain framework also easily represents business-to-business price controls, which have been more prevalent in policy practice than price-theoretic analysis.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32216,32216,24-Mar,NBER,3/11/2024
Consumers' payment preferences and banking digitalisation in the euro area,"Justus Meyer, Federica Teppa","This paper contributes to understanding consumers' retail payment preferences and digitalisation in personal finances. We focus on the acceptance of cashless payments in everyday situations and the use of mobile banking apps in the euro area, where the payment services market has changed significantly in recent years. In particular, we study app-based tools for day-to-day (offline) purchases that involve small amounts of money as well as digital tools for managing personal finances. By looking at factors associated with using non-cash payment methods, and app-based financial services solutions, we shed light on the topic of financial inclusion in payment services that concern consumers’ everyday choices. Using granular microdata from the European Central Bank's Consumer Expectations Survey, we find that most people prefer to use only one payment instrument. After the COVID-19 pandemic, it has mostly been cash and contactless cards. The use of cash is partly due to limited perceived acceptance of non-cash payments by merchants. We also find substantial cross-country heterogeneity and highlight the prominent role of demographic factors in choosing non-cash payment options and app-based tools when managing personal finances. While mobile banking is already popular amongst euro area consumers, the use of smart payment methods remains very limited. Our findings suggest that financial service providers should recognize the growing preference of the younger generations for alternative payment methods. Creating awareness among consumers might also lead to positive feedback effects by reducing consumers’ reliance on cash through higher perceived availability of non-cash payment options.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2915~85b11b83ed.en.pdf?da242a36449551e3a0c499fad01ba6a0,2915,12-Mar-24,ECB,3/12/2024
Weathering the Storm: Supply Chains and Climate Risk,"Juanma Castro-Vincenzi, Gaurav Khanna, Nicolas Morales, Nitya Pandalai-Nayar","We characterize how firms structure supply chains under climate risk. Using new data on the universe of firm-to-firm transactions from an Indian state, we show that firms diversify sourcing locations, and suppliers exposed to climate risk charge lower prices. Our event-study analysis finds that firms with suppliers in flood-affected districts experience a decline in inputs lasting two months, followed by a return to original suppliers. We develop a general equilibrium model of firm input sourcing under climate risk. Firms diversify identical inputs from suppliers across space, trading off the probability of a climate shock against higher input costs. We quantify the model using data on 271 Indian districts, showing real wages vary across space and are correlated with geography and productivity. Wages are inversely correlated with sourcing risk, giving rise to a cost minimization-resilience tradeoff. Supply chain diversification unambiguously reduces real wage volatility, but ambiguously affects their levels, as diversification may come with higher input costs. While diversification helps mitigate climate risk, it exacerbates the distributional effects of climate change by reducing wages in regions prone to more frequent shocks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32218,32218,24-Mar,NBER,3/12/2024

This paper aims to place the current debt landscape in a historical context and investigate the drivers of debt surges, to what degree they result in a crisis as well as examine post-surge debt trajectories and under what conditions debt follows a non-declining path. We find that fiscal policy and stock-flow adjustments play important roles in debt dynamics with the valuation effects arising from currency depreciation explaining more than half of stock flow adjustments in LICs.

Monetary Policy with Uncertain Inflation Persistence,"Luis Brandão-Marques, Roland Meeks, Vina Nguyen","When uncertain about inflation persistence, central banks are well-advised to adopt a robust strategy when setting interest rates. This robust approach, characterized by a ""better safe than sorry"" philosophy, entails incurring a modest cost to safeguard against a protracted period of deviating inflation. Applied to the post-pandemic period of exceptional uncertainty and elevated inflation, this strategy would have called for a tightening bias. Specifically, a high level of uncertainty surrounding wage, profit, and price dynamics requires a more front-loaded increase in interest rates compared to a baseline scenario which the policymaker fully understands how shocks to those variables are transmitted to inflation and output. This paper provides empirical evidence of such uncertainty and estimates a New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model for the euro area to derive a robust interest rate path for the ECB which serves to illustrate the case for insuring against inflation turning out to have greater persistence.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/07/Monetary-Policy-with-Uncertain-Inflation-Persistence-545762,WPIEA2024047,"Fri, 08 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/12/2024
Predicting IMF-Supported Programs: A Machine Learning Approach,"Tsendsuren Batsuuri, Shan He, Ruofei Hu, Jonathan Leslie, Flora Lutz","This study applies state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast IMF-supported programs, analyzes the ML prediction results relative to traditional econometric approaches, explores non-linear relationships among predictors indicative of IMF-supported programs, and evaluates model robustness with regard to different feature sets and time periods. ML models consistently outperform traditional methods in out-of-sample prediction of new IMF-supported arrangements with key predictors that align well with the literature and show consensus across different algorithms. The analysis underscores the importance of incorporating a variety of external, fiscal, real, and financial features as well as institutional factors like membership in regional financing arrangements. The findings also highlight the varying influence of data processing choices such as feature selection, sampling techniques, and missing data imputation on the performance of different ML models and therefore indicate the usefulness of a flexible, algorithm-tailored approach. Additionally, the results reveal that models that are most effective in near and medium-term predictions may tend to underperform over the long term, thus illustrating the need for regular updates or more stable – albeit potentially near-term suboptimal – models when frequent updates are impractical.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/09/Predicting-IMF-Supported-Programs-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-545753,WPIEA2024054,"Fri, 08 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/12/2024
"Specialization, Market Access and Real Income","Dominick Bartelme, Ting Lan, Andrei A Levchenko","This paper estimates the impact of external demand shocks on real income. We utilize a first order approximation to a wide class of small open economy models that feature sector-level gravity in trade flows, which allows us to measure foreign shocks and characterize their welfare impact in terms of reducedform elasticities. We use machine learning techniques to group 4-digit manufacturing sectors into a smaller number of clusters, and show that the cluster-level elasticities of income with respect to foreign shocks can be estimated using high-dimensional statistical techniques. Foreign demand shocks in complex intermediate and capital goods have large positive impacts on real income, whereas impacts in other sectors are negligible. We showthat the estimates imply that countries that specialize in these sectors enjoy greater gains from increased openness, and that (small) export subsidies to these sectors are welfare-improving. Finally, a calibrated multisector production and trade model with input-output linkages and external economies of scale can match the empirical estimates.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/08/Specialization-Market-Access-and-Real-Income-545756,WPIEA2024051,"Fri, 08 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/12/2024
Strengthening Income Stabilization through Social Protection in Emerging and Developing Economies: The Brazilian Experience,"Fernanda Brollo, Gabriel Lara Ibarra, Ricardo Campante Vale","Social protection programs are crucial for stabilizing household income, especially during crises. Brazil's response to the pandemic, the Auxilio Emergencial (AE) program, demonstrated the value of a resilient social safety net and digital tools. This study assesses AE's effectiveness in income stabilization, poverty reduction, and inequality. Results show that the pre-pandemic social protection system would have only buffered about a quarter of income loss, with unemployment insurance more significant for higher-income households, and social safety net transfers crucial for lower-income households, especially those in informal employment. AE successfully supported lower-income households during the pandemic, but its generosity went beyond the stabilization of income, resulting in large fiscal costs.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/08/Strengthening-Income-Stabilization-through-Social-Protection-in-Emerging-and-Developing-545498,WPIEA2024052,"Fri, 08 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/12/2024
Understanding Inflation Dynamics: The Role of Global Shocks in CEMAC,"Johanna  Tiedemann, Olivier Bizimana, Lluis Dalmau, Martin Ambassa","As in the rest of the world, inflation in CEMAC surged more quickly and persistently than expected during the 2021–23 period. This paper examines the drivers of inflation dynamics and the contribution of global shocks to inflation persistence in CEMAC. We use a Phillips curve framework combined with the local projections method. Our results confirm the prominent role of global factors in driving inflation dynamics. Global commodity food and oil price fluctuations, and shipping costs are the main factors explaining the large variability in headline inflation. Further, we find that global price shocks have sizable and persistent effects on domestic headline inflation, with differences in the magnitude and speed of pass-through. The pass-through from commodity food price fluctuations to headline inflation is higher and more persistent than that of other global price shocks, reflecting the large share of food in the consumption baskets, which makes inflation more vulnerable to direct effects of international food shocks, but also larger second-round effects.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/09/Understanding-Inflation-Dynamics-The-Role-of-Global-Shocks-in-CEMAC-545771,WPIEA2024055,"Fri, 08 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/12/2024

Fallow Lengths and the Structure of Property Rights,"Etienne Le Rossignol, Sara Lowes, Eduardo Montero","We study a fundamental institution in many societies: the structure of property rights over land. Across societies, communal land rights have been more common than private land rights. We test the hypothesis that longer fallow requirements – the time needed to leave land uncultivated to restore fertility – led to a higher prevalence of communal property rights. Longer fallow requirements generate higher protection costs and therefore make communal rights more beneficial. We construct an ecological measure of the optimal fallow length for the most suitable staple crop across grid cells based on soil type, temperature, and climate. We find that places where land needs to be fallowed for longer periods are more likely to have communal property rights both historically and presently. We then examine the implications for efforts to title land. We find that World Bank land titling interventions are less effective in places with longer fallow requirements, suggesting a mismatch between development policy and underlying institutions. Finally, we examine implications for income inequality and conflict. We find that longer fallow requirements are associated with less inequality, less conflict, and greater resilience to negative shocks.

Greening the economy: how public-guaranteed loans influence firm-level resource allocation,"Ixart Miquel-Flores, Alessio Reghezza, Bruno Buchetti, Salvatore Perdichizzi","This study investigates the underlying reasons for banks’ continued support of fossil fuel-based firms and examines the role of public guaranteed loans (PGLs) in redirecting resources towards greener economic activities, thereby facilitating the climate transition process. Using a unique pan-European credit register dataset, we combine supervisory bank data with firm-level greenhouse gas emission data and financial information. Our analysis yields three main findings. Firstly, European banks perceive lending to green companies as riskier compared to their brown counterparts, a phenomenon we term as the “green-transition risk.” Secondly, we provide evidence that during the COVID-19 pandemic, European banks have strategically leveraged PGLs to channel resources towards environmentally sustainable activities, thereby augmenting the proportion of green loans in their portfolios and partially shifting the inherent “green-transition risk” to European governments and citizens. Lastly, our investigation reveals a banking preference for awarding PGLs to financially robust green firms over less profitable, highly indebted green firms, which could pose significant challenges for green businesses requiring financial support during the COVID-19 crisis.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2916~f95e083a6e.en.pdf?7e7b84596b4aa298901c6b2251bab191,2916,13-Mar-24,ECB,3/13/2024
On Recoding Ordered Treatments as Binary Indicators,"Evan K.

We investigate this estimand under the assumption that the instruments shift compliers from no treatment to some but not from some treatment to more. We show that when there are extensive margin compliers only (EMCO) this estimand captures a weighted average of treatment effects that can be partially unbundled into each complier group’s potential outcome means.

Spare tyres with a hole: investment funds under stress and credit to firms,"Giulio Nicoletti, Judit Rariga, Costanza Rodriguez d’Acri","We study the impact of a liquidity shock affecting investment funds on the financing conditions of firms. The abrupt liquidity needs of investment funds, triggered by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, prompted a retrenchment from bond purchases of firms and a withdrawal of short term funds from banks, impacting firm financing costs directly via bond markets, and indirectly via banks. According to our results, the spreads of corporate bonds held by investment funds increased. Furthermore, an increase in the short term funding exposure of a bank to investment funds triggered a contraction in new loans to euro area firms. Overall, our results show that while non-banks in general support firm financing by acting as a spare tyre when banks do not, their own stress can trigger a contractionary credit supply effect for firms.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2917~448d567a5f.en.pdf?66f5fc63902b94ca5ab8a7d3e0e6c6fc,2917,14-Mar-24,ECB,3/14/2024

Banks in Space,"Ezra Oberfield, Esteban Rossi-Hansberg, Nicholas Trachter, Derek Wenning","We study the spatial expansion of banks in response to banking deregulation in the 1980s and 90s. During this period, large banks expanded rapidly, mostly by adding new branches in new locations, while many small banks exited. We document that large banks sorted into the densest markets, but that sorting weakened over time as large banks expanded to more marginal markets in search of locations with a relative abundance of retail deposits. This allowed large banks to reduce their dependence on expensive wholesale funding and grow further. To rationalize these patterns we propose a theory of multi-branch banks that sort into heterogeneous locations. Our theory yields two forms of sorting. First, span-of-control sorting incentivizes top firms to select the largest markets and smaller banks the more marginal ones. Second, mismatch sorting incentivizes banks to locate in more marginal locations, where deposits are abundant relative to loan demand, to better align their deposits and loans and minimize wholesale funding. Together, these two forms of sorting account well for the sorting patterns we document in the data.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/banks-in-space/,2024-32-1,13-Mar-24,BFI,3/15/2024
The impact of prudential regulations on the UK housing market and economy: insights from an agent-based model,"Marco Bardoscia, Adrian Carro, Marc Hinterschweiger, Mauro Napoletano, Lilit Popoyan, Andrea Roventini and Arzu Uluc","We develop a macroeconomic agent-based model to study the joint impact of borrower and lender-based prudential policies on the housing and credit markets and the economy more widely. We perform three experiments: (i) an increase of total capital requirements; (ii) an introduction of a loan-to-income (LTI) cap on mortgages to owner-occupiers; and (iii) a joint introduction of both experiments at the same time. Our results suggest that tightening capital requirements leads to a sharp decrease in commercial and mortgage lending, and housing transactions. When the LTI cap is in place, house prices fall sharply relative to income, and the homeownership rate decreases. When both policy instruments are combined, we find that housing transactions and prices drop.

Can Fiscal Consolidation Announcements Help Anchor Inflation Expectations?,"Antonio David, Samuel Pienknagura, Juan Yepez","In this paper, we use quarterly data and a novel database on fiscal policy consolidation announcements, for a sample of advanced economies and emerging markets to quantify the effects of fiscal tightening on inflation expectations. We find that fiscal consolidation announcements reduce inflation expectations over the medium-term (three and five-years ahead), but not in the short-term (one-year ahead). There is also some evidence that consolidation announcements reduce “disagreement” about expected future inflation at longer horizons. The inflation anchoring role of consolidation announcements is enhanced by the strength of a country’s fiscal and monetary frameworks, and when fiscal and monetary policy work in tandem. In addition, we find that initial conditions matter—inflation expectation’s response to consolidation announcements is larger in periods of high contemporaneous inflation. With these results in hand, we show that the effectiveness of fiscal consolidation in controlling realized inflation depends greatly on the response of inflation expectations to consolidation announcements. These results show that fiscal policy is crucial to anchor inflation expectations and a key element of a credible disinflationary process.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/15/Can-Fiscal-Consolidation-Announcements-Help-Anchor-Inflation-Expectations-545122,WPIEA2024060,"Fri, 15 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/16/2024

Effect of Exchange Rate Movements on Inflation in Sub-Saharan Africa,Laurent Kemoe,"This paper provides new evidence on the exchange rate passthrough to domestic inflation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) using both bilateral US dollar exchange rate and the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), and monthly data. We find that depreciations cause sizable increases in domestic inflation. The passthrough in SSA is higher than in other regions and its magnitude depends on the exchange rate regime, type of exchange rate (bilateral versus NEER), natural resource endowment and domestic market competitiveness. The passthrough is found to be disproportionately larger and more persistent for large depreciation shocks, and for exchange rate changes that are more persistent. We also find evidence of asymmetry, with passthrough eight times stronger during depreciations than appreciations. Additional findings suggest that improved monetary policy effectiveness is an important driver of our observed declining estimates of exchange rate passthrough over time, supporting the long-standing view that strengthening monetary policy frameworks and credibility helps mitigate the impact of depreciations on inflation.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/15/Effect-of-Exchange-Rate-Movements-on-Inflation-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa-545750,WPIEA2024059,"Fri, 15 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/16/2024

The ECB’s Future Monetary Policy Operational Framework: Corridor or Floor?,"Luis Brandão-Marques, Lev Ratnovski","This paper reviews the trade-offs involved in the choice of the ECB’s monetary policy operational framework. As long as the ECB’s supply of reserves remains well in excess of the banks’ demand, the ECB will likely continue to employ a floor system for implementing the target interest rate in money markets. Once the supply of reserves declines and approaches the steep part of the reserves demand function, the ECB will face a choice between a corridor system and some variant of a floor system. There are distinct pros and cons associated with each option. A corridor would be consistent with a smaller ECB balance sheet size, encourage banks to manage their liquidity buffers more tightly, and facilitate greater activity in the interbank market. But it would require relatively more frequent market operations to ensure the money markets rate stays close to the policy rate and could leave the banking system vulnerable to intermittent liquidity shortages that may have financial stability implications and impair monetary transmission. The floor, on the other hand, would allow for more precise control of the overnight rate and a lower risk of liquidity shortages, but it would entail a somewhat larger ECB balance sheet, weaken the incentives for banks to manage their liquidity buffers, and discourage interbank market activity. The analysis of tradeoffs suggests that, on balance, in steady state, a hybrid system that combines the features of the “parsimonious floor” (with a minimal volume of reserves) with a lending facility or frequent short-term full-allotment lending operations priced at or very close to the deposit rate, making it a “zero (or near-zero) corridor”, would be most conducive for achieving the ECB’s monetary policy objective.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/15/The-ECBs-Future-Monetary-Policy-Operational-Framework-Corridor-or-Floor-546355,WPIEA2024056,"Fri, 15 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/16/2024
On the Spatial Determinants of Educational Access,"Francesco Agostinelli, Margaux Luflade, Paolo Martellini","We define educational access as the component of a neighborhood's value that is determined by the set of schools available to its residents. This paper studies the extent to which educational access is determined by sorting based on heterogeneous preferences over school attributes, or local institutions that constrain residential location and school choice---such as school catchment areas and housing regulation. We develop a spatial equilibrium model of residential sorting and school choice, estimated using data from a large school district in the United States. The model replicates the responses of house prices and school enrollment to quasi-experimental variation in school peer composition and school transportation provision. We find that low-income families prioritize proximity to schools while high-income families and families with high-skilled children place more value on school peer composition. We use the model to evaluate how the geography of neighborhood sorting influences the aggregate and distributional outcomes of a school-choice expansion (place-based) and a housing voucher (people-based) policy. We find that both policies result in net welfare losses, with only marginal improvements in school peer composition for the average low-income family. Although eligible families benefit from these policies, the negative impact falls on families who currently invest in their children's education by residing in expensive neighborhoods. Under both policies, higher-income families are less exposed to the inflow of low-income children into their schools, either because of their longer distance from target neighborhoods or because of the cost imposed by residential zoning regulation on voucher recipients.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32246,32246,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024

Adaptation Using Financial Markets: Climate Risk Diversification through Securitization,"Matthew E. Kahn, Amine Ouazad, Erkan Yönder","In the face of rising climate risk, financial institutions may adapt by transferring such risk to securitizers that have the skill and expertise to build diversified pools, such as Mortgage-Backed Securities. In diversified pools, exposure to climate risk may be a drop in the ocean of cash flows. This paper builds a data set of the entire securitization chain from mortgage-level to MBS deal-level cash flows, and observes the prices of the tranches at monthly frequency. Wildfires lead to higher rates of prepayment and foreclosure at the mortgage level, and larger losses during foreclosure sales. At the MBS deal level, a lower spatial concentration of dollar balances (lower spatial dollar Herfindahl), a lower spatial correlation in wildfire events (within-deal correlation), leads to a lower exposure to wildfire events. These quantifiable metrics of diversification identify those existing deals whose design makes them resilient to climate change. This paper builds optimal deals by finding the portfolio weights in an asset demand system that targets return and risk. Extrapolating wildfire risk using a granular wildfire probability model and temperature projections in 2050, we build climate resilient MBSs whose returns are minimally impacted by wildfire risk even as they supply mortgage credit to wildfire prone areas. Finally, we test whether the market prices the sensitivity of each deal’s cash flow to wildfire risk.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32244,32244,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024
Central Banking Post Crises,"Michael Kiley, Frederic S. Mishkin","The world economy has experienced the largest financial crisis in generations, a global pandemic, and a resurgence in inflation during the first quarter of the 21st century, yielding important insights for central banking. Price stability has important benefits and is the responsibility of a central bank. Achieving price stability in a complex and uncertain environment involves a credible commitment to a nominal anchor with a strong response to inflation and pre-emptive leaning against an overheating economy. Associated challenges imply that central bank communication and transparency are key elements of monetary policy strategies and tactics. Crises have emphasized the role of central banks in promoting financial stability, as financial stability is key to achieving price and economic stability, but this role increases risks to independence. Goals for central banks other than price and economic stability, complemented by financial stability, can make it more difficult for them to stabilize both inflation and economic activity.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32237,32237,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024

While both channels amplify the size of spillovers/spillbacks, only precautionary savings can change their sign relative to RANK.

"Regulation of Access, Pricing, and Planning of High Voltage Transmission in the U.S.","Joe DeLosa III, Johannes P. Pfeifenberger, Paul Joskow","The U.S. regulation of high-voltage transmission is highly complex and, as a result, generally poorly understood. The complexity is created by separate, but overlapping, jurisdictional authorities of the U.S. federal regulators and those of individual states, districts, and territories. While U.S. federal regulators have authority over stand-alone transmission service and the regional wholesale power markets that use the transmission grid, state regulators have jurisdiction over both (1) retail electricity services that include the distribution network, the retail cost of transmission service, and often generation service; and (2) the permitting of most new transmission facilities within their states’ boundaries. Some of these federal and state regulatory authorities overlap and some of them do not apply to non-jurisdictional transmission providers (such as certain municipal utilities, cooperatives, and federal power marketing agencies) and states (such as Texas) that are not synchronized with the larger regional grid. We summarize this complex structure of transmission regulation in the U.S. and the history of regulations that have created the industry structure and regulatory frameworks that exist today. We provide an overview of how transmission investments are priced and recovered and the planning processes that individual transmission owners and regional grid operators use to plan the necessary expansion of the high-voltage transmission grid. We also point out some of the economic inefficiencies that are created by a combination of balkanized regulatory structures and outdated industry planning practices.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32254,32254,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024
Non-robustness of Diffusion Estimates on Networks with Measurement Error,"Arun G. Chandrasekhar, Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, Tyler McCormick, Samuel A. Thau, Jerry Wei","Network diffusion models are used to study things like disease transmission, information spread, and technology adoption. However, small amounts of mismeasurement are extremely likely in the networks constructed to operationalize these models. We show that estimates of diffusions are highly non-robust to this measurement error. First, we show that even when measurement error is vanishingly small, such that the share of missed links is close to zero, forecasts about the extent of diffusion will greatly underestimate the truth. Second, a small mismeasurement in the identity of the initial seed generates a large shift in the locations of expected diffusion path. We show that both of these results still hold when the vanishing measurement error is only local in nature. Such non-robustness in forecasting exists even under conditions where the basic reproductive number is consistently estimable. Possible solutions, such as estimating the measurement error or implementing widespread detection efforts, still face difficulties because the number of missed links are so small. Finally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations on simulated networks, and real networks from three settings: travel data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the western US, a mobile phone marketing campaign in rural India, and in an insurance experiment in China.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32251,32251,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024
Sticky Discount Rates,"Masao Fukui, Niels Joachim Gormsen, Kilian Huber","We show that firms' nominal required returns to capital (i.e., their discount rates) are sticky with respect to expected inflation. Such nominally sticky discount rates imply that increases in expected inflation directly lower firms' real discount rates and thereby raise real investment. We analyze the macroeconomic implications of sticky discount rates using a New Keynesian model. The model naturally generates investment-consumption comovement in response to household demand shocks and higher investment in response to government spending. Sticky discount rates imply that inflation has real effects, even absent other nominal rigidities, making them a distinct source of monetary non-neutrality. At the same time, sticky discount rates make the short-term interest rate less effective at stimulating investment. Optimal monetary policy focuses on inflation expectations and permanently lowers the long-run inflation target in response to expansionary shocks, even when shocks are temporary.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32238,32238,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024

Second, this pay-productivity relationship strengthens with seniority, doubling from an elasticity of 0.07 for pay on productivity for the median-paid employee to 0.15 for the top-paid employee. Consequently, more productive firms have higher within-firm inequality. Our data suggests this is driven by their greater adoption of aggressive performance-pay bonus and management schemes.

Scenarios for the Transition to AGI,"Anton Korinek, Donghyun Suh","We analyze how output and wages behave under different scenarios for technological progress that may culminate in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), defined as the ability of AI systems to perform all tasks that humans can perform. We assume that human work can be decomposed into atomistic tasks that differ in their complexity. Advances in technology make ever more complex tasks amenable to automation. The effects on wages depend on a race between automation and capital accumulation. If automation proceeds sufficiently slowly, then there is always enough work for humans, and wages may rise forever. By contrast, if the complexity of tasks that humans can perform is bounded and full automation is reached, then wages collapse. But declines may occur even before if large-scale automation outpaces capital accumulation and makes labor too abundant. Automating productivity growth may lead to broad-based gains in the returns to all factors. By contrast, bottlenecks to growth from irreproducible scarce factors may exacerbate the decline in wages.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32255,32255,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024
Evaluating and Pricing Health Insurance in Lower-income Countries: A Field Experiment in India,"Anup Malani, Cynthia Kinnan, Gabriella Conti, Kosuke Imai, Morgen Miller, Shailender Swaminathan, Alessandra Voena, Bartosz Woda","Universal health coverage is a widely shared goal across lower-income countries. We conducted a large-scale, 4-year trial that randomized premiums and subsidies for India’s first national, public hospital insurance program, RSBY. We find roughly 60% uptake even when consumers were charged premiums equal to the government’s cost for insurance. We also find substantial adverse selection into insurance at positive prices. Insurance enrollment increases insurance utilization, partly due to spillovers from use of insurance by neighbors. However, many enrollees attempted to use insurance but failed, suggesting that learning is critical to the success of public insurance. We find very few statistically significant impacts of insurance access or enrollment on health. Because there is substantial willingness-to-pay for insurance, and given how distortionary it is to raise revenue in the Indian context, we calculate that our sample population should be charged a premium for RSBY between INR 500-1000 rather than a zero premium to maximize the marginal value of public funds.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32239,32239,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024
The Effect of Early Childhood Programs on Third-Grade Test Scores: Evidence from Transitional Kindergarten in Michigan,"Jordan S. Berne, Brian A.

We provide the first estimates of the impact of Michigan’s TK program on 3rd grade test scores. Using an augmented regression discontinuity design, we find that TK improves 3rd grade test scores by 0.29 (math) and 0.19 (English Language Arts) standard deviations relative to a counterfactual that includes other formal and informal early learning options.

The Effect of Price Caps on Pharmaceutical Advertising: Evidence from the 340b Drug Pricing Program,"Sylvia Hristakeva, Julie Holland Mortimer, Eric Yde","We study the effect of price caps on the provision of costly effort by pharmaceutical firms using variation in drug discounts generated by a price regulation program that allows eligible hospitals to purchase outpatient drugs at steep discounts. These discounts directly affect drug manufacturers’ markups, and may change firms’ incentives to exert promotional effort targeted towards physicians at these hospitals. We find that the effects of price regulation on pharmaceutical firm effort depend crucially on the design of the regulations. Using detailed data on marketing payments from pharmaceutical firms to physicians, we observe that physicians receive 12% fewer promotional payments after their hospitals take up the program. The design of the price caps imply that discounts tend to increase with a drug’s age. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that pharmaceutical firms shift promotional payments away from older drugs and towards newer drugs, which are less affected by the price caps.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32249,32249,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024
"Technological Synergies, Heterogeneous Firms, and Idiosyncratic Volatility","Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Yang Yu, Francesco Zanetti","This paper shows the importance of technological synergies among heterogeneous firms for aggregate fluctuations. First, we document six novel empirical facts using microdata that suggest the existence of important technological synergies between trading firms, the presence of positive assortative matching among firms, and their evolution during the business cycle. Next, we embed technological synergies in a general equilibrium model calibrated on firm-level data. We show that frictions in forming trading relationships and separation costs explain imperfect sorting between firms in equilibrium. In particular, an increase in the volatility of idiosyncratic productivity shocks significantly decreases aggregate output without resorting to non-convex adjustment costs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32247,32247,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024

Asset Demand and Real Interest Rates,"Paul Beaudry, Katya Kartashova, Césaire Meh","Understanding factors that drive asset demand is central to explaining movements in long-term real interest rates.  In this paper, we begin by documenting that much of the increase in the demand for assets in the US in the 30 years prior to Covid represented greater desire to hold assets by households of given age and income levels. For example, if we focus on the 55-64 age group, its wealth-to-income ratio increased by 45-55%, depending on whether housing is included or not. We then develop a model of asset demands which combines retirement motives and inter-temporal substitution motives to quantitatively explore different factors that may have contributed to such an increase. Our findings suggest that decreasing interest rates likely led to a substantial increase in demand for retirement wealth. We also explore some of the across group heterogeneity and show how social security may explain why the lowest income groups did not follow the general trend. Finally, we discuss macroeconomic implications of long-run asset demands that are a decreasing function of interest rates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32248,32248,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024
Size Matters: Matching Externalities and the Advantages of Large Labor Markets,"Enrico Moretti, Moises Yi","Economists have long hypothesized that large and thick labor markets facilitate the matching between workers and firms. We use administrative data from the LEHD to compare the job search outcomes of workers originally in large and small markets who lost their jobs due to a firm closure. We define a labor market as the Commuting Zone×industry pair in the quarter before the closure. To account for the possible sorting of high-quality workers into larger markets, the effect of market size is identified by comparing workers in large and small markets within the same CZ, conditional on workers fixed effects. In the six quarters before their firm’s closure, workers in small and large markets have a similar probability of employment and quarterly earnings. Following the closure, workers in larger markets experience significantly shorter non-employment spells and smaller earning losses than workers in smaller markets, indicating that larger markets partially insure workers against idiosyncratic employment shocks. A 1 percent increase in market size results in a 0.014 and 0.023 percentage points increase in the 1-year re-employment probability of high school and college graduates, respectively. Displaced workers in larger markets also experience a significantly lower need for relocation to a different CZ. Conditional on finding a new job, the quality of the new worker-firm match is higher in larger markets, as proxied by a higher probability that the new match lasts more than one year; the new industry is the same as the old one; and the new industry is a “good fit” for the worker’s college major.  Consistent with the notion that market size should be particularly consequential for more specialized workers, we find that the effects are larger in industries where human capital is more specialized and less portable. Our findings may help explain the geographical agglomeration of industries—especially those that make intensive use of highly specialized workers—and validate one of the mechanisms that urban economists have proposed for the existence of agglomeration economies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32250,32250,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024
The Impact of Municipal Broadband Restrictions on COVID-19 Labor Market Outcomes,"Saket S. Hegde, Jessica Van Parys","The COVID-19 pandemic initiated a trend in “work-from-home (WFH),” but workers need reliable and fast internet connections (e.g., broadband) to work from home. Yet, as of January 2020, 18 states had legally restricted local governments and cooperatives from building their own broadband infrastructure and/or providing broadband internet to their communities. Such policies reduced broadband access and competition in states with restrictions compared to states without restrictions leading up to the pandemic (Whitacre and Gallardo 2020). We use CPS data from 2018-2023 to estimate a dynamic difference-in-differences model that shows how labor force participation (LFP) rates changed in states with and without broadband restrictions, before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We focus on married women with children, a population with more elastic labor supply that may especially value the flexibility that WFH offers (Dettling 2017). We find that married mothers’ LFP and employment decreased by 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively, in states with restrictions after the pandemic compared to states without restrictions. Labor force outcomes for women without children and married men with children were unaffected by broadband restrictions. The results suggest that married women with children were less able to remain in the workforce in states where their ability to WFH was limited by broadband restrictions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32257,32257,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024
Banks in Space,"Ezra Oberfield, Esteban Rossi-Hansberg, Nicholas Trachter, Derek T. Wenning","We study the spatial expansion of banks in response to banking deregulation in the 1980s and 90s. During this period, large banks expanded rapidly, mostly by adding new branches in new locations, while many small banks exited. We document that large banks sorted into the densest markets, but that sorting weakened over time as large banks expanded to more marginal markets in search of locations with a relative abundance of retail deposits. This allowed large banks to reduce their dependence on expensive wholesale funding and grow further. To rationalize these patterns we propose a theory of multi-branch banks that sort into heterogeneous locations. Our theory yields two forms of sorting. First, span-of-control sorting incentivizes top firms to select the largest markets and smaller banks the more marginal ones. Second, mismatch sorting incentivizes banks to locate in more marginal locations, where deposits are abundant relative to loan demand, to better align their deposits and loans and minimize wholesale funding. Together, these two forms of sorting account well for the sorting patterns we document in the data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32256,32256,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024
Can VAT Cuts and Anti-Profiteering Measures Dampen the Effects of Food Price Inflation?,"Youssef Benzarti, Santiago Garriga, Darío Tortarolo","This paper estimates the effect of a temporary and large (21 p.p.) value-added tax (VAT) cut along with anti-profiteering measures on food necessities during a period of high inflation in Argentina. Using barcode-level data across more than 3,000 supermarkets, we find that (1) absent the anti-profiteering measures, the pass-through of the temporary VAT cut to prices was asymmetric: prices responded less to the VAT cut than its repeal resulting in prices that were higher than their pre-VAT cut levels; (2) imposing anti-profiteering measures, such as setting a ceiling on price increases, led to symmetric pass-through rates. Using a household welfare model, we show that the VAT cut resulted in progressive welfare effects and that the anti-profiteering measures were successful at dampening the regressive welfare effects of the asymmetric pass-through. However, we show that these policies benefited high-income households more because pass-through rates are more asymmetric in independent grocery stores, which is precisely where low-income households tend to shop the most.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32241,32241,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024
Tunneling and Hidden Profits in Health Care,"Ashvin Gandhi, Andrew Olenski","This study examines “tunneling” practices through which health care providers covertly extract profit by making inflated payments for goods and services to commonly-owned related parties. While incentives to tunnel exist across sectors, health care providers may find it uniquely advantageous to do so. Masking profits as costs, thereby obscuring true profitability, may dissuade regulators from imposing stricter quality standards and encourage public payers to increase reimbursement rates. Likewise, tunneling effectively “shields” assets from malpractice liability risk, by moving them off the firm’s balance sheet. Using uniquely detailed financial data on the nursing home industry, we apply a difference-in-differences approach to study how firms’ stated costs change when they start transacting with a related party, allowing us to infer by how much these payments are inflated. We find evidence of widespread tunneling through inflated rents and management fees paid to related parties. Extrapolating these markups to all firms’ related party transactions, our estimates suggest that in 2019, 63% of nursing home profits were hidden and tunneled to related parties through inflated transfer prices.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32258,32258,24-Mar,NBER,3/18/2024

Determinants of currency choice in cross-border bank loans,"Lorenz Emter, Peter McQuade, Swapan-Kumar Pradhan, Martin Schmitz","This paper provides insights into the determinants of currency choice in cross-border bank lending, such as bilateral distance, financial and trade linkages to issuer countries of major currencies, and invoicing currency patterns. Cross-border bank lending in US dollars, and particularly in euro, is highly concentrated in a small number of countries. The UK is central in the international network of loans denominated in euro, although there are tentative signs that this role has diminished for lending to non-banks since Brexit. Offshore financial centres are pivotal for US dollars loans, reflecting, in particular, lending to non-bank financial intermediaries in the Cayman Islands, possibly as a result of regulatory and tax optimisation strategies. The empirical analysis suggests that euro-denominated loans face the “tyranny of distance”, in line with predictions of gravity models of trade, in contrast to US dollar loans. Complementarities between trade invoicing and bank lending are found for both the euro and the US dollar.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2918~6602d9ff72.en.pdf?8d692b386b8d3ffbb35a3aae30b03d5a,2918,18-Mar-24,ECB,3/19/2024

"Financial Literacy, Risk Tolerance, and Cryptocurrency Ownership in the United States",Fumiko Hayashi and Aditi Routh,"Cryptocurrency owners without sufficient financial literacy and risk tolerance may be financially vulnerable, as the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and lacks consumer protections. Our study divides cryptocurrency owners into three groups based on their purpose for holding cryptocurrencies—for investment only (investors), for transactions only (transactors), and for a mix of investment and transactions (mix users)—and examines how each group correlates with financial literacy and risk tolerance compared to consumers who do not own cryptocurrencies (nonowners). Using the 2022 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, we find that investors and mix users are significantly or moderately more financially literate and risk tolerant than nonowners, but transactors are less financially literate and slightly more risk tolerant than nonowners. We also find that the three groups of cryptocurrency owners vary by demographic and financial characteristics.

An Equilibrium Model of Rollover Lotteries,"Giovanni Compiani, Lorenzo Magnolfi, Lones Smith","In a rollover lottery, buyers pick their own numbers, and a jackpot not won adds to the next draw. We develop an equilibrium model of this lottery, since it is a major source of government revenue. Buyers differ in their lottery enjoyment levels, and the market-clearing price is the expected monetary loss on a lottery ticket — namely, ticket face value less expected winnings. The supply curve captures the relation between tickets sold and expected loss implied by the rules of the game. We use this equilibrium model in two empirical applications. First, we test the model’s predictions on the optimal relationship between odds and population size using data from many countries, and across U.S. states. Second, we propose a structural empirical implementation of the model and nonpara-metrically estimate demand for U.S. national rollover lotteries by exploiting the randomness inherent in the rollover mechanism. We find that the model predicts well out of sample and show how to use it to inform lottery design.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/an-equilibrium-model-of-rollover-lotteries/,2024-34,19-Mar-24,BFI,3/21/2024
Sticky Discount Rates,"Masao Fukui, Niels Gormsen, Kilian Huber","We show that firms’ nominal required returns to capital (i.e., their discount rates) are sticky with respect to expected inflation. Such nominally sticky discount rates imply that increases in expected inflation directly lower firms’ real discount rates and thereby raise real investment. We analyze the macroeconomic implications of sticky discount rates using a New Keynesian model. The model naturally generates investment-consumption comovement in response to household demand shocks and higher investment in response to government spending. Sticky discount rates imply that inflation has real effects, even absent other nominal rigidities, making them a distinct source of monetary non-neutrality. At the same time, sticky discount rates make the short-term interest rate less effective at stimulating investment. Optimal monetary policy focuses on inflation expectations and permanently lowers the long-run inflation target in response to expansionary shocks, even when shocks are temporary.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/sticky-discount-rates/,2024-33,18-Mar-24,BFI,3/21/2024
The impact of regulatory changes on rating behaviour,"Nodirbek Karimov, Alper Kara, Gareth Downing, David Marqués-Ibáñez","We examine rating behaviour after the introduction of new regulations regarding Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in the European securitisation market. Employing a large sample of 12,469 ABS tranches issued between 1998 and 2018, we examine the information content of yield spreads of ABS at the issuance and compare the pre- and post-GFC periods. We find that the regulatory changes have been effective in tackling conflicts of interest between issuers and CRAs in securitisation. Rating catering seems to have disappeared in the post-GFC period.

US monetary policy is more powerful in low economic growth regimes,"Roberto A. De Santis, Tommaso Tornese","We use nonlinear empirical methods to uncover non-linearities in the propagation of monetary policy shocks. We find that the transmission on output, goods prices and asset prices is stronger in a low growth regime, contrary to the findings of Tenreyro and Thwaites (2016). The impact is stronger on private investment and durables and milder on the consumption of nondurable goods and services. In periods of low growth, a contractionary monetary policy implies lower expected Treasury rates and higher premia along the entire Treasury yield curve. Similarly, the corporate excess bond premium rises and the stock market drops substantially during recessions. We use the monetary policy surprises and their predictors provided by Bauer and Swanson (2023a), and identify an additional predictor, the National Financial Condition Index (NFCI), which is relevant in the nonlinear setting.

Parental Employment at the Onset of the Pandemic: Effects of Lockdowns and Government Policies,"Kabir Dasgupta, Linda Kirkpatrick, and Alexander Plum","The COVID-19 pandemic had disproportionate impacts on women’s employment, especially for mothers with school-age and younger children. However, the impacts likely varied depending on the type of policy response adopted by various governments. New Zealand presents a unique policy setting in which one of the strictest lockdown restrictions was combined with a generous wage subsidy scheme to secure employment. We utilize tax records to compare employment patterns of parents from the pandemic period (treatment group) to similar parents from a recent pre-pandemic period (control group). For mothers whose youngest child is aged between one and 12, we find a 1-2-percentage point decline in the likelihood of being employed in the first six months of the pandemic; for fathers, we hardly see any significant changes in employment. Additionally, the decline in mothers’ employment rates is mainly driven by those not employed in the month before the lockdown. We also find similar employment patterns for future parents who had no children during the evaluation period. This indicates that the adverse labour market impacts are not uniquely experienced by mothers, but by women in general.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/parental-employment-at-the-onset-of-the-pandemic.htm,2024-012,24-Mar,FED-BOARD,3/23/2024

We devise a simple procedure to estimate the model parameters and the distribution of technologies across sectors, which we apply to Indian data.

Cross-Border Impacts of Climate Policy Packages in North America,"Jean-Marc Fournier, Tannous Kass-Hanna, Liam Masterson, Anne-Charlotte Paret, Sneha D Thube","We quantify cross-border effects of the recent climate mitigation policies introduced in Canada and the U.S., using the global general equilibrium model IMF-ENV. Notably, with the substantial emission reductions from Canada’s carbon tax-led mitigation policies and the U.S.’ Inflation Reduction Act, these two countries would bridge two-thirds of the gap toward their Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) goals. While the broadly divergent policies are believed to elicit competitiveness concerns, we find the aggregate cross-border effects within North America to be very limited and restricted to the energy intensive and trade exposed industries. Potential carbon leakages are also found to be negligible. A more meaningful difference triggered by policy heterogeneity is rather domestic, especially with U.S. subsidies increasing energy output while the Canada model with a carbon tax would marginally decrease it. This analysis is complemented by a stylized model illustrating how such divergence can affect the terms of trade, but also how these effects can be countered by exchange rate flexibility, border adjustments or domestic taxation.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/22/Cross-Border-Impacts-of-Climate-Policy-Packages-in-North-America-546657,WPIEA2024068,"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/23/2024
Deciphering the GloBE in a Low-Tax Jurisdiction,"Shafik Hebous, Cory Hillier, Andualem Mengistu","Pillar Two rules of the Inclusive Framework agreement on a minimum corporate tax (known as ‘Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules’, for short GloBE) have important implications for the design of the corporate income tax. This chapter discusses these implications particularly from the perspective of low-tax jurisdictions. It argues that it is not possible to design a system that always guarantees generating exactly the bare minimum tax intended by the rules and motivates that this should not be the policy objective anyway. Importantly, if no profit tax already exists, countries need to consider whether to adopt one, and if yes, in what form. There is a case for introducing a general profit tax beyond the GloBE rules, together with a qualifying GloBE domestic minimum top-up tax as a backstop. The familiar alternatives of efficient economic rent tax designs, however, are no longer equivalent under the GloBE. In practice, given the specifics of the rules, an efficient rent tax on in-scope multinationals cannot be combined with a statutory tax rate below a certain cutoff, because the minimum tax becomes always binding. Under the GloBE, immediate expensing particularly maintains the time-value of fully deducting the cost of investment, without impacting the GloBE effective tax rate.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/22/Deciphering-the-GloBE-in-a-Low-Tax-Jurisdiction-546343,WPIEA2024064,"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/23/2024
Global Value Chain and Inflation Dynamics,"Vu Chau, Marina Conesa Martinez, Taehoon Kim, John A Spray","We study the inflationary impacts of pandemic lockdown shocks and fiscal and monetary stimulus during 2020-2022 using a novel harmonized dataset of sectoral producer price inflation and input-output linkages for more than 1000 sectors in 53 countries. The inflationary impact of shocks is identified via a Bartik shift-share design, where shares reflect the heterogeneous sectoral exposure to shocks and are derived from a macroeconomic model of international production network. We find that pandemic lockdowns, and subsequent reopening policies, were the most dominant driver of global inflation in this period, especially through their impact on aggregate demand. We provide a decomposition of lockdown shock by sources, and find that between 20-30 percent of the demand effect of lockdown/reopening is due to spillover from abroad. Finally, while fiscal and monetary policies played an important role in preventing deflation in 2020, their effects diminished in the recovery years.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/22/Global-Value-Chain-and-Inflation-Dynamics-546651,WPIEA2024062,"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/23/2024

The Dynamic Effects of Local Labor Market Shocks on Small Firms in The United States,"Philip Barrett, Sophia Chen, Li Lin, Anke Weber","We use payroll data on over 1 million workers at 80,000 small firms to construct county-month measures of employment, hours, and wages that correct for dynamic changes in sample composition in response to business cycle fluctuations. We use this to estimate the response of small firms' employment, hours and wages following tighter local labor market conditions. We find that employment and hours per worker fall and wages rise. This is consistent with the predictions of the response to a demand shock in the well-known “jobs ladder” model of labor markets. To check this interpretation, we show our results hold when instrumenting for local demand using county-level Department of Defense contract spending. Correction for dynamic sample bias is important -- without it, the hours fall by only one third as much and wages increase by double.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/22/The-Dynamic-Effects-of-Local-Labor-Market-Shocks-on-Small-Firms-in-The-United-States-546648,WPIEA2024063,"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/23/2024

Economic research encompasses growth, employment, productivity, and income inequality effects, while regulation covers market competition, data privacy, copyright, national security, ethics concerns, and financial stability. We find that: (i) theoretical research agrees that AI will affect most occupations and transform growth, but empirical findings are inconclusive on employment and productivity effects; (ii) regulation has focused primarily on topics not explored by the academic literature; (iii) across countries, regulations differ widely in scope and approaches and face difficult trade-offs.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/22/The-Economic-Impacts-and-the-Regulation-of-AI-A-Review-of-the-Academic-Literature-and-546645,WPIEA2024065,"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/23/2024

Effects of COVID-19 Shutdowns on Domestic Violence in the U.S.,"Yutong Chen, Amalia R. Miller, Carmit Segal, Melissa K. Spencer","This chapter examines the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on domestic violence (DV) in the United States. Despite widespread concerns that pandemic shutdowns could increase DV, initial studies found mixed evidence that varied across data sources and locations. We review the evolving literature on the effects of the pandemic and highlight results from studies that examine multiple measures of DV across a common set of large cities. These studies show that the conflicting early results are due to opposite effects of pandemic shutdowns on two measures of DV in police data: an increase in domestic violence 911 calls and a decrease in DV crime reports. In theory, this divergence can come from either higher DV reporting rates, possibly because of additional media attention to DV and greater third-party calling, or from lower policing intensity for DV crimes. Prior evidence from police data and other sources supports the conclusion that the increase in calls came from greater reporting, while the incidence of criminal DV decreased. Finally, we present new evidence drawing on police and hospitals records from across the state of California to show that DV crimes and hospital emergency department (ED) visits were both lower during pandemic shutdowns.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32259,32259,24-Mar,NBER,3/25/2024
Navigating Higher Education Insurance: An Experimental Study on Demand and Adverse Selection,"Sidhya Balakrishnan, Eric Bettinger, Michael S. Kofoed, Dubravka Ritter, Douglas A. Webber, Ege Aksu, Jonathan S. Hartley","We conduct a survey-based experiment with 2,776 students at a non-profit university to analyze income insurance demand in education financing. We offered students a hypothetical choice: either a federal loan with income-driven repayment or an income-share agreement (ISA), with randomized framing of downside protections. Emphasizing income insurance increased ISA uptake by 43%. We observe that students are responsive to changes in contract terms and possible student loan cancellation, which is evidence of preference adjustment or adverse selection. Our results indicate that framing specific terms can increase demand for higher education insurance to potentially address risk for students with varying outcomes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32260,32260,24-Mar,NBER,3/25/2024
Attribute-based Subsidies and Market Power: an Application to Electric Vehicles,"Panle Jia Barwick, Hyuk-Soo Kwon, Shanjun Li","Attribute-based subsidies (ABS) are commonly used to promote the diffusion of energy-efficient products, whose manufacturers often wield significant market power. We develop a theoretical framework for the optimal design of ABS to account for endogenous product attributes, environmental externalities, and market power. We then estimate an equilibrium model of China's vehicle market under ABS and conduct counterfactual simulations to evaluate the welfare impacts of various subsidy designs. Compared to the uniform subsidies, ABS lead to higher product quality and are more effective in mitigating quantity distortions, albeit with a modest environmental cost. Between 42% to 62% of welfare gains under ABS relative to uniform subsidies are attributed to more desirable product attributes, with the remainder explained by reductions in market power distortions. Allowing subsidy redistribution through product-level subsidies, as suggested by our theoretical model, further enhances welfare gains by an additional 34% to 62%. Among the ABS designs, China's notched subsidy design based on driving range leads to vehicle downsizing that undermines welfare benefits. Subsidies based on battery capacity, as implemented in the U.S., achieve the highest welfare gains by effectively balancing market power and environmental impacts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32264,32264,24-Mar,NBER,3/25/2024
3D-PCA: Factor Models with Restrictions,Martin Lettau,"This paper proposes latent factor models for multidimensional panels called 3D-PCA.  Factor weights are constructed from a small set of dimension-specific building blocks, which give rise to proportionality restrictions of factor weights.  While the set of feasible factors is restricted, factors with long/short structures often found in pricing factors are admissible.  I estimate the model using a 3-dimensional data set of double-sorted portfolios of 11 characteristics.  Factors estimated by 3D-PCA have higher Sharpe ratios and smaller cross-sectional pricing errors than models with PCA or Fama-French factors.  Since factor weights are subject to restrictions, the number of free parameters is small.  Consequently, the model produces robust results in short time series and performs well in recursive out-of-sample estimations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32261,32261,24-Mar,NBER,3/25/2024

The Distributional Impact of Sectoral Supply and Demand Shifts: A Unified Framework,"Nittai K.

Yet, the distributional welfare consequences of these shifts are not well understood. We address this gap by developing an analytical framework that jointly integrates supply-side and demand-side heterogeneity without imposing specific functional forms on consumption and production. This enables us to identify the key forces that shape the distributional welfare impact of sector-specific supply and demand shifts—in terms of consumer preferences and sectoral production functions. We estimate key parameters and quantify the heterogeneous welfare effects of sectoral shifts, revealing significant variation in their impact.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32271,32271,24-Mar,NBER,3/25/2024
Measuring the Commercial Potential of Science,"Roger Masclans-Armengol, Sharique Hasan, Wesley M. Cohen","This paper uses a large language model to develop an ex-ante measure of the commercial potential of scientific findings. In addition to validating the measure against the typical holdout sample, we validate it externally against 1.) the progression of scientific findings through a major university’s technology transfer process and 2.) firms’ use of the academic science of major American research universities. We then illustrate the measure’s utility by applying it to two questions. First, does the patenting of academic research by universities impede its breadth of use by firms? Second, to illustrate how this measure can advance our understanding of the determinants of firms’ use of science generally, we use it to analyze how one factor, universities’ reputations for generating commercializable science, impacts firms’ use of academic science. For the former question, using our measure to control for commercializable science, we find that patenting does not dampen the dissemination of academic science in industry. For the second, we find that reputation per se, apart from the production of commercializable science, impacts industry’s use of science, especially for that science with high commercial potential, implying that the commercializable science of less prominent universities is disproportionately overlooked by industry.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32262,32262,24-Mar,NBER,3/25/2024
Shortening the Path to Productive Investment: Evidence from Input Fairs and Cash Transfers in Malawi,"Shilpa Aggarwal, Dahyeon Jeong, Naresh Kumar, David Sungho Park, Jonathan Robinson, Alan Spearot","While cash transfers consistently show large effects on immediate outcomes like consumption, limited access to markets may mute their impact on productive investment. In an experiment in Malawi, we cross-cut cash transfers with an ""input fair,"" designed to reduce transport costs to access agricultural inputs. Cash alone increases investment by 27%, while the joint provision of cash and the input fair increases investment by about 40%; thus, the incremental effect of the input fair is equivalent to about a 50% increase compared to the effect of cash alone.

The Long-Run Impacts of Public Industrial Investment on Local Development and Economic Mobility: Evidence from World War II,"Andrew Garin, Jonathan L. Rothbaum","This paper studies the long-run effects of government-led construction of manufacturing plants on the regions where they were built and on individuals from those regions. Specifically, we examine publicly financed plants built in dispersed locations outside of major urban centers for security reasons during the United States' industrial mobilization for World War II. Wartime plant construction had large and persistent impacts on local development, characterized by an expansion of relatively high-wage manufacturing employment throughout the postwar era. These benefits were shared by incumbent residents; we find men born before WWII in counties where plants were built earned $1,200 (in 2020 dollars) or 2.5 percent more per year in adulthood relative to those born in counterfactual comparison regions, with larger benefits accruing to children of lower-income parents. The balance of evidence suggests that these individuals benefited primarily from the local expansion of higher-wage jobs to which they had access as adults, rather than because of developmental effects from exposure to better environments during childhood.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32265,32265,24-Mar,NBER,3/25/2024
Does Consolidation in Insurer Markets affect Insurance Enrollment and Drug Expenditures? Evidence from Medicare Part D,"Pinka Chatterji, Chun-Yu Ho, Tao Jin, Yichuan Wang","Since the inception of Medicare Part D in 2006, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and regulatory changes have led to increased concentration and reduced plan variety in the standalone prescription drug plan (PDP) portion of the market. We examine how this industry consolidation affects Medicare beneficiaries’ enrollment in PDPs and their out-of-pocket (OOP) drug expenditures using individual-level data from the 2006-2018 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) merged with PDP market-level characteristics. Overall, we find that lower plan variety in the PDP market decreases the likelihood that elderly individuals enroll in PDPs, and higher PDP market concentration increases OOP drug expenditures. Our main results are robust to considering possible effects of unobserved individual-level heterogeneity, region-specific time trends, and entry/exit of insurers, as well as to the use of an alternative identification scheme based on a quasi-experimental design. Further, we find that younger, more advantaged, and healthier individuals respond differently to industry consolidation compared to their older, less advantaged, and sicker counterparts. The former groups are more likely to adjust their PDP enrollment in response to reduced PDP variety and have higher OOP drug expenditures in response to increased PDP market concentration compared to the latter groups. Finally, we find that not only do lower PDP variety and greater PDP market concentration directly affect PDP enrollment and OOP drug expenditures, but these changes also affect Medicare beneficiaries indirectly through impacting PDP characteristics.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32267,32267,24-Mar,NBER,3/25/2024
Comprehensive OOS Evaluation of Predictive Algorithms with Statistical Decision Theory,"Jeff Dominitz, Charles F. Manski","We argue that comprehensive out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation using statistical decision theory (SDT) should replace the current practice of K-fold and Common Task Framework validation in machine learning (ML) research. SDT provides a formal framework for performing comprehensive OOS evaluation across all possible (1) training samples, (2) populations that may generate training data, and (3) populations of prediction interest. Regarding feature (3), we emphasize that SDT requires the practitioner to directly confront the possibility that the future may not look like the past and to account for a possible need to extrapolate from one population to another when building a predictive algorithm. SDT is simple in abstraction, but it is often computationally demanding to implement. We discuss progress in tractable implementation of SDT when prediction accuracy is measured by mean square error or by misclassification rate. We summarize research studying settings in which the training data will be generated from a subpopulation of the population of prediction interest. We also consider conditional prediction with alternative restrictions on the state space of possible populations that may generate training data. We conclude by calling on ML researchers to join with econometricians and statisticians in expanding the domain within which implementation of SDT is tractable.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32269,32269,24-Mar,NBER,3/25/2024
Ban-the-Box Laws: Fair and Effective?,"Robert Kaestner, Xufei Wang","Ban-the-box (BTB) laws are a widely used public policy rooted in employment law related to unnecessarily exclusionary hiring practices. BTB laws are intended to improve the employment opportunities of those with criminal backgrounds by giving them a fair chance during the hiring process. Prior research on the effectiveness of these laws in meeting their objective is limited and inconclusive. In this article, we extend the prior literature in two ways: we expand the years of analysis to a period of rapid expansion of BTB laws and we examine different types of BTB laws depending on the employers affected (e.g., public sector). Results indicate that BTB laws, any type of BTB law or BTB laws covering different types of employers, have no systematic or statistically significant association with employment of low-educated men, both young and old and across racial and ethnic groups. We speculate that the lack of effectiveness of BTB laws stems from the difficulty in enforcing such laws and already high rates of employer willingness to hire those with criminal histories.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32273,32273,24-Mar,NBER,3/25/2024

There is limited evidence of heterogeneity in treatment to be found along demographic, academic, or financial lines for students in our sample. The insurance framing has, by far, the largest effect on take-up. We do find strong suggestive evidence of adverse selection based on the likelihood of future incomes being low. Our results suggest that students are not necessarily thinking about income risk or about the potential benefits of educational insurance when they choose how to finance their studies, but that educational and loan providers can help make the potential need for educational insurance salient for borrowers by thoroughly explaining the costs and benefits of such insurance. We further observe that students are responsive to changes in contract terms and possible student loan cancellation, which is evidence of preference adjustment or adverse selection.

The Adoption of Non-Rival Inputs and Firm Scope,Xian Jiang and Hannah Rubinton,"Custom software is distinct from other types of capital in that it is non-rival---once a firm makes an investment in custom software, it can be used simultaneously across its many establishments. Using confidential US Census data, we document that while firms with more establishments are more likely to invest in custom software, they spend less on it as a share of total capital expenditure. We explain these empirical patterns by developing a model that incorporates the non-rivalry of custom software. In the model, firms choose whether to adopt custom software, the intensity of their investment, and their scope, balancing the cost of managing multiple establishments with the increasing returns to scope from the non-rivalrous custom software investment. Using the calibrated model, we assess the extent to which the decline in the rental rate of custom software over the past 40 years can account for a number of macroeconomic trends, including increases in firm scope and concentration.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-005,2024-005A,24-Mar,FED-STLOUIS,3/26/2024
"Business as usual: bank climate commitments, lending, and engagement","Parinitha Sastry, Emil Verner, David Marqués-Ibáñez","This paper studies the impact of voluntary climate commitments by banks on their lending activity. We use administrative data on the universe of bank lending from 19 European countries. There is strong selection into commitments, with increased participation by the largest banks and banks with the most pre-existing exposure to high-polluting industries. Setting a commitment leads to a boost in a lender’s ESG rating. Lenders reduce credit in sectors they have targeted as high priority for decarbonization. However, climate-aligned banks do not change their lending or loan pricing differentially compared to banks without climate commitments, suggesting they are not actively divesting. We can reject that climate-aligned lenders divest from firms in targeted sectors by more than 2.6%. Firm borrowers are no more likely to set climate targets after their lender sets a climate target, which casts doubt on active engagement by lenders. These results call into question the efficacy of voluntary commitments.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2921~603e225101.en.pdf?f3854e151126bea0371149d197b37353,2921,22-Mar-24,ECB,3/26/2024
The Causal Effects of Expected Depreciations,"Martha Elena Delgado, Juan Herreño, Marc Hofstetter, Mathieu Pedemonte","We estimate the causal effects of a shift in the expected future exchange rate of a local currency against the US dollar on a representative sample of firms in an open economy. We survey a nationally representative sample of firms and provide the one-year-ahead nominal exchange rate forecast published by the local central bank to a random sub-sample of firm managers. The treatment is effective in shifting exchange rate and inflation expectations and perceptions. These effects are persistent and larger for non-exporting firms. Linking survey responses with administrative census data, we find that the treatment affects the dynamics of export and import quantities and prices at the firm level, with differential effects for exports to destination countries that use the US dollar as their currency.

The Fed Takes on Corporate Credit Risk: An Analysis of the Efficacy of the SMCCF ,"Simon Gilchrist, Bin Wei, Vivian Z. Yue, Egon Zakrajšek","This paper evaluates the efficacy of the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, a program designed to stabilize the U.S. corporate bond market during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program announcements on March 23 and April 9, 2020, significantly reduced investment-grade credit spreads across the maturity spectrum—irrespective of the program’s maturity-eligibility criterion—and ultimately restored the normal upward-sloping term structure of credit spreads. The Federal Reserve’s actual purchases reduced credit spreads of eligible bonds 3 basis points more than those of ineligible bonds, a sizable effect given the modest volume of purchases. A calibrated variant of the preferred habit model shows that a “dash for cash”—a selloff of shorter-term lowest-risk investment-grade bonds—combined with a spike in the arbitrageurs’ risk aversion, can account for the inversion of the investment-grade credit curve during the height of turmoil in the market. Consistent with the empirical findings, the Fed’s announcements, by reducing risk aversion and alleviating market segmentation, helped restore the upward-sloping credit curve in the investment-grade segment of the market. .",https://www.bostonfed.org//publications/research-department-working-paper/2024/the-fed-takes-on-corporate-credit-risk-an-analysis-of-the-efficacy-of-the-smccf,24-2,3/26/2024,FED-BOSTON,3/26/2024

The Impact of the 2022 Oil Embargo and Price Cap on Russian Oil Prices,"Lutz Kilian, David Rapson and Burkhard Schipper","This paper documents the effect of the oil embargo and price cap on Russian oil exports in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. We show that the embargo forced Russia to accept a $32/bbl discount on its Urals crude in March 2023 relative to January 2022, nearly half of which is directly attributable to the higher cost of shipping crude oil over longer distances, as Russia diverted much of its crude oil exports to India. Based on a calibrated model of global oil supply and demand, the remainder ($17/bbl) can be explained by increased Indian bargaining power. We also provide a similar analysis for the ESPO price discount on exports to China. In contrast, the price cap deprived Russia of the financial resources it spent on assembling a “shadow” fleet of tankers, but its effect on the Russian oil export price was negligible once the adoption of the price cap had facilitated the use of Western services to transport Russian oil to Asia.

Tax Revolts and Sovereign Defaults,"Fernando Arce, Jan Morgan, Nicolas Werquin","Protests and fiscal crises often coincide, with complex causal dynamics at play. We examine the interaction between tax revolts and sovereign risk using a quantitative
structural model calibrated to Argentina during the Macri administration (2015-2019). In the model, the government can be controlled by political parties with different preferences for redistribution. Households may opt to revolt in response to the fiscal policies of the ruler. While revolts entail economic costs, they also increase the likelihood of political turnover. Our model mirrors the data by generating political crises concurrent with fiscal turmoil. We find that left-leaning parties are more prone to default, while right-leaning parties sustain higher debt levels. Revolts impact default risk through two channels. First, political crises can increase sovereign risk by facilitating transitions from right-wing to left-wing administrations that culminate in default. Second, the threat of frequent revolts during default periods can deter the government and increase commitment. In our calibration, the latter channel dominates the former with revolts operating as an endogenous default cost. Relative to a model without revolts, our framework can sustain higher levels of debt and reduce the frequency of defaults.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-07,2024-07,24-Mar,FED-CHICAGO,3/27/2024

The common drivers of global liquidity flows include monetary policy in advanced economies and risk conditions. At the same time, the sensitivities of liquidity flows to changes in these drivers differ across institutions and have been evolving over time. Microprudential regulation of banks plays a role, influencing leverage and capitalization, changing sensitivities to shocks, and also driving risk migration from banks to nonbank financial institutions. Risk sensitivities and flightiness of global liquidity are now strongest in more leveraged nonbank financial institutions, raising challenges in stress episodes.

Open-Ended Treasury Purchases: From Market Functioning to Financial Easing,"Stefania D’Amico, Max Gillet, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, Tim Seida","We exploit the Fed’s Treasury purchases conducted from March 2020 to March 2022 to assess whether asset purchases can be tailored to accomplish different objectives: restoring market functioning and providing stimulus. We find that, on average, flow effects are significant in the market-functioning (MF) period (March-September 2020), while stock effects are strong in the QE period (September 2020-March 2022). In the MF period, the elevated frequency and size of the purchase operations allowed flow effects to greatly improve relative price deviations, especially at the long-end of the yield curve. But stock effects remained localized, thus not large enough to be stimulative. In contrast, in the QE period, stock effects were stimulative because cross-asset price impacts got larger as the Fed communication and implementation moved toward “traditional” QE, increasing purchases’ predictability. Lower uncertainty about the expected size and duration of total purchases facilitated their impounding into prices. Overall, these findings suggest that communication and implementation can be used to tailor the goals of asset purchases.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-08,2024-08,24-Mar,FED-CHICAGO,3/28/2024

TMOS indexes provide timely information on manufacturing activity in Texas, which is useful for understanding broader changes in regional economic conditions. This paper describes the survey methodology and analyzes the explanatory and predictive power of TMOS indexes with regard to other measures of state economic activity. Regression analysis shows that several TMOS indexes successfully track changes in Texas employment, gross domestic product and consumer price index.

"Distribution of Market Power, Endogenous Growth, and Monetary Policy","Yumeng Gu, Sanjay R.

Existing firms increase markups over time through successful innovation. Entrant innovation disrupts the accumulation of market power by incumbents. Using this environment, we highlight a novel misallocation channel for monetary policy. A contractionary monetary policy shock causes an increase in markup dispersion across firms by discouraging entrant innovation relative to incumbent innovation.

Information disclosure and information acquisition in credit markets,Paolo Siciliani and Peter Eccles,"We analyse how the design of credit registers can influence competition in lending markets. We focus on a particular design choice, namely whether or not credit registers should record previous loan applications that did not result to a subsequent loan origination. This design choice can have subtle effects to the extent that the fact that a prospective borrower has previously applied with other lenders for the same loan can be informative. This is particularly likely to be the case if the failed or withdrawn application was with an innovative lender that is better at screening prospective borrowers thanks to the use of Big Data-driven methodologies (eg ML and AI) alongside the traditional credit scoring approach. On the one hand, we find that when credit registers record previous loan requests rates advertised to borrowers are lower than when credit registers do not record loan requests. On the other hand, the incentives to invest in advanced screening technologies are weakened as a result.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/information-disclosure-and-information-acquisition-in-credit-markets,1067,"Thu, 28 Mar 2",BOE,3/29/2024

We provide the asymptotic properties of factor-model-based expected return estimators, which yield the standard errors for risk premium estimators for individual assets. We show that using factor-model-based risk premium estimates leads to sizable precision gains compared to using historical averages.

How Much Does Racial Bias Affect Mortgage Lending? Evidence from Human and Algorithmic Credit Decisions,"Neil Bhutta, Aurel Hizmo, Daniel Ringo","Minority applicants tend to have significantly lower credit scores, higher leverage, and are less likely than White applicants to receive algorithmic approval from raceblind government-automated underwriting systems (AUS). Observable applicant-risk factors explain most of the racial disparities in lender denials. Further, we exploit the AUS data to show there are risk factors we do not directly observe, and our analysis indicates that these factors explain at least some of the residual 1-2 percentage point denial gaps.

How Private Equity Fuels Non-Bank Lending,"Sharjil Haque, Simon Mayer, and Teng Wang","We show how private equity (PE) buyouts fuel loan sales and non-bank participation in the U.S. syndicated loan market. Combining loan-level data from the Shared National Credit register with buyout deals from Pitchbook, we find that PE-backed loans feature lower bank monitoring, lower loan shares retained by the lead bank, and more loan sales to non-bank financial intermediaries. For PE-backed loans, the sponsor’s reputation and the strength of its relationship with the lead bank further reduce the lead bank’s retained share and monitoring. Our results suggest that PE sponsor engagement substitutes for bank monitoring, allowing banks to retain less skin-in-the game in the loans they originate and to sell greater loan shares to non-banks.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/how-private-equity-fuels-non-bank-lending.htm,2024-015,24-Mar,FED-BOARD,3/30/2024
Call of Duty: Industrial Policy for the Post-Oil Era,"Reda Cherif, Fuad Hasanov, Madi Sarsenbayev","Oil-exporting economies face the risk of an acceleration in the energy transition. A risk-based approach calls for urgent preparation for the post-oil era by diversifying exports and transforming the prevailing growth model. We outline the principles of industrial policy to achieve this objective based on the experience of the Asian Miracles and propose a sketch of the strategy required to transform these principles into practice. The key component of the strategy is to select sectors along two dimensions—proximity to the current production structure or capabilities set and a timeframe for results to materialize. The three strategies—snail crawl, leapfrogging, and moonshots—determine how far from the current production structure the selected sectors are. These sectors need to show results both in the short run to jumpstart growth and ensure policy continuity—“quick wins”—and the long run to create a new growth model—“transformative gains.” We argue that the strategy should focus on supporting the exports of sophisticated sectors in both manufacturing and services while capitalizing on complex tasks and activities in existing industries but should leave non-sophisticated sectors such as tourism and non-tradable services to the private sector.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/29/Call-of-Duty-Industrial-Policy-for-the-Post-Oil-Era-546941,WPIEA2024074,"Fri, 29 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/30/2024
Central Bank Exit Strategies Domestic Transmission and International Spillovers,"Christopher J. Erceg, Marcin Kolasa, Jesper Lindé, Haroon Mumtaz, Pawel Zabczyk","We study alternative approaches to the withdrawal of prolonged unconventional monetary stimulus (“exit strategies”) by central banks in large, advanced economies. We first show empirically that large-scale asset purchases affect the exchange rate and domestic and foreign term premiums more strongly than conventional short-term policy rate changes when normalizing by the effects on domestic GDP. We then build a two-country New Keynesian model that features segmented bond markets, cognitive discounting and strategic complementarities in price setting that is consistent with these findings. The model implies that quantitative easing (QE) is the only effective way to provide monetary stimulus when policy rates are persistently constrained by the effective lower bound, and that QE is likely to have larger domestic output effects than quantitative tightening (QT). We demonstrate that “exit strategies” by large advanced economies that rely heavily on QT can trigger sizeable inflation-output tradeoffs in foreign recipient economies through the exchange rate and term premium channels. We also show that these tradeoffs are likely to be stronger in emerging market economies, especially those with fixed exchange rates.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/29/Central-Bank-Exit-Strategies-Domestic-Transmission-and-International-Spillovers-546938,WPIEA2024073,"Fri, 29 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/30/2024
E-Money and Monetary Policy Transmission,"Zixuan Huang, Amina Lahreche, Mika Saito, Ursula Wiriadinata","E-money development has important yet theoretically ambiguous consequences for monetary policy transmission, because nonbank deposit-taking e-money issuers (EMIs) (e.g., mobile network operators) can either complement or substitute banks. Case studies of e-money regulations point to complementarity of EMIs with banks, implying that the development of e-money could deepen financial intermediation and strengthen monetary policy transmission. The issue is further explored with panel data, on both monthly (covering 21 countries) and annual (covering 47 countries) frequencies, over 2001 to 2019. We use a two-way fixed effect estimator to estimate the causal effects of e-money development on monetary policy transmission. We find that e-money development has accompanied stronger monetary policy transmission (measured by the responsiveness of interest rates to the policy rate), growth in bank deposits and credit, and efficiency gains in financial intermediation (measured by the lending-to-deposit rate spread). Evidence is more pronounced in countries where e-money development takes off in a context of limited financial inclusion.

Leveraging quasi-experimental variation in 3G availability from lightning strikes and incidental coverage, we show that mobile connectivity steers borrowers from microfinance to commercial banks and improves loan terms. These effects are partly due to the role of 3G internet in facilitating the acquisition of land titles from the reform, used as a collateral for bank loans and mortgages.

Public Debt Dynamics During the Climate Transition,"Daniel Garcia-Macia, Waikei R Lam, Anh D. M. Nguyen","Managing the climate transition presents policymakers with a tradeoff between achieving climate goals, fiscal sustainability, and political feasibility, which calls for a fiscal balancing act with the right mix of policies. This paper develops a tractable dynamic general equilibrium model to quantify the fiscal impacts of various climate policy packages aimed at reaching net zero emissions by mid-century. Our simulations show that relying primarily on spending measures to deliver on climate ambitions will be costly, possibly raising debt by 45-50 percent of GDP by 2050. However, a balanced mix of carbon-pricing and spending-based policies can deliver on net zero with a much smaller fiscal cost, limiting the increase in public debt to 10-15 percent of GDP by 2050. Carbon pricing is central not only as an effective tool for emissions reduction but also as a revenue source. Delaying carbon pricing action could increase costs, especially if less effective measures are scaled up to meet climate targets. Technology spillovers can reduce the costs but bottlenecks in green investment could unwind the gains and slow the transition.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/29/Public-Debt-Dynamics-During-the-Climate-Transition-546929,WPIEA2024071,"Fri, 29 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/30/2024

RCO also robustly predicts downside risks to GDP growth even after controlling for aggregate bank credit growth and financial conditions, among other determinants.

Trade in Low Carbon Technologies: The Role of Climate and Trade Policies,Samuel Pienknagura,"Curbing carbon emissions to meet the targets set in the Paris Agreement requires the deployment of low carbon technologies (LCTs) at a global scale. This paper assesses the role of climate and trade policies in fostering LCT diffusion through trade. Leveraging a comprehensive database of climate policies and a new database identifying trade in low carbon technologies and the tariffs applied to these goods, this paper shows that the introduction of new climate policies has a positive and significant impact on LCT imports. Zooming into specific climate policies, the paper finds that, except for non-binding ones, all climate policies stimulate LCT imports. The paper also highlights the role of trade policies as an engine of LCT diffusion—reductions in tariffs applied on LCT goods have a sizeable impact on LCT imports. On the flip side, results suggest that more protectionist measures would impede the spread of low-carbon technologies.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/03/29/Trade-in-Low-Carbon-Technologies-The-Role-of-Climate-and-Trade-Policies-546944,WPIEA2024075,"Fri, 29 Mar 2024 ",IMF,3/30/2024
Marginal Returns to Public Universities,Jack Mountjoy,"This paper studies the causal impacts of public universities on the outcomes of their marginally admitted students. I use administrative admission records spanning all 35 public universities in Texas, which collectively enroll 10 percent of American public university students, to systematically identify and employ decentralized cutoffs in SAT/ACT scores that generate discontinuities in admission and enrollment. The typical marginally admitted student completes an additional year of education in the four-year sector, is 12 percentage points more likely to earn a bachelor’s degree, and eventually earns 5-10 percent more than their marginally rejected but otherwise identical counterpart. Marginally admitted students pay no additional tuition costs thanks to offsetting grant aid; cost-beneﬁt calculations show internal rates of return of 19-23 percent for the marginal students themselves, 10-12 percent for society (which must pay for the additional education), and 3-4 percent for the government budget. Finally, I develop a method to disentangle separate effects for students on the extensive margin of the four-year sector versus those who would fall back to another four-year school if rejected.

"Deposit Insurance, Uninsured Depositors, and Liquidity Risk During Panics","Matthew S. Jaremski, Steven Sprick Schuster","The lack of universal deposit insurance coverage can create liquidity risk during financial crises. This aspect of deposit insurance is hard to test in modern data because of the broad coverage of most systems. We, therefore, study the role that the U.S. Postal Savings System played in commercial bank closures during the Great Depression. The system offered households a federally insured deposit account at post offices throughout the nation, and its structure provides a near-ideal environment to identify this competitive liquidity risk during a crisis. We find that banks that operated nearby a post office that accepted deposits were more likely to close between 1929 and 1935. We further make use of a structural change in the availability of postal depositories in the early 1910 to estimate an IV regression that confirms the results. In either model, the effect is strongest for those banks with low reserves, suggesting that the mechanism was through depositor withdrawals rather than other factors.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32284,32284,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024
'Morality and Political Economy' from the Vantage Point of Economics,Benjamin Enke,"This article calls for a greater integration of moral psychology and political economy. While these disciplines were initially deeply intertwined, cross-disciplinary exchange became rare throughout the 20th century. More recently, the tide has shifted again – social scientists of different backgrounds recognized that morality and politico-economic outcomes influence each other in rich bi-directional ways. Because psychologists and economists possess distinct and complementary skill sets, part of this movement consists of productive ‘economic imperialism’ – economists leveraging their empirical toolkit to test and substantiate theories from moral psychology at scale or in the wild. To illustrate this, I present two case studies of recent economics research on prominent ideas in moral psychology. First, the theory that morality is ultimately economically functional – that it evolved as a form of ‘psychological and biological police’ to enforce cooperation in economic production and exchange. Second, that the structure of morality shapes political views and polarization, including on economic issues such as taxation and redistribution. I conclude from these case studies that economists have much to gain from integrating more ideas from moral psychology, and that moral psychologists will be able to make an even more compelling case that morality and politico-economic outcomes influence each other if they engage with research in economics.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32279,32279,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024
The Influence of Occupational Licensing on Workforce Transitions to Retirement,"Yun taek Oh, Morris M.

Labor market institutions such as occupational licensing may influence how individuals transition to retirement. When and how workers transition from career jobs to full retirement may contribute to pre- and post-retirement well-being. Previous investigations of retirement pathways focused on the patterns and outcomes of retirement transitions, yet the influence of occupational licensing on retirement transition has not been analyzed. In this study, we use the Current Population Survey and Survey of Income and Program Participation to investigate how occupational licensing influences American later-career workers’ choice of retirement pathways. Our results show that licensed workers are less likely to choose to change careers but more likely to reduce work hours in transitioning out of the workforce. These results are consistent with the findings that licensed workers receive more benefits in the form of preferable retirement options, suggesting that these workers tend to have higher wages, benefits, and flexibility even toward the end of their careers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32292,32292,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024

In surveys, nearly 80% of CFOs report using an elevated hurdle rate, the implications of which we explore in a delegated bargaining model. We show that elevated hurdle rates can convey a bargaining advantage that exceeds the opportunity cost of forgone projects, whether hurdle rate buffers arise for strategic or non-strategic reasons. Using CFO survey data, we find buffer use is negatively related to the cost of capital and ex ante bargaining power, consistent with the model, and that realized returns exhibit “beat the hurdle rate benchmark” behavior.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32283,32283,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024

Using both equity and debt benchmarks to measure risk, a typical private debt fund produces an insignificant abnormal return to its investors. However, gross-of-fee abnormal returns are positive, and using only debt benchmarks also leads to positive abnormal returns as funds contain equity risks. The rates at which private debt funds lend appear to be high enough to offset the funds’ fees and risks, but not high enough to exceed both their fees and investors' risk-adjusted rates of return.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32278,32278,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024

Empirical analyses, based on a LASSO Instrumental Variable approach and a novel comprehensive dataset spanning nearly two decades, confirm our theoretical predictions. We find robust evidence that expropriation risk, such as corruption, negatively impacts innovation by reducing R&D expenditure, human capital in R&D, number of patents, scientific publications, and the Economic Complexity Index, which is our proxy for technical progress.

Using administrative data which covers the full universe of faculty salaries, we find strong evidence that unionization leads to both average salary gains and compression of the distribution of salaries. Our estimates indicate that salaries increase on average by 2 to over 5 percent over the first 6 years post unionization. These effects are driven largely by gains in the bottom half of the wage distribution with little evidence of any impact at the top end.

Promoting Public Health with Blunt Instruments: Evidence from Vaccine Mandates,"Rahi Abouk, John S.

There are long-standing worker shortages in the U.S. healthcare industry,  pre-dating the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 vaccine mandates on shortages is ex ante ambiguous. If mandates increase perceived safety of the healthcare industry, marginal workers may be drawn to healthcare, relaxing shortages. On the other hand, if marginal workers are vaccine hesitant or averse, then mandates may push workers away from the industry and exacerbate shortages. We combine monthly data from the Current Population Survey 2021 to 2022 with difference-in-differences methods to study the effects of state vaccine mandates on the probability of working in healthcare, and of employment transitions into and out of the industry. Our findings suggest that vaccine mandates may have worsened healthcare workforce shortages: following adoption of a state-level mandate, the probability of working in the healthcare industry declines by 6%. Effects are larger among workers in healthcare-specific occupations, who leave the industry at higher rates in response to mandates and are slower to be replaced than workers in non-healthcare occupations.

"When to Appease and When to Punish: Hitler, Putin, and Hamas","David K. Levine, Lee E. Ohanian","Much has been written about deterrence, the process of committing to punish an adversary to prevent an attack. But in sufficiently rich environments where attacks evolve over time, formulating a strategy involves not only deterrence but also appeasement, the less costly process of not responding to an attack. This paper develops a model that integrates these two processes to analyze the equilibrium time paths of attacks, punishment, and appeasement. We study an environment in which a small attack is launched and can be followed by a larger attack. There are pooling and separating equilibria. The pooling equilibrium turns the common intuition that appeasement is a sign of weakness, inviting subsequent attacks, on its head, because appeasement is a sign of strength in the pooling case. In contrast, the separating equilibrium captures the common intuition that appeasement is a sign of weakness, but only because deterrence in this equilibrium fails. We interpret several episodes of aggression, appeasement, and deterrence: Neville Chamberlain's responses to Hitler, Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Israel's response to Hamas, Turkey's invasion of Cyprus, and Serbia's attacks in Kosovo.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32280,32280,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024

"Book Value Risk Management of Banks: Limited Hedging, HTM Accounting, and Rising Interest Rates","João Granja, Erica Xuewei Jiang, Gregor Matvos, Tomasz Piskorski, Amit Seru","In the face of rising interest rates in 2022, banks mitigated interest rate exposure of the accounting value of their assets but left the vast majority of their long-duration assets exposed to interest rate risk. Data from call reports and SEC filings shows that only 6% of U.S. banking assets used derivatives to hedge their interest rate risk, and even heavy users of derivatives left most assets unhedged. The banks most vulnerable to asset declines and solvency runs decreased existing hedges, focusing on short-term gains but risking further losses if rates rose. Instead of hedging the market value risk of bank asset declines, banks used accounting reclassification to diminish the impact of interest rate increases on book capital. Banks reclassified $1 trillion in securities as held-to-maturity (HTM) which insulated these assets book values from interest rate fluctuations. More vulnerable banks were more likely to reclassify. Extending Jiang et al.’s (2023) solvency bank run model, we show that capital regulation could address run risk by encouraging capital raising, but its effectiveness depends on the regulatory capital definitions and can by eroded by the use of HTM accounting. Including deposit franchise value in regulatory capital calculations without considering run risk could weaken capital regulation’s ability to prevent runs. Our findings have implications for regulatory capital accounting and risk management practices in the banking sector.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32293,32293,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024
Invoicing Currency Choice: Strategic Complementarities and Currency Matching,"Yushi Yoshida, Junko Shimizu, Takatoshi Ito, Kiyotaka Sato, Taiyo Yoshimi, Uraku Yoshimoto","Japanese exporters’ choice of invoice currencies is investigated using newly available official Customs declaration data, which records detailed information, including the trading partners’ names, invoicing currency, and product descriptions. The strategic complementarity mechanism, that is, choosing the same invoice currency as others in the same industry or the same destination market, is found among Japanese exporters. We propose the “broad two-way exporters” whose export destinations and import origins do not necessarily match and the “narrow two-way exporters” whose export destination and import origins match in the same year. It is found that currency matching for exports and imports is as essential as strategic complementarity for two-way exporters, regardless of dominant currency, producer currency, or local currency invoicing. However, as one of this paper’s novelty, we found evidence that newly entering two-way exporters are less concerned about currency matching. Therefore, the currency matching mechanism for two-way exporters is gradually formed as they continue to survive in international markets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32276,32276,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024
Not in My Backyard? The Local Impact of Wind and Solar Parks in Brazil,"Fabian Scheifele, David Popp","Support from local citizens is important for the scale-up of renewable energy. We investigate the impact of utility-scale wind and solar parks on employment, GDP and public finances in Brazilian municipalities using a difference-in-differences design with matching. We find a positive employment impact of 1-1.5 jobs/MW in the 15 months preceding the commissioning of a solar park, when the park is under construction, but no impacts thereafter. For wind, we find no employment impacts during the construction phase and potentially a small impact of 0.2-0.25 jobs/MW in the 12 months following commissioning. In the year after commissioning, GDP increases 23% for an average sized solar park and 12% for an average sized wind project. The impacts only decrease slightly in the following years. We also find significant persistent fiscal revenue impacts in wind compared to only a one-time tax revenue increase in solar at the time of construction. Our results provide different implications for policymakers that want to advocate for renewable energy in their towns. While for solar, the main benefit constitutes a short-term increase in low-skilled employment and public revenues, wind energy provides more long-term financial benefits but less local employment opportunities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32274,32274,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024
Blended Finance,"Caroline Flammer, Thomas Giroux, Geoffrey Heal","Blended finance---the use of public and philanthropic funding to crowd in private capital---is a potential way to finance a more sustainable world. While blended finance holds the promise of being catalytic in mobilizing vast amounts of private capital, little is known about this practice. In this paper, we provide a conceptual framework that formalizes the decision-making of development finance institutions (DFIs) that engage in blended finance. We then provide empirical evidence on blended finance using data from a major DFI. The key variable we study is the level of concessionality, which captures the subsidy from the blended co-investment. Our findings indicate that DFIs provide higher concessionality for projects that have a higher sustainability impact per dollar invested. Moreover, the concessionality is higher for projects in countries with higher political risk and a higher degree of information asymmetries. In such cases, the blending tends to also include risk-management provisions. These findings are consistent with the predictions from our conceptual framework, in which DFIs have a limited budget that they allocate across projects to create societal value.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32287,32287,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024
"The Missing Link? Using LinkedIn Data to Measure Race, Ethnic, and Gender Differences in Employment Outcomes at Individual Companies","Alexander Berry, Elizabeth M. Maloney, David Neumark","Stronger enforcement of discrimination laws can help to reduce disparities in economic outcomes with respect to race, ethnicity, and gender in the United States. However, the data necessary to detect possible discrimination and to act to counter it is not publicly available – in particular, data on racial, ethnic, and gender disparities within specific companies. In this paper, we explore and develop methods to use information extracted from publicly available LinkedIn data to measure the racial, ethnic, and gender composition of company workforces. We use predictive tools based on both names and pictures to identify race, ethnicity, and gender. We show that one can use LinkedIn data to obtain reasonably reliable measures of workforce demographic composition by race, ethnicity, and gender, based on validation exercises comparing estimates from scraped LinkedIn data to two sources – ACS data, and company diversity or EEO-1 reports. Next, we apply our methods to study the race, ethnic, and gender composition of workers who were hired and those who experienced mass layoffs at two large companies. Finally, we explore using LinkedIn data to measure race, ethnic, and gender differences in promotion.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32294,32294,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024
Aggregate Demand Externality and Self-Fulfilling Default Cycles,"Jess Benhabib, Feng Dong, Pengfei Wang, Zhenyang Xu","We develop a model of self-fulfilling default cycles with demand externality a la Dixit- Stiglitz to explain the recurrent clustered defaults observed in the data. The literature reports that observable fundamental factors alone are insufficient to explain the cluster. A decline in aggregate output reduces the value of firms and increases their probability of default. As defaults take more firms out of production, aggregate output declines further, creating a positive feedback loop that generates multiple equilibria and self-fulfilling default cycles. Our global analysis using Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation reveals the existence of multiple or even infinite paths that satisfy all equilibrium conditions. Moreover, a family of periodic orbits can emerge in the perfect foresight equilibrium. Our model is consistent with the view that business cycles arise largely because the economy’s internal forces tend to endogenously generate cyclical mechanisms (Beaudry et al., 2020).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32291,32291,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024

Contracts with Interdependent Preferences,"Debraj Ray, Marek Weretka","This paper studies contracting between a principal and multiple agents. The setup is classical except for the assumption that agents have interdependent preferences. We characterize cost effective contracts, and relate the direction of co-movement in rewards — “joint liability” (positive) or “tournaments” (negative) — to the assumed structure of preference interdependence. We also study the implications of preference interdependence for the principal’s payoffs. We identify two asymmetries. First, the optimal contract leans towards joint liability rather than tournaments, especially in larger teams, in a sense made precise in the paper. Second, when the mechanism-design problem is augmented by robustness constraints designed to eliminate multiple equilibria, the principal may prefer teams linked via adversarial rather than altruistic preferences.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32290,32290,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024
The Geography of Capital Allocation in the Euro Area,"Roland Beck, Antonio Coppola, Angus J. Lewis, Matteo Maggiori, Martin Schmitz, Jesse Schreger","We assess the pattern of Euro Area financial integration adjusting for the role of “onshore offshore financial centers” (OOFCs) within the Euro Area. The OOFCs of Luxembourg, Ireland, and the Netherlands serve dual roles as both hubs of investment fund intermediation and centers of securities issuance by foreign firms. We provide new estimates of Euro Area countries' bilateral portfolio investments which look through both roles, attributing the wealth held via investment funds to the underlying holders and linking securities issuance to the ultimate parent firms. Our new estimates show that the Euro Area is less financially integrated than it appears, both within the currency union and vis-a-vis the rest of the world. While official data suggests a sharp decline in portfolio home bias for Euro Area countries relative to other developed economies following the introduction of the euro, we demonstrate that this pattern only remains true for bond portfolios, while it is artificially generated by OOFC activities for equity portfolios. Further, using new administrative evidence on the identity of non-Euro Area investors in OOFC funds, we document that the bulk of the positions constituting missing wealth in international financial accounts are now accounted for by United Kingdom counterparts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32275,32275,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024
“Something Works” in U.S. Jails: Misconduct and Recidivism Effects of the IGNITE Program,"Marcella Alsan, Arkey M. Barnett, Peter Hull, Crystal Yang","A longstanding and influential view in U.S. correctional policy is that “nothing works” when it comes to rehabilitating incarcerated individuals. We revisit this hypothesis by studying an innovative law-enforcement-led program launched in the county jail of Flint, Michigan: Inmate Growth Naturally and Intentionally Through Education (IGNITE). We develop an instrumental variable approach to estimate the effects of IGNITE exposure, which leverages quasi-random court delays that cause individuals to spend more time in jail both before and after the program’s launch. Holding time in jail fixed, we find that one additional month of IGNITE exposure reduces within-jail misconduct by 49% and reduces three-month recidivism by 18%, with the recidivism effects growing over time. Surveys of staff and community members, along with administrative test score records and within-jail text messages, suggest that cultural change and improved literacy and numeracy scores are key contributing mechanisms.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32282,32282,24-Apr,NBER,4/1/2024
Weathering the Storm: Supply Chains and Climate Risk,"Juanma Castro-Vincenzi, Gaurav Khanna, Nicolas Morales and Nitya Pandalai-Nayar","We characterize how firms structure supply chains under climate risk. Using new data on the universe of firm-to-firm transactions from an Indian state, we show that firms diversify sourcing locations, and suppliers exposed to climate risk charge lower prices. Our event-study analysis finds that firms with suppliers in flood-affected districts experience a decline in inputs lasting two months, followed by a return to original suppliers. We develop a general equilibrium model of firm input sourcing under climate risk. Firms diversify identical inputs from suppliers across space, trading off the probability of a climate shock against higher input costs. We quantify the model using data on 271 Indian districts, showing real wages vary across space and are correlated with geography and productivity. Wages are inversely correlated with sourcing risk, giving rise to a cost minimization-resilience tradeoff. Supply chain diversification unambiguously reduces real wage volatility, but ambiguously affects their levels, as diversification may come with higher input costs. While diversification helps mitigate climate risk, it exacerbates the distributional effects of climate change by reducing wages in regions prone to more frequent shocks.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2024/wp_24-03,24-03,1-Apr-24,FED-RICHMOND,4/2/2024
Trade Risk and Food Security,Tasso Adamopoulos and Fernando Leibovici,"We study the role of international trade risk for food security, the patterns of production and trade across sectors, and its implications for policy. We document that food import dependence across countries is associated with higher food insecurity, particularly in low-income countries. We provide causal evidence on the role of trade risk for food security by exploiting the exogeneity of the Ukraine-Russia war as a major trade disruption limiting access to imports of critical food products. Using micro-level data from Ethiopia, we empirically show that districts relatively more exposed to food imports from the conflict countries experienced a significant increase in food insecurity by consuming fewer varieties of foods. Motivated by this evidence, we develop a multi-country multi-sector model of trade and structural change with stochastic trade costs to study the impact and policy implications of trade risk. In the model, importers operate subject to limited liability and trade off the production cost advantage against the risk of higher trade costs when sourcing goods internationally. We find that trade risk can threaten food security, with substantial quantitative effects on trade flows and the sectoral composition of economic activity. We study the desirability of trade policy and production subsidies in partially mitigating exposure to trade risk and diversifying domestic economic activity.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-004,2024-004B,24-Mar,FED-STLOUIS,4/2/2024
"Book Value Risk Management of Banks: Limited Hedging, HTM Accounting, and Rising Interest Rates","João Granja, Erica Xuewei Jiang, Gregor Matvos, Tomasz Piskorski, Amit Seru","In the face of rising interest rates in 2022, banks mitigated interest rate exposure of the accounting value of their assets but left the vast majority of their long-duration assets exposed to interest rate risk. Data from call reports and SEC filings shows that only 6% of U.S. banking assets used derivatives to hedge their interest rate risk, and even heavy users of derivatives left most assets unhedged. The banks most vulnerable to asset declines and solvency runs decreased existing hedges, focusing on short-term gains but risking further losses if rates rose. Instead of hedging the market value risk of bank asset declines, banks used accounting reclassification to diminish the impact of interest rate increases on book capital. Banks reclassified $1 trillion in securities as held-to-maturity (HTM) which insulated these assets book values from interest rate fluctuations. More vulnerable banks were more likely to reclassify. Extending Jiang et al.’s (2023) solvency bank run model, we show that capital regulation could address run risk by encouraging capital raising, but its effectiveness depends on the regulatory capital definitions and can by eroded by the use of HTM accounting. Including deposit franchise value in regulatory capital calculations without considering run risk could weaken capital regulation’s ability to prevent runs. Our findings have implications for regulatory capital accounting and risk management practices in the banking sector.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/book-value-risk-management-of-banks-limited-hedging-htm-accounting-and-rising-interest-rates/,2024-37,2-Apr-24,BFI,4/3/2024
Downward Nominal Rigidities and Bond Premia,"François Gourio, Phuong Ngo","We develop a parsimonious New Keynesian macro-finance model with downward nominal rigidities to understand secular and cyclical movements in Treasury bond premia. Downward nominal rigidities create state-dependence in output and inflation dynamics: a higher level of inflation makes prices more flexible, leading output and inflation to be more volatile, and bonds to become more risky. The model matches well the relation between the level of inflation and a number of salient macro-finance moments. Moreover, we show that empirically, inflation and output respond more strongly to productivity shocks when inflation is high, as predicted by the model.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-09,2024-09,24-Apr,FED-CHICAGO,4/3/2024
The Global Credit Cycle,Nina Boyarchenko and Leonardo Elias,"Do global credit conditions affect local credit and business cycles? Using a large cross-section of equity and corporate bond market returns around the world, we construct a novel global credit factor and a global risk factor that jointly price the international equity and bond cross-section. We uncover a global credit cycle in risky asset returns, which is distinct from the global risk cycle. We document that the global credit cycle in asset returns translates into a global credit cycle in credit quantities, with a tightening in global credit conditions predicting extreme capital flow episodes and declines in the stock of country-level private debt. Furthermore, global credit conditions predict the mean and left tail of real GDP growth outcomes at the country level. Thus, the global pricing of corporate credit is a fundamental factor in driving local credit conditions and real outcomes.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1094,1094,3/27/2024,FED-NEWYORK,4/3/2024
How Cyclical Is the User Cost of Labor?,Marianna Kudlyak,"In employment relationships, a wage is an installment payment on an implicit long-term agreement between a worker and a firm. The price of labor that impacts firm’s hiring decisions, instead, reflects the hiring wage as well as the impact of economic conditions at the time of hiring on future wages. Measured by the labor’s user cost, the price of labor is substantially more pro-cyclical than the new-hire wage or the average wage. The strong procyclicality of the price of labor calls for other forces for cyclical labor demand to explain employment fluctuations.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/04/how-cyclical-is-the-user-cost-of-labor,2024-10,4/2/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,4/3/2024
Paradoxes and Problems in the Causal Interpretation of Equilibrium Economics,Keshav Dogra,"Equilibrium assumptions posit relations between different people's beliefs and behavior without describing a process that causes these relations to hold. I show that because equilibrium models do not describe a causal process whereby one endogenous variable affects another, attempts to decompose the effects of shocks into “direct” and “indirect” effects can suggest misleading predictions about how these models work. Equilibrium assumptions also imply absurd paradoxes: history can determine future behavior without affecting any intervening state variables today; individuals can learn information that no one originally possesses by observing each other’s actions. This makes equilibrium models unreliable tools to study how economic systems coordinate activity and aggregate dispersed information. I describe how to construct non-equilibrium models that avoid these paradoxes and can be interpreted causally.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1093,1093,3/26/2024,FED-NEWYORK,4/3/2024
Miss-Allocation: The Value of Workplace Gender Composition and Occupational Segregation,Rachel Schuh,"I analyze the value workers ascribe to the gender composition of their workplace and the consequences of these valuations for occupational segregation, tipping, and welfare. To elicit these valuations, I survey 9,000 U.S. adults using a hypothetical job choice experiment. This reveals that on average women and men value gender diversity, but these average preferences mask substantial heterogeneity. Older female workers are more likely to value gender homophily. This suggests that gender norms and discrimination, which have declined over time, may help explain some women’s desire for homophily. Using these results, I estimate a structural model of occupation choice to assess the influence of gender composition preferences on gender sorting and welfare. I find that workers’ composition valuations are not large enough to create tipping points, but they do reduce female employment in male-dominated occupations substantially. Reducing segregation could improve welfare: making all occupations evenly gender balanced improves utility as much as a 0.4 percent wage increase for women and a 1 percent wage increase for men, on average.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1092,1092,3/25/2024,FED-NEWYORK,4/3/2024

Third, job seekers display a striking propensity to target new postings, with almost half of applications flowing to openings posted in the past 48 hours. Fourth, applications per posting are much too uneven to reflect random search, even within narrow market segments and job categories. Moreover, posted offer wages play no role in explaining the deviations from a random-search benchmark.

Consumption Dynamics and Welfare Under Non-Gaussian Earnings Risk,"Fatih Guvenen, Rocio Madera, and Serdar Ozkan","CORRECT ORDER OF AUTHORS: Fatih Guvenen, Serdar Ozkan, and Rocio Madera. The order of coauthors has been assigned randomly using AEA’s Author Randomization Tool.

Recent empirical studies document that the distribution of earnings changes displays substantial deviations from lognormality: in particular, earnings changes are negatively skewed with extremely high kurtosis (long and thick tails), and these non-Gaussian features vary substantially both over the life cycle and with the earnings level of individuals. Furthermore, earnings changes display nonlinear (asymmetric) mean reversion. In this paper, we embed a very rich “benchmark earnings process” that captures these non-Gaussian and nonlinear features into a lifecycle consumption-saving model and study its implications for consumption dynamics, consumption insurance, and welfare. We show four main results. First, the benchmark process essentially matches the empirical lifetime earnings inequality—a first-order proxy for consumption inequality—whereas the canonical Gaussian (persistent-plus-transitory) process understates it by a factor of five to ten. Second, the welfare cost of idiosyncratic risk implied by the benchmark process is between two-to-four times higher than the canonical Gaussian one. Third, the standard method in the literature for measuring the pass-through of income shocks to consumption—can significantly overstate the degree of consumption smoothing possible under non-Gaussian shocks. Fourth, the marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income (e.g., from a stimulus check) is higher under non-Gaussian earnings risk.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-007,2024-007A,24-Apr,FED-STLOUIS,4/4/2024

The Creativity Decline: Evidence from US Patents,Aakash Kalyani,"Economists have long struggled to understand why aggregate productivity growth has dropped in recent decades while the number of new patents filed has steadily increased. I offer an explanation for this puzzling divergence: the creativity embodied in US patents has dropped dramatically over time. To separate creative from derivative patents, I develop a novel, text-based measure of patent creativity: the share of technical terminology that did not appear in previous patents. I show that only creative and not derivative patents are associated with significant improvements in firm level productivity. Using the measure, I show that inventors on average file creative patents upon entry, and file derivative patents with more experience. I embed this life-cycle of creativity in a growth model with endogenous creation and imitation of technologies. In this model, falling population growth explains 27% of the observed decline in patent creativity, 30% of the slowdown in productivity growth, and 64% of the increase in patenting.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-008,2024-008A,24-Apr,FED-STLOUIS,4/4/2024
The Adoption of Non-Rival Inputs and Firm Scope,Xian Jiang and Hannah Rubinton,"Custom software is distinct from other types of capital in that it is non-rival---once a firm makes an investment in custom software, it can be used simultaneously across its many establishments. Using confidential US Census data, we document that while firms with more establishments are more likely to invest in custom software, they spend less on it as a share of total capital expenditure. We explain these empirical patterns by developing a model that incorporates the non-rivalry of custom software. In the model, firms choose whether to adopt custom software, the intensity of their investment, and their scope, balancing the cost of managing multiple establishments with the increasing returns to scope from the non-rivalrous custom software investment. Using the calibrated model, we assess the extent to which the decline in the rental rate of custom software over the past 40 years can account for a number of macroeconomic trends, including increases in firm scope and concentration.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-005,2024-005B,24-Mar,FED-STLOUIS,4/4/2024

We identify phrases associated with novel technologies using textual analysis of patents, job postings, and earnings calls, enabling us to identify four stylized facts on the diffusion of jobs relating to new technologies. First, the development of new technologies is geographically highly concentrated, more so even than overall patenting: 56% of the economically most impactful technologies come from just two U.S. locations, Silicon Valley and the Northeast Corridor. Second, as the technologies mature and the number of related jobs grows, hiring spreads geographically. But this process is very slow, taking around 50 years to disperse fully. Third, while initial hiring in new technologies is highly skill biased, over time the mean skill level in new positions declines, drawing in an increasing number of lower-skilled workers. Finally, the geographic spread of hiring is slowest for higher-skilled positions, with the locations where new technologies were pioneered remaining the focus for the technology’s high-skill jobs for decades.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-009,2024-009A,24-Apr,FED-STLOUIS,4/4/2024
As interest rates surge: flighty deposits and lending,"Giuseppe Cappelletti, David Marqués-Ibáñez, Alessio Reghezza, Carmelo Salleo","How a historic drop in bank deposits shapes banks’ loan supply? We exploit the effects of a large, and unexpected, increase in monetary policy rates to estimate the deposit channel of monetary policy using an extensive credit register that includes all bank-firm lending relationships in all euro area countries. We find that banks experiencing large deposit outflows reduce credit, but not the interest rate they charge, to the same borrower relative to other lenders. This credit restriction is stronger for fixed rate and longer maturity loans, but not for riskier borrowers. The effect is mostly driven by banks coming into the hiking period with a larger unhedged duration gap that renders borrowers of those banks more vulnerable to credit restrictions due to the deposit outflows as interest rates surge. We resort to the deposit beta as an instrument variable and a matched estimator that bear out the thrust of our results.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2923~e8621c033e.en.pdf?9ba6ffa838692629ea4e4ce07dd92031,2923,3-Apr-24,ECB,4/4/2024
On Commercial Construction Activity's Long and Variable Lags,"David Glancy, Robert J.

We construct a model with endogenous planning starts and abandonment that matches these facts. Endogenous abandonment make short-term building supply more elastic, as price shocks immediately affect the exercise of construction options rather than just planning starts.

The tail impact is particularly sizeable for asset purchases and swap lines. The effects last for up to one month, and are proportionally higher in a hypothetical joint QE action scenario.

Central bank profit distribution and recapitalisation,Jamie Long and Paul Fisher,"Central banks retain a portion of their net profits as reserves and distribute the remainder to their finance ministry, typically in the form of a dividend. Few central banks have a reciprocal arrangement in place for covering financial losses with a transfer of capital. This paper reports the findings of a survey of central bank profit distribution and recapitalisation arrangements across 70 jurisdictions and examines the range of features present, such as revaluation accounts and requirements for capital injections. The findings help establish the importance of a robust framework for managing central bank profit distribution and recapitalisation. The presence of such a framework should allow central banks to retain more of profits and access external resources when capital is low, and to function as an income generating asset for the government when capital is high, therefore ensuring both an appropriate use of public funds and the presence of a credible and financially independent central bank that stands ready to act when needed.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/central-bank-profit-distribution-and-recapitalisation,1069,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 ",BOE,4/6/2024
Monetary policy consequences of financial stability interventions: assessing the UK LDI crisis and the central bank policy response,Nicolò Bandera and Jacob Stevens,"We study the macroeconomic implications of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) in the context of the 2022 UK gilt crisis and estimate the monetary policy spillovers of financial stability interventions. We make three contributions. First, we develop the first DSGE model featuring liability driven investment (LDI) and pension funds. This novel framework in which LDI activity amplifies the movements in gilt prices allows us to replicate the UK gilt crisis, demonstrating a crucial mechanism through which NBFIs can amplify financial and economic distress. Second, we quantitatively estimate the monetary policy spillovers of the Bank of England financial stability asset purchases. We find that the asset purchases were successful in offsetting LDI-driven gilt market dysfunction. The temporary, targeted nature of these purchases was crucial in avoiding monetary spillovers. Third, we model two counterfactual instruments – an NBFI repo tool and a macroprudential liquidity buffer – and compare their effectiveness as well as monetary spillovers.

We then present novel stylized facts about Bitcoin cross-border flows and study their global and domestic drivers. Bitcoin cross-border flows respond differently than capital flows to traditional drivers of capital flows, and differences appear between on-chain and off-chain Bitcoin cross-border flows. Off-chain cross-border flows seem correlated with incentives to avoid capital flow restrictions.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/04/05/A-Primer-on-Bitcoin-Cross-Border-Flows-Measurement-and-Drivers-547429,2024-085,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 ",IMF,4/6/2024
Can Energy Subsidies Help Slay Inflation?,"Christopher J. Erceg, Marcin Kolasa, Jesper Lindé, Andrea Pescatori","Many countries have used energy subsidies to cushion the effects of high energy prices on households and firms. After documenting the transmission of oil supply shocks empirically in the United States and the Euro Area, we use a New Keynesian modeling framework to study the conditions under which these policies can curb inflation. We first consider a closed economy model to show that a consumer subsidy may be counterproductive, especially as an inflation-fighting tool, when applied globally or in a segmented market, at least under empirically plausible conditions about wage-setting. We find more scope for energy subsidies to reduce core inflation and stimulate demand if introduced by a small group of countries which collectively do not have much influence on global energy prices. However, the conditions under which consumer energy subsidies reduce inflation are still quite restrictive, and this type of policy may well be counterproductive if the resulting increase in external debt is high enough to trigger sizeable exchange rate depreciation. Such effects are more likely in emerging markets with shallow foreign exchange markets. If the primary goal of using fiscal measures in response to spikes in energy prices is to shield vulnerable households, then targeted transfers are much more efficient as they achieve their goals at lower fiscal cost and transmit less to core inflation.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/04/05/Can-Energy-Subsidies-Help-Slay-Inflation-547366,2024-081,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 ",IMF,4/6/2024
Changing Global Linkages: A New Cold War?,"Gita Gopinath, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Andrea Pescatori, Petia Topalova","Global linkages are changing amidst elevated geopolitical tensions and a surge in policies directed at increasing supply chain resilience and national security. Using granular bilateral data, this paper provides new evidence of trade and investment fragmentation along geopolitical lines since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and compares it to the historical experience of the early years of the Cold War. Gravity model estimates point to significant declines in trade and FDI flows between countries in geopolitically distant blocs since the onset of the war in Ukraine, relative to flows between countries in the same bloc (roughly 12% and 20%, respectively). While the extent of fragmentation is still relatively small and we do not know how longlasting it will be, the decoupling between the rival geopolitical blocs during the Cold War suggests it could worsen considerably should geopolitical tensions persist and trade restrictive policies intensify. Different from the early years of the Cold War, a set of nonaligned ‘connector’ countries are rapidly gaining importance and serving as a bridge between blocs. The emergence of connectors has likely brought resilience to global trade and activity, but does not necessarily increase diversification, strengthen supply chains, or lessen strategic dependence.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/04/05/Changing-Global-Linkages-A-New-Cold-War-547357,2024-076,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 ",IMF,4/6/2024
Designing a Progressive VAT,"Artur Swistak, Rita de la Feria","This paper presents a novel approach to addressing VAT regressivity, by proposing the adoption of a progressive VAT: a single-rate, broad-base, VAT, whereby tax paid on consumption is re-paid to lower income households in real-time, at the moment of purchase. Such a system can effectively eliminate regressivity, while minimizing the political economy, cash-flow, and welfare stigma obstacles that are often associated with standard welfare transfers used in modern VAT systems. It would also have other significant advantages, particularly in terms of compliance incentives.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/04/05/Designing-a-Progressive-VAT-546923,2024-078,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 ",IMF,4/6/2024
Financial Stability in a Higher-for-Longer Interest Rate Environment The Case of the Middle East and North Africa,"Adrian Alter, Bashar Hlayhel, Thomas Kroen, Thomas Piontek","This paper assesses the state and resilience of corporate and banking sectors in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in a “higher-for-longer” interest rate environment using granular micro data to conduct the first cross-country corporate and banking sector stress tests for the MENA region. The results suggest that corporate sector debt at risk may increase sizably from 12 to 30 percent of total corporate debt. Banking systems would be broadly resilient in an adverse scenario featuring higher interest rates, corporate sector stress, and rising liquidity pressures with Tier-1 capital ratios declining by 2.3 percentage points in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and 4.0 percentage points in non-GCC MENA countries.

How Vulnerable is Sub-Saharan Africa to Geoeconomic Fragmentation?,"Marijn A. Bolhuis, Hamza Mighri, Henry Rawlings, Ivanova Reyes, Qianqian Zhang","This paper studies the potential effects of geoeconomic fragmentation (GEF) in the sub-Saharan Africa region (SSA) through quantifying potential long-term economic costs. The paper considers two alternative GEF scenarios in which trade relations are fully or partially curtailed across world economies. Our quantification relies on a multi-country multi-sector general equilibrium model and takes a deep dive into the impact across SSA’s oil-rich, other resource-rich and non-resource-rich countries. The results are based on a detailed dataset including information for 136 tradable primary commodity and 24 manufacturing and services sectors in 145 countries—32 of which are in SSA.  We find that under GEF, SSA could experience long-term wellfare losses of approximately 4 percent of GDP, twice the losses of the rest of the world. This strong effect results from the large losses of other resource-rich and non-resource rich countries in SSA, given their high dependence on commodity trade. However, if the world experiences a less severe GEF-induced trade disruption—a strategic decoupling—SSA countries could derive minor gains from the re-shuffling of global market supply, specially in energy products.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/04/05/How-Vulnerable-is-Sub-Saharan-Africa-to-Geoeconomic-Fragmentation-546346,2024-083,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 ",IMF,4/6/2024
"This Is Going to Hurt: Weather Anomalies, Supply Chain Pressures and Inflation","Serhan Cevik, Gyowon Gwon","As climate change accelerates, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events are expected to worsen and have greater adverse consequences for ecosystems, physical infrastructure, and economic activity across the world. This paper investigates how weather anomalies affect global supply chains and inflation dynamics. Using monthly data for six large and well-diversified economies (China, the Euro area, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States) over the period 1997-2021, we implement a structural vector autoregressive model and document that weather anomalies could disrupt supply chains and subsequently lead to inflationary pressures. Our results—based on high-frequency data and robust to alternative estimation methodologies—show that these effects vary across countries, depending on the severity of weather shocks and vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. The impact of weather shocks on supply chains and inflation dynamics is likely to become more pronounced with accelerating climate change that can have non-linear effects. These findings have important policy implications. Central bankers should consider the impact of weather anomalies on supply chains and inflation dynamics to prevent entrenching second-round effects and de-anchoring of inflation expectations. More directly, however, governments can invest more for climate change adaptation to strengthen critical infrastructure and thereby minimize supply chain disruptions.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/04/05/This-Is-Going-to-Hurt-Weather-Anomalies-Supply-Chain-Pressures-and-Inflation-545462,2024-079,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 ",IMF,4/6/2024
Unveiling the Dance of Commodity Prices and the Global Financial Cycle,"Luciana Juvenal, Ivan Petrella","We examine the impact of commodity price changes on the business cycles and capital flows in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), distinguishing between their role as a source of shock and as a channel of transmission of global shocks. Our findings reveal that surges in export prices, triggered by commodity price shocks, boost domestic GDP, an effect further amplified by the endogenous decline of country spreads. However, the effects on capital flows appear muted. Shifts in U.S. monetary policy and global risk appetite drive the global financial cycle in EMDEs. Eased global credit conditions, attributed to looser U.S. monetary policy or lower global risk appetite, lead to a rise in export prices, higher output, a decrease in government borrowing costs, and stimulate greater capital flows. The endogenous response of export prices amplifies the output effects of a more accommodative U.S. monetary policy while country spreads magnify the impact of shifts in global risk appetite.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/04/05/Unveiling-the-Dance-of-Commodity-Prices-and-the-Global-Financial-Cycle-547371,2024-082,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 ",IMF,4/6/2024

Quantifying the Uncertainty of Imputed Demographic Disparity Estimates: The Dual-Bootstrap,"Benjamin Lu, Jia Wan, Derek Ouyang, Jacob Goldin, Daniel E. Ho","Measuring average differences in an outcome across racial or ethnic groups is a crucial first step for equity assessments, but researchers often lack access to data on individuals’ races and ethnicities to calculate them. A common solution is to impute the missing race or ethnicity labels using proxies, then use those imputations to estimate the disparity. Conventional standard errors mischaracterize the resulting estimate’s uncertainty because they treat the imputation model as given and fixed, instead of as an unknown object that must be estimated with uncertainty. We propose a dual-bootstrap approach that explicitly accounts for measurement uncertainty and thus enables more accurate statistical inference, which we demonstrate via simulation. In addition, we adapt our approach to the commonly used Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) imputation algorithm, where direct bootstrapping is infeasible because the underlying Census Bureau data are unavailable. In simulations, we find that measurement uncertainty is generally insignificant for BISG except in particular circumstances; bias, not variance, is likely the predominant source of error. We apply our method to quantify the uncertainty of prevalence estimates of common health conditions by race using data from the American Family Cohort.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32312,32312,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024

This study is the first to explore the effects of ENDS taxes on substance use. We find that a one-dollar increase in ENDS taxes (2019$) is associated with a 1-to-2 percentage point decline in teen marijuana use and a 0.8 percentage point reduction in adult marijuana use. This result is consistent with e-cigarettes and marijuana being economic complements. We find no evidence that ENDS taxes affect drug treatment admissions or consumption of illicit drugs other than marijuana such as cocaine, methamphetamine, or opioids over this sample period.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32302,32302,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024

We show empirically that the likelihood of being persistently financially constrained decreases with cognitive skills and increases with overconfidence thereon. Guided by this and other micro evidence, we add persistent heterogeneity in cognitive skills and overconfidence to an otherwise standard HANK model. Overconfidence proves to be the key innovation, driving households to spend instead of precautionary save and producing empirically realistic wealth distributions and hand-to-mouth shares and MPCs across the income distribution.

Does nothing stop a bullet like a job? The effects of income on crime,"Jens Ludwig, Kevin Schnepel","Do jobs and income-transfer programs affect crime? The answer depends on why one is asking the question, which shapes what one means by “crime.” Many studies focus on understanding why overall crime rates vary across people, places, and time; since 80% of all crimes are property offenses, that’s what this type of research typically explains. But if the goal is to understand what to do about the crime problem, the focus will instead be on serious violent crimes, which account for the majority of the social costs of crime. The best available evidence suggests that policies that reduce economic desperation reduce property crime (and hence overall crime rates) but have little systematic relationship to violent crime. The difference in impacts surely stems in large part from the fact that most violent crimes, including murder, are not crimes of profit but rather crimes of passion – including rage. Policies to alleviate material hardship, as important and useful as those are for improving people’s lives and well-being, are not by themselves sufficient to also substantially alleviate the burden of crime on society.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32297,32297,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024

However, our understanding of the impacts of climate change on wildfire smoke and health remains highly uncertain. We quantify the past and future mortality burden in the US due to wildfire smoke fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We construct an ensemble of statistical and machine learning models that link variation in climate to wildfire smoke PM2.5, and empirically estimate smoke PM2.5-mortality relationships using georeferenced data on all recorded deaths in the US from 2006 to 2019. We project that climate-driven increases in future smoke PM2.5 could result in 27,800 excess deaths per year by 2050 under a high warming scenario, a 76% increase relative to estimated 2011-2020 averages. Cumulative excess deaths from wildfire smoke PM2.5 could exceed 700,000 between 2025-2055. When monetized, climate-induced smoke deaths result in annual damages of $244 billion by mid-century, comparable to the estimated sum of all other damages in the US in prior analyses. Our research suggests that the health cost of climate-driven wildfire smoke could be among the most important and costly consequences of a warming climate in the US.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32307,32307,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024

Inequality and Racial Backlash: Evidence from the Reconstruction Era and the Freedmen’s Bureau,"Eric Chyn, Kareem Haggag, Bryan A.

We study this question by examining the effects of the Freedmen’s Bureau, an agency created after the U.S. Civil War to provide aid to former slaves and launch institutional reform in the South. We use new historical records and an event study approach to estimate impacts of the Bureau on political economy in the South. In the decade immediately after the war, counties with Bureau field offices had reduced vote shares for Democrats, the major political party that previously championed slavery and opposed Black civil rights during Reconstruction. In the longer-run, we find evidence of backlash in the form of higher Democratic vote shares and increases in several forms of racial violence, including lynchings and attacks against Black schools. This backlash extends through the twentieth century, when we find that counties that once had a Bureau field office have higher rates of second-wave and third-wave Ku Klux Klan activity and lower rates of intergenerational economic mobility. Overall, our results suggest that the initial impacts of the Freedmen’s Bureau stimulated countervailing responses by White majorities who sought to offset social progress of Black Americans.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32314,32314,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024

We use the analysis to provide a fresh perspective on the forces that drove global inflation downward over the past four decades.

Effects of Income on Infant Health: Evidence from the Expanded Child Tax Credit and Pandemic Stimulus Checks,"Wei Lyu, George Wehby, Robert Kaestner","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government issued stimulus checks and expanded the child tax credit. These pandemic payments varied by marital status and the number of children in the household and were substantial with some families receiving several thousand dollars. We exploit this plausibly exogenous variation in income to obtain estimates of the effect income on infant health. We measure the total amount of pandemic payments received during pregnancy, or the year before birth, and examine how this additional income affects birthweight, the incidence of low birth weight, gestational age and fetal growth. Data are from birth certificates and analyses are conducted separately by maternal marital status and education (less than high school or high school) to isolate only the variation in pandemic payments due to differences in the number of children (parity). Estimates indicate that these pandemic cash payments had no statistically significant, or clinically or economically meaningful effects on infant health. Overall, the findings suggest that income transfers during pregnancy will have little effect on socioeconomic disparities in infant health.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32310,32310,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024
Taxation of Capital: Capital Levies and Commitment,"Robert J. Barro, Varadarajan V. Chari","Chamley and Judd argued that optimal taxation dictates zero long-run tax rates on capital income, but Straub and Werning found that tax rates may be positive even in the steady state.  These models feature a “period-zero problem” in the underlying Ramsey formulation, which omits past commitments but includes future ones.  The period-zero policymaker then imposes capital levies on initial assets—directly or indirectly through positive tax rates on future asset income and non-constant tax rates on consumption.  Chari, Nicolini, and Teles add commitment by the period-zero policymaker to households’ initial wealth in utility units.  In this case, a nonzero capital levy may apply in period zero, future tax rates on asset income equal zero, and tax rates on consumption are constant.  Time-consistency fails if future policymakers are unconstrained but holds if commitments to initial wealth in utility units are strict enough each period to motivate each policymaker to choose zero direct capital levies.  In that case, a timeless perspective applies where period zero is not special, tax rates on asset income are always zero, and tax rates on consumption are constant.  Introduction of uncertainty generates state-contingent levies on assets and random-walk-like variations in consumption tax rates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32306,32306,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024
"Ideology, Incidence and the Political Economy of Fuel Taxes: Evidence from the California 2018 Proposition 6","Lucas Epstein, Erich Muehlegger","In 2018, California voters rejected Proposition 6, a ballot initiative that sought to repeal state gasoline taxes and vehicle fees enacted as part of the 2017 Road Repair and Accountability Act.  We study the relationship between support for the proposition, political ideology and the economic burdens imposed by the Act.  For every hundred dollars of annual per-household imposed costs, we estimate that support for the proposition rose by 3 - 9 percentage points.  Notably, we find that the relationship between voting and the economic burden of the policy is seven times stronger in the most conservative tracts relative to the most liberal tracts.  Since conservative areas in California and elsewhere tend to bear a higher burden from transportation and energy taxes than liberal areas, heterogeneity in the response to economic burdens has important implications for the popular support for environmental taxes and the ongoing policy debate about how to finance future road infrastructure.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32311,32311,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024
Why Do We Dislike Inflation?,Stefanie Stantcheva,"This paper provides new evidence on a long-standing question asked by Shiller (1997): Why do we dislike inflation? I conducted two surveys on representative samples of the US population to elicit people’s perceptions about the impacts of inflation and their reactions to it. The predominant reason for people’s aversion to inflation is the widespread belief that it diminishes their buying power, as neither personal nor general wage increases seem to match the pace of rising prices. As a result, respondents report having to make costly adjustments in their budgets and behaviors, especially among lower-income groups. Inflation also provokes stress, emotional responses, and a sense of inequity, as the wages of high-income individuals are perceived to grow more rapidly amidst inflation. Many respondents believe that firms have considerable discretion in setting wages, opting not to raise them in order to boost profits, rather than being compelled by market dynamics. The potential positive associations of inflation, such as with reduced unemployment or enhanced economic activity, are typically not recognized by respondents. Inflation ranks high in priority among various economic and social issues, with respondents blaming the government and businesses for it.

The Performance of Emerging Markets During The Fed’s Easing and Tightening Cycles: A Cross-Country Resilience Analysis,"Joshua Aizenman, Donghyun Park, Irfan A.

We study how macroeconomic and institutional conditions of an Emerging Market (EM) at the beginning of a cycle explain EM resilience during each cycle. More specifically, our baseline cross-sectional regressions examine how those conditions affect three measures of resilience, namely bilateral exchange rate against the USD, exchange rate market pressure, and country-specific Morgan Stanley Capital International index (MSCI). We then stack the five cross-sections to build a panel database to investigate potential asymmetry between tightening versus easing cycles. Our evidence indicates that macroeconomic and institutional variables are associated with EM performance, determinants of resilience differ during tightening versus easing cycles, and institutions matter more during difficult times. Our specific findings are largely consistent with economic intuition. For instance, we find that current account balance, international reserves, and inflation are all important determinants of EM resilience.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32303,32303,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024
Marginal Returns to Public Universities,Jack Mountjoy,"This paper studies the causal impacts of public universities on the outcomes of their marginally admitted students. I use administrative admission records spanning all 35 public universities in Texas, which collectively enroll 10 percent of American public university students, to systematically identify and employ decentralized cutoffs in SAT/ACT scores that generate discontinuities in admission and enrollment. The typical marginally admitted student completes an additional year of education in the four-year sector, is 12 percentage points more likely to earn a bachelor's degree, and eventually earns 5-10 percent more than their marginally rejected but otherwise identical counterpart. Marginally admitted students pay no additional tuition costs thanks to offsetting grant aid; cost-benefit calculations show internal rates of return of 19-23 percent for the marginal students themselves, 10-12 percent for society (which must pay for the additional education), and 3-4 percent for the government budget. Finally, I develop a method to disentangle separate effects for students on the extensive margin of the four-year sector versus those who would fall back to another four-year school if rejected. Substantially larger extensive margin effects drive the results.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32296,32296,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024
Location Sorting and Endogenous Amenities: Evidence from Amsterdam,"Milena Almagro, Tomás Domínguez-Iino","This paper shows the endogeneity of amenities plays a crucial role in determining the welfare distribution of a city’s residents. We quantify this mechanism by building a dynamic model of residential choice with heterogeneous households, where consumption amenities are the equilibrium outcome of a market for non-tradables. We estimate our model using Dutch microdata and leveraging variation in Amsterdam’s spatial distribution of tourists as a demand shifter, finding significant heterogeneity in residents’ preferences over amenities and in the supply responses of amenities to changes in demand composition. This two-way heterogeneity dictates the degree of horizontal differentiation across neighborhoods, residential sorting, and inequality. Finally, we show the distributional effects of mass tourism depend on this heterogeneity: following rent increases due to growing tourist demand for housing, younger residents—whose amenity preferences are closest to tourists—are compensated by amenities tilting in their favor, while the losses of older residents are amplified.298",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32304,32304,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024

We find that the optimal version of the game has increased game play equivalent to 43% of the winner-loser gap.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32295,32295,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024
Consumption Dynamics and Welfare Under Non-Gaussian Earnings Risk,"Fatih Guvenen, Serdar Ozkan, Rocio Madera","Recent empirical studies document that the distribution of earnings changes displays substantial deviations from lognormality: in particular, earnings changes are negatively skewed with extremely high kurtosis (long and thick tails), and these non-Gaussian features vary substantially both over the life cycle and with the earnings level of individuals. Furthermore, earnings changes display nonlinear (asymmetric) mean reversion. In this paper, we embed a very rich “benchmark earnings process” that captures these non-Gaussian and nonlinear features into a lifecycle consumption-saving model and study its implications for consumption dynamics, consumption insurance, and welfare. We show four main results. First, the benchmark process essentially matches the empirical lifetime earnings inequality—a first-order proxy for consumption inequality—whereas the canonical Gaussian (persistent-plus-transitory) process understates it by a factor of five to ten. Second, the welfare cost of idiosyncratic risk implied by the benchmark process is between two-to-four times higher than the canonical Gaussian one. Third, the standard method in the literature for measuring the pass-through of income shocks to consumption—can significantly overstate the degree of consumption smoothing possible under non-Gaussian shocks. Fourth, the marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income (e.g., from a stimulus check) is higher under non-Gaussian earnings risk.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32298,32298,24-Apr,NBER,4/8/2024

A Macroeconomic Model of Central Bank Digital Currency,"Pascal Paul, Mauricio Ulate, Jing Cynthia Wu","We develop a quantitative New Keynesian DSGE model to study the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC): government-backed digital money available to retail consumers. At the heart of our model are monopolistic banks with market power in deposit and loan markets. When a CBDC is introduced, households benefit from an expansion of liquidity services and higher deposit rates as bank deposit market power is curtailed. However, deposits also flow out of the banking system and bank lending contracts. We assess this welfare trade-off for a wide range of economies that differ in their level of interest rates. We find substantial welfare gains from introducing a CBDC with an optimal interest rate that can be approximated by a simple rule of thumb: the maximum between 0% and the policy rate minus 1%.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/04/macroeconomic-model-of-central-bank-digital-currency,2024-11,4/8/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,4/9/2024
Investor Attention to Bank Risk During the Spring 2023 Bank Run,"Natalia Fischl-Lanzoni, Martin Hiti, Nathan Kaplan, and Asani Sarkar","We examine how investors’ perception of bank balance sheet risk evolved before and during the March-April 2023 bank run. To do so, we estimate the covariance (“beta”) of bank excess stock returns with returns on factors constructed from long-short portfolios sorted on shares of uninsured deposits and unrealized losses on securities. We find that the market’s perception of bank risk shifted in both the time series and the cross-section. From January 2022 to February 2023, both factor betas were mostly insignificant, but after the bank run started, they became positive and significant for all banks on average. However, in the cross-section, only the factor betas of banks put on downgrade watch on March 13 were significant, consistent with our finding that this announcement was informative. When additional banks were downgraded in April, their factor betas also became significant, even though we find the April announcements to be noninformative for these banks. We suggest that investors with limited attention focused on the banks included in the April announcements to update their priors on balance sheet risk.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1095,1095,4/8/2024,FED-NEWYORK,4/9/2024

Administrative panel data that combines student transcripts with matched employer-employee records allow us to provide the first decomposition of premia into individual and firm-specific components. We find that both major and institutional premia are more strongly related to the firm-specific component of wages than the individual-specific component of wages.

A New Measure of Climate Transition Risk Based on Distance to a Global Emission Factor Frontier,"Benjamin N. Dennis, Talan B. İşcan","Targeted financing of transition to a ""net zero"" global economy entails climate transition risk. We propose a measure of transition risk at the country-sector dyad level composed of five tiers of transition risk based on two factors: i) the gap between a dyad's existing emission factor (EF) – a measure of the greenhouse gas intensity of output – and the global 'frontier' sectoral EF, and ii) a dyad's recent convergence towards the frontier EF. Dyads that are either close to the frontier or converging towards the frontier carry lower transition risk. Our measure, using 45 sectors across 66 countries, accounts for both direct greenhouse gas emissions as well as those that enter into production through complex supply chains as captured by intercountry, input-output tables, and can be applied at different levels of stringency to high-, middle-, and low-income economies. Our measure thus accounts for, and sheds light on, EF reductions through investment in lower emissions production techniques in own facilities as well as sourcing intermediate inputs with lower embodied emissions.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/a-new-measure-of-climate-transition-risk-based-on-distance-to-a-global-emission-factor-frontier.htm,2024-017,24-Apr,FED-BOARD,4/10/2024

Risk Perception and Loan Underwriting in Securitized Commercial Mortgages,"Simon Firestone, Nathan Godin, Akos Horvath, Jacob Sagi","We use model-implied volatility to proxy for property risk perceptions in the commercial real estate lending market. Although loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) unconditionally decreased following the Global Financial Crisis, LTVs conditioned on implied volatility and other theoretically motivated fundamental determinants of optimal leverage show no conclusive trend before or after the crisis. Taking reported property and loan attributes at face value, we find no clear pattern of unwarranted credit being extended to commercial real estate assets. We conclude that systematically higher LTV decisions pre-crisis would have primarily stemmed from risk misperceptions rather than imprudent practices. Our findings suggest that the aggregate LTV level should be interpreted as a proxy for lending standards only after controlling for aggregate risk perceptions, among a host of asset and lending market factors. Our findings also highlight the importance of measuring and tracking aggregate risk perceptions in informing regulators and policymakers.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/risk-perception-and-loan-underwriting-in-securitized-commercial-mortgages.htm,2024-019,24-Apr,FED-BOARD,4/11/2024
Does Nothing Stop a Bullet Like a Job? The Effects of Income on Crime,"Jens Ludwig, Kevin Schnepel","Do jobs and income-transfer programs affect crime? The answer depends on why one is asking the question, which shapes what one means by “crime.” Many studies focus on understanding why overall crime rates vary across people, places, and time; since 80% of all crimes are property offenses, that’s what this type of research typically explains. But if the goal is to understand what to do about the crime problem, the focus will instead be on serious violent crimes, which account for the majority of the social costs of crime. The best available evidence suggests that policies that reduce economic desperation reduce property crime (and hence overall crime rates) but have little systematic relationship to violent crime. The difference in impacts surely stems in large part from the fact that most violent crimes, including murder, are not crimes of profit but rather crimes of passion – including rage. Policies to alleviate material hardship, as important and useful as those are for improving people’s lives and well-being, are not by themselves sufficient to also substantially alleviate the burden of crime on society.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/does-nothing-stop-a-bullet-like-a-job-the-effects-of-income-on-crime/,2024-42,9-Apr-24,BFI,4/11/2024

"Inflation Expectations, Liquidity Premia and Global Spillovers in Japanese Bond Markets","Jens Christensen, Mark Spiegel","We provide market-based estimates of Japanese inflation expectations using an arbitrage-free dynamic term structure model of nominal and real yields that accounts for liquidity premia and the deflation protection afforded by Japanese inflation-indexed bonds, known as JGBi’s. We find that JGBi liquidity premia exhibit significant variation, and even switch sign. Properly accounting for them significantly lowers the estimated value of the indexed bonds’ deflation protection and affects inflation risk premium estimates. After liquidity adjustment, long-term Japanese inflation expectations have remained relatively stable at levels modestly exceeding one percent during the pandemic period. We then utilize our estimated liquidity measure to confirm the existence of statistically significant and economically meaningful spillovers to the JGBi market from global bond market illiquidity, as proxied by periods of low U.S. Treasury market depth.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/04/inflation-expectations-liquidity-premia-and-global-spillovers-in-japanese-bond-markets,2024-12,4/11/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,4/12/2024
Income Differences and Health Disparities: Roles of Preventive vs. Curative Medicine,Serdar Ozkan,"Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) I find that early in life the rich spend significantly more on health care, whereas from middle to very old age the poor outspend the rich by 25% in the US. Furthermore, while low-income individuals are less likely to incur medical expenses, they are more prone to experiencing extreme expenses when they do seek care. To account for these facts, I develop and estimate a life-cycle model of two types of health capital: physical and preventive. Physical health capital determines survival probabilities, whereas preventive health capital governs the distribution of shocks to physical health capital, thereby controlling life expectancy. Moreover, I incorporate key features of the US health care system, including private and public health insurance. Because of their lower marginal utility of consumption, the rich spend more on preventive care, resulting in milder health shocks (and lower curative medical expenditures) in old age compared to the poor. Notably, public insurance, which by design covers large expenditures, amplifies these differences by hampering the poor's incentives to invest in preventive health. Therefore, the model also implies a widening life expectancy gap between income groups in response to rising inequality. Policy experiments suggest that expanding health insurance coverage and subsidizing preventive care to encourage health care use by the poor early in life can generate substantial welfare gains, even when accounting for the higher taxes required to finance them.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-025,2023-025C,24-Apr,FED-STLOUIS,4/12/2024
Is home bias biased?

We instead propose a regime-robust test of FIRE and apply it to a medium-scale New Keynesian model with monetary policy regime shifts that is estimated on US data.

A new measure of firm-level competition: an application to euro area banks,"Michiel van Leuvensteijn, Ivan Huljak, Gabe de Bondt","This paper extends Boone (2008) by introducing a competition measure at the individual firm level rather than for an entire market segment. It is based on the elasticity between profits and efficiency and called marginal relative profitability (MRP). Its intuition is that when a small change in efficiency derived from marginal costs can cause a large change in profits, a firm exercises pressure on its peers and gains profits. The MRP is embedded in the theoretical framework of Boone and measures competition vis-à-vis other market participants. We apply this extended Boone indicator to individual bank-level competition in the loan market in the four largest euro area countries and Austria. The MRP distribution is skewed to the left and many banks have a MRP below one, indicating that those banks have little incentive to enhance their efficiency to increase their profits. The MRP approach is shown to be a powerful tool to test the efficient-structure, structure-conduct performance, and ‘quiet life’ hypotheses and to detect comparatively weak non-competitive banks. Our new measure of firm-level competition enriches and complements other competition measures and provides a promising starting point for future market power analyses.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2925~3a392b240a.en.pdf?da643173b3b48c18df4e73b7256636aa,2925,12-Apr-24,ECB,4/12/2024

The Adoption of Non-Rival Inputs and Firm Scope,Xian Jiang and Hannah Rubinton,"Custom software is distinct from other types of capital in that it is non-rival---once a firm makes an investment in custom software, it can be used simultaneously across its many establishments. Using confidential US Census data, we document that while firms with more establishments are more likely to invest in custom software, they spend less on it as a share of total capital expenditure. We explain these empirical patterns by developing a model that incorporates the non-rivalry of custom software. In the model, firms choose whether to adopt custom software, the intensity of their investment, and their scope, balancing the cost of managing multiple establishments with the increasing returns to scope from the non-rivalrous custom software investment. Using the calibrated model, we assess the extent to which the decline in the rental rate of custom software over the past 40 years can account for a number of macroeconomic trends, including increases in firm scope and concentration.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-005,2024-005C,24-Apr,FED-STLOUIS,4/13/2024
Downward Price Rigidities and Inflationary Relative Demand Shocks,"Dennis Bonam, Bart Hobijn","We show that a negative relative demand shock in a sector with downwardly rigid prices, like the service sector, can generate substantial inflation. Such a shock induces an equilibrium decline in the relative price of services. If price adjustment costs are non-existent or symmetric, then this takes place through a simultaneous decline in services prices and increase in goods prices, resulting in, on net, little inflation. If prices in the services sector are downwardly rigid, however, this takes place mostly through an increase in goods prices, resulting in inflation. To illustrate the relevance of this mechanism in practice we provide evidence on the downward rigidity of person-to-person service prices during the Covid pandemic of 2020-2021. We then introduce downward price rigidities in a multisector New-Keynesian model and show how they can result in inflationary relative demand shocks.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-11,2024-11,24-Apr,FED-CHICAGO,4/13/2024

Where Do Banks End and NBFIs Begin?,"Viral V. Acharya, Nicola Cetorelli, Bruce Tuckman","In recent years, assets of non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) have grown significantly relative to those of banks. These two sectors are commonly viewed either as operating in parallel, performing different activities, or as substitutes, performing substantially similar activities, with banks inside and NBFIs outside the perimeter of banking regulation. We argue instead that NBFI and bank businesses and risks are so interwoven that they are better described as having transformed over time rather than as having migrated from banks to NBFIs. These transformations are at least in part a response to regulation and are such that banks remain special as both routine and emergency liquidity providers to NBFIs. We support this perspective as follows: (i) The new and enhanced financial accounts data for the United States (“From Whom to Whom”) show that banks and NBFIs finance each other, with NBFIs especially dependent on banks; (ii) Case studies and regulatory data show that banks remain exposed to credit and funding risks, which at first glance seem to have moved to NBFIs, and also to contingent liquidity risk from the provision of credit lines to NBFIs; and (iii) Empirical work confirms bank-NBFI linkages through the correlation of their abnormal equity returns and market-based measures of systemic risk. We discuss some potential regulatory responses, including treating the two sectors holistically; recognizing the implications for risk propagation and amplification; and exploring new ways to internalize the costs of systemic risk.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32316,32316,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024

The Dominant Role of Expectations and Broad-Based Supply Shocks in Driving Inflation,"Paul Beaudry, Chenyu Hou, Franck Portier","The object of this paper is to assess the role of supply shocks, labour market tightness and expectation formation in explaining bouts of inflation.  We begin by showing that a quasi-flat Phillips curve,  which was popular prior to the pandemic, still fits the post-2020 US data well and that  changes in short term inflation expectations induced by supply shocks likely played a major role in the recent inflation episode.  We then document features of  the joint dynamics of inflation and inflation expectations. Given the difficulty of reproducing these dynamics under rational expectations, we propose and evaluate a model with imperfect information and bounded rationality.  In our model,  agents see sectoral inflations as being driven by a component common to all the sectors of the economy and by sector-specific shocks. When supply shocks affect many  sectors (what we refer to as a broad-based supply shock), agents infer that the common component of inflation has increased, which drive persistent inflation dynamics through their effect of expectations.  We show that departure from full rationality is minor, but that it is enough for broad-based supply shocks to be amplified and propagated over time in a manner needed to explain the data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32322,32322,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Recovering Overlooked Information in Categorical Variables with LLMs: An Application to Labor Market Mismatch,"Yi Chen, Hanming Fang, Yi Zhao, Zibo Zhao","Categorical variables have no intrinsic ordering, and researchers often adopt a fixed-effect (FE) approach in empirical analysis. However, this approach has two significant limitations: it overlooks textual labels associated with the categorical variables; and it produces unstable results when there are only limited observations in a category. In this paper, we propose a novel method that utilizes recent advances in large language models (LLMs) to recover overlooked information in categorical variables. We apply this method to investigate labor market mismatch. Specifically, we task LLMs with simulating the role of a human resources specialist to assess the suitability of an applicant with specific characteristics for a given job. Our main findings can be summarized in three parts. First, using comprehensive administrative data from an online job posting platform, we show that our new match quality measure is positively correlated with several traditional measures in the literature, and at the same time, we highlight the LLM's capability to provide additional information conditional on the traditional measures. Second, we demonstrate the broad applicability of the new method with a survey data containing significantly less information than the administrative data, which makes it impossible to compute most of the traditional match quality measures. Our LLM measure successfully replicates most of the salient patterns observed in a hard-to-access administrative dataset using easily accessible survey data. Third, we investigate the gender gap in match quality and explore whether there exists gender stereotypes in the hiring process. We simulate an audit study, examining whether revealing gender information to LLMs influences their assessment. We show that when gender information is disclosed to the GPT, the model deems females better suited for traditionally female-dominated roles.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32327,32327,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024

AI use is higher in large firms but the relationship between AI use and firm size is non-monotonic. In contrast, AI use is higher in young firms although, on an employment-weighted basis, is U-shaped in firm age. Common uses of AI include marketing automation, virtual agents, and data/text analytics. AI users often utilize AI to substitute for worker tasks and equipment/software, but few report reductions in employment due to AI use. Many firms undergo organizational changes to accommodate AI, particularly by training staff, developing new workflows, and purchasing cloud services/storage. AI users also exhibit better overall performance and higher incidence of employment expansion compared to other businesses. The most common reason for non-adoption is the inapplicability of AI to the business.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32319,32319,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Bank Failures and Economic Activity: Evidence from the Progressive Era,"Gary Richardson, Marco Del Angel, Michael Gou","During the Progressive Era (1900-29), economic growth was rapid but volatile. Boom and busts witnessed the formation and failure of tens of thousands of firms and thousands of banks. This essay uses new data and methods to identify causal links between failures of banks and bankruptcies of firms. Our analysis indicates that bank failures triggered bankruptcies of firms that depended upon banks for ongoing access to commercial credit. Firms that did not depend upon banks for credit did not fail in appreciably larger numbers after banks failed or during financial panics.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32345,32345,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
The Global Life-Cycle Optimizer – Analyzing Fiscal Policy's Potential to Dramatically Distort Labor Supply and Saving,"Johannes Brumm, Laurence J. Kotlikoff, Christopher Krause","Fiscal policy in the U.S. and other countries renders intertemporal budgets non-differentiable, nonconvex, and discontinuous. Consequently, assessing work and saving responses to policy requires global optimization. This paper develops the Global Life-Cycle Optimizer (GLO), a stochastic pattern-search algorithm. The GLO robustly, precisely, and quickly locates global optima in highly complex fiscal settings. We use the GLO to study how a stylized U.S. fiscal system distorts workers’ labor supply and saving assuming standard preferences. The system incorporates kinks from federal personal income tax brackets, Social Security’s FICA tax, and a notch from the provision of basic income below a threshold. The GLO reproduces theoretically predicted earnings bunching and flipping over a remarkably wide range of wage rates. Saving distortions can be equally dramatic. Associated excess burdens range from substantial to massive. Restricting labor supply to full-or part-time work can eliminate flipping when it’s optimal and produce flipping when it’s suboptimal. Joint filing can significantly reduce the earnings of lower-wage spouses relative to that of higher-wage spouses. The GLO can be applied to assess a country’s or state’s full set of work and saving disincentives. Consequently, it can facilitate analyses of structural labor supply and tax reform.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32335,32335,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Global Transmission of FED Hikes: The Role of Policy Credibility and Balance Sheets,"Ṣebnem Kalemli-Özcan, Filiz D. Unsal","Contrary to historical episodes, the 2022–2023 tightening of US monetary policy has not yet triggered financial crisis in emerging markets. Why is this time different? To answer this question, we analyze the current situation through the lens of historical evidence. In emerging markets, the financial channel–based transmission of US policy historically led to more adverse outcomes compared to advanced economies, where the trade channel fails to smooth out these negative effects. When the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, global investors tend to shed risky assets in response to the tightening global financial conditions, affecting emerging markets more severely due to their lower credit ratings and higher risk profiles. This time around, the escape from emerging market assets and the increase in risk spreads have been limited. We document that the historical experience of higher risk spreads and capital outflows can be largely explained by the lack of credible monetary policies and dollar-denominated debt. The improvement in monetary policy frameworks combined with reduced levels of dollar-denominated debt have helped emerging markets weather the recent Federal Reserve hikes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32329,32329,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
The Declining Mental Health Of The Young And The Global Disappearance Of The Hump Shape In Age In Unhappiness,"David G. Blanchflower, Alex Bryson, Xiaowei Xu","Across many studies subjective well-being follows a U-shape in age, declining until people reach middle-age, only to rebound subsequently.  Ill-being follows a mirror-imaged hump-shape.  But this empirical regularity has been replaced by a monotonic decrease in illbeing by age.  The reason for the change is the deterioration in young people’s mental health both absolutely and relative to older people.  We reconsider evidence for this fundamental change in the link between illbeing and age with micro data for the United States and the United Kingdom.  Beginning around 2011 there is a monotonic and declining cross-sectional association between well-being and age. In the UK the recent COVID pandemic exacerbated the trends by impacting most heavily on the wellbeing of the young, but this was not the case in the United States. We replicate the decrease in illbeing by age across 34 countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, using five ill-being metrics for the period 2020-2024 and confirm the findings.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32337,32337,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
After the Storm: How Emergency Liquidity Helps Small Businesses Following Natural Disasters,"Benjamin L. Collier, Sabrina T. Howell, Lea Rendell","Does emergency credit prevent long-term financial distress? We study the causal effects of government-provided recovery loans to small businesses following natural disasters. The rapid financial injection might enable viable firms to survive and grow or might hobble precarious firms with more risk and interest obligations. We show that the loans reduce exit and bankruptcy, increase employment and revenue, unlock private credit, and reduce delinquency. These effects, especially the crowding-in of private credit, appear to reflect resolving uncertainty about repair. We do not find capital reallocation away from neighboring firms and see some evidence of positive spillovers on local entry.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32326,32326,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
"Monetary Policy, Segmentation, and the Term Structure","Rohan Kekre, Moritz Lenel, Federico Mainardi","We develop a segmented markets model which rationalizes the effects of monetary policy on the term structure of interest rates.  When arbitrageurs’ portfolio features positive duration, an unexpected rise in the short rate lowers their wealth and raises term premia.  A calibration to the U.S. economy accounts for the transmission of monetary shocks to long rates.  We discuss the additional implications of our framework for state-dependence in policy transmission, the volatility and slope of the yield curve, and trends in term premia accompanying trends in the natural rate.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32324,32324,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Social Movements and Public Opinion in the United States,"Amory Gethin, Vincent Pons","Recent social movements stand out by their spontaneous nature and lack of stable leadership, raising doubts on their ability to generate political change. This article provides systematic evidence on the effects of protests on public opinion and political attitudes. Drawing on a database covering the quasi-universe of protests held in the United States, we identify 14 social movements that took place from 2017 to 2022, covering topics related to environmental protection, gender equality, gun control, immigration, national and international politics, and racial issues. We use Twitter data, Google search volumes, and high-frequency surveys to track the evolution of online interest, policy views, and vote intentions before and after the outset of each movement. Combining national-level event studies with difference-in-differences designs exploiting variation in local protest intensity, we find that protests generate substantial internet activity but have limited effects on political attitudes. Except for the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd, which shifted views on racial discrimination and increased votes for the Democrats, we estimate precise null effects of protests on public opinion and electoral behavior.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32342,32342,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
How You Pay Drives What You Choose: Health Savings Accounts versus Cash in Health Insurance Plan Choice,"Jonathan Gruber, Mengyun M. Lin, Haoming Liu, Junjian Yi","A marked feature of health insurance plan choice is inconsistent choices through the overweighting of premiums relative to out-of-pocket spending. We show that this source of inconsistency disappears when both types of spending come from the same source of designated funds. We focus on the MediSave program in Singapore, whereby residents can pay their health insurance premiums with cash or MediSave funds, but are subject to limits that vary by age and over time. By exploiting variations in those limits, we consistently find that when individuals are able to pay their health insurance premiums with MediSave funds, they are less price sensitive and more willing to enroll in more generous plans—which results in lower spending levels and variance, and lower adverse selection in the market. The results suggest a strong role for mental accounting in insurance decisions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32331,32331,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Countries for Old Men: An Analysis of the Age Pay Gap,"Nicola Bianchi, Matteo Paradisi","This study investigates the growing wage disparity between older and younger workers in high-income countries. We propose a conceptual framework of the labor market in which firms cannot change the contracts of older employees and cannot freely add higher-ranked positions to their organizations. In this model, a larger supply of older workers and declining economic growth restrict younger workers’ access to higher-paying roles and widen the age pay gap in favor of older workers. Drawing on extensive administrative and survey data, we document that the characteristics of these negative spillovers on younger workers’ careers align with the model’s predictions. As older workers enjoy more successful careers, younger workers become less likely to hold higher-ranked jobs and fall toward the bottom of the wage distribution. The pay gap between younger and older workers increases more in slower-growing, older, and larger firms and in firms with higher mean wages, where these negative spillovers on younger workers are larger in magnitude. Moreover, younger employees become less likely to work for higher-paying firms, whose share of older workers disproportionately increases over time. Finally, we show that alternative explanations for these findings receive little empirical support.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32340,32340,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Smoke from Factory Chimneys: The Applied Economics of Air Pollution in the Progressive Era,"H. Spencer Banzhaf, Randall Walsh","Like today, one hundred years ago air pollution was a matter of grave concern in the world's most polluted cities.  In the wake of its famous 1908-9 social survey, the City of Pittsburgh commissioned an ""Economic Survey of Pittsburgh"" from John T. Holdsworth, a prominent institutional economist at the University of Pittsburgh.  Although wide ranging, the report opened by stating that ""The first fundamental need in Pittsburgh is the eradication of smoke.""  This report was followed by a series of Smoke Investigations, in which, astonishingly, jars were placed around the city and the ash weighed monthly.  In one application, Holdsworth's assistant, John J. O'Connor, estimated the economic costs from smoke.  Arguably the first damage-cost study, O'Connor's work challenges our understanding of what counts as ""economic"" in the progressive era.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32328,32328,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Noisy Experts? Discretion in Regulation,"Sumit Agarwal, Bernardo C. Morais, Amit Seru, Kelly Shue","While reliance on human discretion is a pervasive feature of institutional design, human discretion can also introduce costly noise (Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein 2021). We evaluate the consequences, determinants, and trade-offs associated with discretion in high-stake decisions assessing bank safety and soundness. Using detailed data on the supervisory ratings of US banks, we find that professional bank examiners exercise significant personal discretion—their decisions deviate substantially from algorithmic benchmarks and can be predicted by examiner identities, holding bank fundamentals constant. Examiner discretion has a large and persistent causal impact on future bank capitalization and supply of credit, leading to volatility and uncertainty in bank outcomes, and a conservative anticipatory response by banks. We identify a novel source of noise: weights assigned to specific issues. Disagreement in ratings across examiners can be attributed to high average weight (50%) assigned to subjective assessment of banks’ management quality, as well as heterogeneity in weights attached to more objective issues such as capital adequacy. Replacing human discretion with a simple algorithm leads to worse predictions of bank health, while moderate limits on discretion can translate to more informative and less noisy predictions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32344,32344,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Theory-Driven Entrepreneurial Search,"Ankur Chavda, Joshua S. Gans, Scott Stern","How should theory-based entrepreneurs search for strategies to implement their ideas? The theory-based view of strategy posits that decision-makers hold theories about their environment premised on beliefs that should be actively tested. This causal framework, which underlies the theory-based view, also has implications for entrepreneurial search: the process by which entrepreneurs uncover strategies to implement their ideas. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian model where entrepreneurs update their beliefs as they conduct entrepreneurial search. We find several optimal behaviors for theory-based entrepreneurs such as reverting to a previous strategy after finding a relatively poor strategy and continuing to search after finding a relatively good strategy, which are missing when entrepreneurs lack such a theory-based approach. As these predictions align with examples of successful entrepreneurs, our findings both provide a method to empirically identify skilled entrepreneurs and demonstrate the usefulness of applying the theory-based view to entrepreneurial behavior more generally.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32318,32318,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
To Pay or Autopay? Fintech Innovation and Credit Card Payments,Jialan Wang,"Digital technologies and fintech firms have rapidly reshaped the consumer financial landscape in recent years, and have the potential to help consumers make better decisions and improve their financial health. Existing technologies such as autopay are also experiencing increased takeup, a trend that could be accelerated by innovations such as open banking. I examine the extent to which autopay affects payment behavior for customers of a credit card serviced by a fintech company. Using sharp changes in the company's practices in a regression discontinuity design, I find that a small nudge accounts for half of all autopay enrollment during the sample period, and that enrollment at account opening is persistent. Autopay increases the likelihood of making the minimum payment by 20 to 29pp, more than doubling the baseline rate. The results show that seemingly minor technological defaults can have economically large effects on consumer credit outcomes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32332,32332,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Interdependent Values in Matching Markets: Evidence from Medical School Programs in Denmark,"Benjamin Friedrich, Martin B. Hackmann, Adam Kapor, Sofia J. Moroni, Anne Brink Nandrup","This paper presents the first empirical evidence of interdependent values and strategic responses by market participants in a two-sided matching market. We consider the market for medical school programs in Denmark, which uses a centralized assignment mechanism. Leveraging unique administrative data and an information experiment, we show that students and rival programs hold payoff-relevant information that each program could use to admit students with higher persistence rates. Programs respond to these two sources of interdependent values, student self-selection and interdependent program values, by exhibiting ”home bias” towards local applicants. We construct and estimate a novel equilibrium model reflecting this evidence, and find that fully sharing information could significantly increase student persistence and program payoffs, but enabling students to communicate first preferences would leave outcomes unchanged. An alternative model assuming independent private values contradicts the empirical evidence, highlighting the importance of accounting for interdependent values in understanding and designing matching markets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32325,32325,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Quantitative Tightening Around the Globe: What Have We Learned?,"Wenxin Du, Kristin Forbes, Matthew N. Luzzetti","This paper uses the recent cross-country experience with quantitative tightening (QT) to assess the impact of shrinking central bank balance sheets. We analyze the experience in seven advanced economies (Australia, Canada, Euro area, New Zealand, Sweden, UK and US)—documenting different strategies and the substantive reduction in central bank balance sheets that has already occurred. Then we assess the macroeconomic and financial impact of QT announcements on yields and a range of other market prices. QT announcements increase government bond yields, steepening the yield curve and potentially signaling a greater commitment to raising policy interest rates, but have more limited effects on most other financial market indicators. Active QT has a larger impact than passive QT, particularly on longer maturities. The implementation of QT has been associated with a modest rise in overnight funding spreads and a decline in the “convenience yield” of government bonds, but QT transactions did not significantly affect the pricing and market liquidity of government debt securities. Finally, we evaluate who buys assets when central banks unwind balance sheets, an issue which will become increasingly important if central banks continue to reduce their security holdings while government debt issuance remains elevated. We find that increased demand by domestic nonbanks has largely compensated for reduced bond holdings by central banks. This series of cross-country results suggests that QT has had more of an impact than “paint drying”, but far less than simply reversing the effects of the quantitative easing programs launched during periods of market stress. Looking ahead, although QT has been smooth to date, frictions could increase in the future so that QT quickly evolves into more like watching “water boil”.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32321,32321,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Heterogeneity and Endogenous Compliance: Implications for Scaling Class Size Interventions,"Karun Adusumilli, Francesco Agostinelli, Emilio Borghesan","This paper examines the scalability of the results from the Tennessee Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) Project, a prominent educational experiment. We explore how the misalignment between the experimental design and the econometric model affects researchers' ability to learn about the intervention's scalability. We document heterogeneity in compliance with class-size reduction that is more extensive than previously acknowledged and discuss its consequences for the evaluation of the experiment. Guided by this finding, we implement a new econometric framework incorporating heterogeneous treatment effects and endogenous class size determination. We find that the effect of class size on test scores differs considerably across schools, with only a small fraction of schools having significant benefits from reduced class sizes. We discuss the challenges this poses for the intervention's scalability and conclude by analyzing targeted class-size interventions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32338,32338,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
Religious Worship Attendance in America: Evidence from Cellphone Data,Devin G. Pope,"Religious worship is integral to the lives of millions of Americans. In this paper, I provide a descriptive analysis of religious worship attendance using geodata from smartphones for over 2 million Americans in 2019. I establish several key findings. First, 73% of people step into a religious place of worship at least once during the year on the primary day of worship (e.g. Sundays for most Christian churches). However, only 5% of Americans attend services “weekly”, far fewer than the ~22% who report to do so in surveys. The number of occasional vs. frequent attenders varies substantially by religion. I estimate that approximately 45M Americans attend worship services in a typical week of the year, but with large changes around Holidays (e.g. Easter). I document how start times, duration of attendance, and average household income all differ meaningfully across religious traditions. The intensity of religious observance correlates with a host of other activities. For example, relative to non-attenders and infrequent attenders, frequent religious attenders are less likely to go to strip clubs, liquor stores, and casinos. While cell phone data has limitations, this paper provides a unique way of understanding worship attendance and its correlates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32334,32334,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024
"Homelessness and the Persistence of Deprivation: Income, Employment, and Safety Net Participation","Bruce D. Meyer, Angela Wyse, Gillian Meyer, Alexa Grunwaldt, Derek Wu","Homelessness is arguably the most extreme hardship associated with poverty in the United States, yet people experiencing homelessness are excluded from official poverty statistics and much of the extreme poverty literature. This paper provides the most detailed and accurate portrait to date of the level and persistence of material disadvantage faced by this population, including the first national estimates of income, employment, and safety net participation based on administrative data. Starting from the first large and nationally representative sample of adults recorded as sheltered and unsheltered homeless taken from the 2010 Census, we link restricted-use longitudinal tax records and administrative data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicare, Medicaid, Disability Insurance (DI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), veterans’ benefits, housing assistance, and mortality. Nearly half of these adults had formal employment in the year they were observed as homeless, and nearly all either worked or were reached by at least one safety net program. Nevertheless, their incomes remained low for the decade surrounding an observed period of homelessness, suggesting that homelessness tends to arise in the context of long-term, severe deprivation rather than large and sudden losses of income. People appear to experience homelessness because they are very poor despite being connected to the labor market and safety net, with low permanent incomes leaving them vulnerable to the loss of housing when met with even modest disruptions to life circumstances.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32323,32323,24-Apr,NBER,4/15/2024

With only fundamental defaults, we show that the competitive equilibrium is constrained efficient. However, when banks are vulnerable to runs, banks’ leverage decisions are not ex-ante optimal: individual banks do not internalize that higher leverage makes other banks more vulnerable.

Nothing for Something: Marketing Cancer Drugs to Physicians Increases Prescribing Without Improving Mortality,"Colleen Carey, Michael Daly, Jing Li","Physicians commonly receive marketing-related transfers from drug firms.  We examine the impact of these relationships on the prescribing of physician-administered cancer drugs in Medicare.  We find that prescribing of the associated drug increases 4\% in the twelve months after a payment is received, with the increase beginning sharply in the month of payment and fading out within a year.  A marketing payment also leads physicians to begin treating cancer patients with lower expected mortality.

We develop a quantitative spatial model, in which heterogeneous groups of individuals endogenously sort across locations in response to differences in natural advantages, wartime destruction and neighborhood effects.

We find, first, that posting durations are quite short, often only two or three days, with a median of seven days. Second, labor market tightness has tiny effects on posting durations. Third, job seekers display a striking propensity to target new postings, with almost half of applications flowing to openings posted in the past 48 hours. Fourth, applications per posting are much too uneven to reflect random search, even within narrow market segments and job categories. Moreover, posted offer wages play no role in explaining the deviations from a random-search benchmark. Fifth, intermediaries play a huge role on both sides of the platform: Recruitment and staffing firms account for two-thirds of all postings and attract most of the applications.

The Impact of Green Investors on Stock Prices,"Gong Cheng, Eric Jondeau, Benoit Mojon, Dimitri Vayanos","We study the impact of green investors on stock prices in a dynamic equilibrium model where investors are green, passive or active. Green investors track an index that progressively excludes the stocks of the brownest firms; passive investors hold a value-weighted index of all stocks; and active investors hold a mean-variance efficient portfolio of all stocks. Contrary to the literature, we find large drops in the stock prices of the brownest firms and moderate increases for greener firms. These effects occur primarily upon the announcement of the green index's formation and continue during the exclusion phase.

We perform three experiments: (i) an increase of total capital requirements; (ii) an introduction of a loan-to-income (LTI) cap on mortgages to owner-occupiers; and (iii) a joint introduction of both experiments at the same time. Our results suggest that tightening capital requirements leads to a sharp decrease in commercial and mortgage lending, and housing transactions. When the LTI cap is in place, house prices fall sharply relative to income, and the homeownership rate decreases. When both policy instruments are combined, we find that housing transactions and prices drop.

Using a novel arbitrage-free dynamic term structure model of nominal and real bond prices that accounts for bond-specific safety premia, we find that Sveriges Riksbank’s bond purchases raised inflation and short-rate expectations, lowered nominal and real term premia and inflation risk premia, and increased nominal bond safety premia, suggestive of signaling, portfolio rebalance, and safe asset scarcity effects. Furthermore, we document spillover effects of ECB’s QE programs on Swedish bond markets that are similar to the Swedish QE effects only after controlling for exchange rate fluctuations, highlighting the importance of exchange rate dynamics in the transmission of QE spillover effects.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/04/quantitative-easing-bond-risk-premia-and-the-exchange-rate-in-a-small-open-economy,2024-13,4/15/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,4/16/2024

We estimate that access to a five-year loan decreases the values of community- and experience-rated insurance for the average beneficiary by $232–$366 (58–61%).

We disentangle the friction potentially associated to CBDC adoption, assessing two of its potential drivers: information frictions and gradual diffusion of digital payment methods.

This paper shows that after 40 years of data collection, the remaining NLYS79 sample continues to be broadly representative of their national cohorts with regard to key labor market outcomes. For NLSY79 age cohorts, life-cycle profiles of employment, hours worked, and earnings are comparable to those in the Current Population Survey.

This paper shows that after 40 years of data collection, the remaining NLYS79 sample continues to be broadly representative of their national cohorts with regard to key labor market outcomes. For NLSY79 age cohorts, life-cycle profiles of employment, hours worked, and earnings are comparable to those in the Current Population Survey.

International Reserve Management under Rollover Crises,"Mauricio Barbosa-Alves, Javier Bianchi, César Sosa-Padilla","This paper investigates how a government should manage international reserves when it faces the risk of a rollover crisis. We ask, should the government accumulate reserves or reduce debt to make itself less vulnerable? We show that the optimal policy entails initially reducing debt, followed by a subsequent increase in both debt and reserves as the government approaches a safe zone. Furthermore, we uncover that issuing additional debt to accumulate reserves can lead to a reduction in sovereign spreads.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/working-papers/international-reserve-management-under-rollover-crises,805,17-Apr-24,FED-MINNEAPOLIS,4/18/2024
Are Medicaid and Medicare Patients Treated Equally?,"Calvin Ackley, Abe Dunn, Eli Liebman, Adam Hale Shapiro","We examine whether Medicaid recipients receive the same health care services as those on Medicare. We track the services provided to the same individual as they age into Medicare from Medicaid at age 65, becoming dual enrolled. Cost sharing remains negligible across the insurance switch, implying that observed changes in service provision reflect supply-side factors. Service provision increases by about 20 percent upon switching to Medicare, across a range of categories and treatments including high-value care. We find that 60 to 90 percent of the increase in office visits is explained by physicians averse to accepting new Medicaid patients. Geographic variation in our estimates shows that the average increase in utilization is larger in those states with lower Medicaid acceptance rates and higher Medicare acceptance rates. By contrast, we find relatively small increases in care from existing Medicaid providers. This analysis indicates that Medicaid’s smaller provider network plays a large role in limiting service provision.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/04/are-medicaid-and-medicare-patients-treated-equally,2024-14,4/17/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,4/19/2024
The Big Shift in Working Arrangements: Eight Ways Unusual,Steven J. Davis,"The COVID-19 pandemic instigated a big shift in working arrangements. I first describe the scale of this shift in the United States, drawing on the Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes and other sources.

The big shift had surprisingly benign (or even positive) effects on productivity, which is one reason it has endured. Compared to other shocks that strike modern economies, the big shift is also unusual in other respects: It relaxes time budget constraints, improves flexibility in time use, enhances individual autonomy, relaxes locational constraints, drives a major re-sorting of workers to jobs and employers, and alters the structure of wages. The big shift also reduces wage-growth pressures during the transition to new working arrangements and life styles.

Central bank asset purchases and auction cycles revisited: new evidence from the euro area,Federico Maria Ferrara,"This study provides new evidence on the relationship between unconventional monetary policy and auction cycles in the euro area. Using proprietary data on purchases of public sector securities implemented by the Eurosystem, the paper examines the flow effects of asset purchase programmes on 10-year government bond yields in secondary markets around dates of public debt auctions. The findings indicate that Eurosystem�s asset purchase flows mitigate yield cycles during auction periods and counteract the amplification impact of market volatility. The dampening effect of central bank asset purchases on auction cycles is more sizeable and precisely estimated for purchases of securities with medium-term maturities and in jurisdictions with relatively lower credit ratings.

Why Does Working from Home Vary Across Countries and People?,"Pablo Zarate, Mathias Dolls, Steven J. Davis, Nicholas Bloom, Jose Maria Barrero, Cevat Giray Aksoy","We use two surveys to assess why work from home (WFH) varies so much across countries and people. A measure of cultural individualism accounts for about one-third of the cross-country variation in WFH rates. Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US score highly on individualism and WFH rates, whereas Asian countries score low on both. Other factors such as cumulative lockdown stringency, population density, industry mix, and GDP per capita also matter, but they account for less of the variation. When looking across individual workers in the United States, we find that industry mix, population density and lockdown severity help account for current WFH rates, as does the partisan leaning of the county in which the worker resides.

Monetary asmmetries without (and with) price stickiness,Ivan Jaccard,"The evidence suggests that monetary policy transmission is asymmetric over the business cycle. Interacting financing frictions with a preference for liquidity provides an explanation for this fact. Our mechanism generates monetary asymmetries in a model that jointly reproduces a set of asset market and business cycle facts. Accounting for the joint dynamics of asset prices and business cycle fluctuations is key; in a variant of the model that is unable to produce realistic macro-finance implications, monetary asymmetries disappear. Our results suggest that asymmetries in the transmission mechanism critically depend on the macro-finance implications of monetary policy models, and that resorting to nonlinear techniques is not sufficient to detect monetary asymmetries.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2928~457d40bbd9.en.pdf?12221d72c50094dcb10e1edc594e1dc9,2928,19-Apr-24,ECB,4/19/2024
The Life-Cycle Dynamics of Wealth Mobility,"Richard Audoly, Rory McGee, Sergio Ocampo, and Gonzalo Paz-Pardo","We use twenty-five years of tax records for the Norwegian population to study the mobility of wealth over people’s lifetimes. We find considerable wealth mobility over the life cycle. To understand the underlying mobility patterns, we group individuals with similar wealth rank histories using agglomerative hierarchical clustering, a tool from statistical learning. The mobility patterns we elicit provide evidence of segmented mobility. Over 60 percent of the population remains at the top or bottom of the wealth distribution throughout their lives. Mobility is driven by the remaining 40 percent, who move only within the middle of the distribution. Movements are tied to differential income trajectories and business activities across groups. We show parental wealth is the key predictor of who is persistently rich or poor, while human capital is the main predictor of those who rise and fall through the middle of the distribution.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1097,1097,4/16/2024,FED-NEWYORK,4/19/2024

Emphasizing income insurance increased ISA uptake by 43%.

Using bankruptcy protection changes between 1999 and 2005 across U.S. states, we find that borrowers respond to greater protection by increasing their unsecured debt. Border county estimates suggest that local economic conditions do not drive these results. Borrowers pay more for protection through higher interest rates, yet delinquency is unaffected. Remarkably, our results indicate that rising borrower demand outstripped decreasing supply.

Assessing the Common Ownership Hypothesis in the US Banking Industry,Serafin Grundl and Jacob Gramlich,"The U.S. banking industry is well suited to assess the common ownership hypothesis (COH), because thousands of private banks without common ownership (CO) compete with hundreds of public banks with high and increasing levels of CO. This paper assesses the COH in the banking industry using more comprehensive ownership data than previous studies. In simple comparisons of raw deposit rate averages we document that (i) private banks do offer substantially more attractive deposit rates than public banks, but (ii) the deposit rates of public banks are similar in markets without CO where a single public bank competes only with private rivals, and in markets with CO where multiple public banks compete with each other. Panel regressions of deposit rates on the profit weights implied by the COH are generally consistent with the COH if only quarter FEs (without other controls) are included but not if bank-quarter FEs are included. Estimates with bank-quarter FEs are “precise zeros” with 95% CIs suggesting that the threefold rise in CO among public banks between 2005 and 2022 moved their deposit rates by less than a quarter of a basis point in either direction. To assess the COH along non-price dimensions we also estimate the effect of CO on deposit quantities, and find that the estimates are also not consistent with the COH.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/assessing-the-common-ownership-hypothesis-in-the-us-banking-industry.htm,2024-022,24-Apr,FED-BOARD,4/20/2024
Does it Pay to Send Multiple Pre-Paid Incentives? Evidence from a Randomized Experiment,"Andrew C. Chang, Joanne W. Hsu, Eva Ma, Kate Bachtell, and Micah Sjoblom","To encourage survey participation and improve sample representativeness, the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) offers an unconditional pre-paid monetary incentive and separate post-paid incentive upon survey completion. We conducted a pre-registered between-subject randomized control experiment within the 2022 SCF, with at least 1,200 households per experimental group, to examine whether changing the pre-paid incentive structure affects survey outcomes. We assess the effects of: (1) altering the total dollar value of the pre-paid incentive (“incentive effect”), (2) giving two identical pre-paid incentives holding the total dollar value fixed (“reminder effect”), and (3) offering multiple pre-paid incentives of different amounts holding the total dollar value fixed (“slope effect”) on survey response rates, interviewer burden, and data quality. Our evidence indicates that a single $15 pre-paid incentive increases response rates and maintains similar levels of interviewer burden and data quality, relative to a single $5 pre-paid incentive. Splitting the $15 into two pre-paid incentives of different amounts increases interviewer burden though lengthening time in the field without improving response rates, reducing the number of contact attempts needed for a response, or improving data quality, regardless of whether the first pre-paid is larger or smaller than the second.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/does-it-pay-to-send-multiple-pre-paid-incentives-evidence-from-a-randomized-experiment.htm,2024-023,24-Apr,FED-BOARD,4/20/2024

Corporate Mergers and Acquisitions Under Lender Scrutiny,"Buhui QIu, Teng Wang","This paper examines corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&A) outcomes under lender scrutiny. Using the unique shocks of U.S. supervisory stress testing, we find that firms under increased lender scrutiny after their relationship banks fail stress tests engage in fewer but higher-quality M&A deals. Evidence from comprehensive supervisory data reveals improved credit quality for newly originated M&A-related loans under enhanced lender scrutiny. This improvement is further evident in positive stock return reactions to M&A deals financed by loans subject to enhanced lender scrutiny. As companies engage in fewer but higher-quality deals, they also experience higher returns on assets.

Is There Hope for the Expectations Hypothesis?,"Richard K. Crump, Stefano Eusepi, and Emanuel Moench","Most macroeconomic models impose a tight link between expected future short rates and the term structure of interest rates via the expectations hypothesis (EH). While the EH has been systematically rejected in the data, existing work evaluating the EH generally assumes either full-information rational expectations or stationarity of beliefs, or both. As such, these analyses are ill-equipped to refute the EH when these assumptions fail to hold, fueling hopes for a “resurrection” of the EH. We introduce a model of expectations formation which features time-varying means and accommodates deviations from rationality. This model tightly matches the entire joint term structure of expectations for output growth, inflation, and the short-term interest rate from all surveys of professional forecasters in the U.S. We show that deviations from rationality and drifting long-run beliefs consistent with observed measures of expectations, while sizable, do not come close to bridging the gap between the term structure of expectations and the term structure of interest rates. Not only is the EH decisively rejected in the data, but model-implied short-rate expectations generally display, at best, only a weak co-movement with the forward rates of corresponding maturities.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1098,1098,4/18/2024,FED-NEWYORK,4/20/2024

Our model predicts that industry-wide technological advancements, such as recent progress in data collection and processing, induce a disproportionate and socially inefficient reallocation of resources toward surplus-appropriating activities. As technology improves, firms rely more on appropriation to obtain their profits, endogenously reducing the impact of technological progress on economic progress and inflating the price of the resources used for both types of activities.

Return Migration and Human Capital Flows,"Naser Amanzadeh, Amir Kermani & Timothy McQuade","We bring to bear a novel dataset covering the employment history of about 450 million individuals from 180 countries to study return migration and the impact of skilled international migration on human capital stocks across countries. Return migration is a common phenomenon, with 38% of skilled migrants returning to their origin countries within 10 years. Return migration is significantly correlated with industry growth in the origin and destination countries, and is asymmetrically exposed to negative firm employment growth. Using an AKM-style model, we identify worker and country-firm fixed effects, as well as the returns to experience and education by location and current workplace. For workers in emerging economies, the returns to a year of experience in the United States are 59-204% higher than a year of experience in the origin country. Migrants to advanced economies are positively selected on ability relative to stayers, while within this migrant population, returnees exhibit lower ability. Simulations suggest that eliminating skilled international migration would have highly heterogeneous effects across countries, adjusting total (average) human capital stocks within a range of -60% to 40% (-3% to 4%).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32352,32352,24-Apr,NBER,4/22/2024

Economists have studied how likely this is to happen, and whether it is efficient, using models where buyers are price or quantity takers, even though these industries are often also characterized by buyer-seller negotiations. We extend the dynamic “learning-by-doing and forgetting” model of Besanko, Doraszelski, Kryukov, and Satterthwaite (2010) to allow for Nash-in-Nash bargaining over prices. Price-taking and the social planner solution are captured as special cases. We show that sellers’ dynamic incentives, market concentration and welfare can change sharply, and non-monotonically, as one moves away from the price-taking assumption.

Balancing Federalism: The Impact of Decentralizing School Accountability,"Eric A. Hanushek, Patricia Saenz-Armstrong & Alejandra Salazar","Education policy, while primarily the responsibility of the state governments, involves complicated decision making at the local, state, and federal levels.  The federal involvement dramatically increased with the introduction of test-based accountability under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.  But, reflecting resistance to various parts of this law, the involvement of federal policy making was substantially reduced when Congress passed the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015.  This change in policy allows estimation of the impact of altered federalism.  By looking at how states reacted to their enhanced decision-making role, we see a retreat from the use of output-based policy toward teachers, and this retreat was associated with significantly lower student achievement growth.   As a result, this readjustment of federalism to decision making by lower levels appeared to lower national achievement.  The snapshot of federalism impacts here is a lower bound on the effects as more states will very likely react to the flexibility of ESSA and as more school districts change their teacher force.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32351,32351,24-Apr,NBER,4/22/2024
The Benefits and Costs of Secured Debt,Efraim Benmelech,"Secured debt—a debt contract that offers security to creditors in the form of collateralized assets—has been a cornerstone of credit markets in most societies since antiquity. The ability to seize and sell collateral reduces the creditor’s expected losses when the debtor defaults on a promised payment. Moreover, when a firm borrows from multiple creditors with different seniorities, debt secured by assets has higher priority relative to other creditors and is first in line for payment if the firm is bankrupt. While the benefits of secured debt have been shown in both the theoretical and empirical literature, less is known about the costs associated with secured borrowing. This paper surveys the burgeoning empirical literature on secured debt and provides an assessment of the costs and benefits of secured debt.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32353,32353,24-Apr,NBER,4/22/2024
Child Tax Benefits and Labor Supply: Evidence from California,"Jacob Goldin, Tatiana Homonoff, Neel A. Lal, Ithai Lurie & Katherine Michelmore","The largest tax-based social welfare programs in the US limit their benefits to taxpayers with labor market income. Eliminating these work requirements would better target transfers to the neediest families but risks attenuating tax-based incentives to work. We study changes in labor force participation from the elimination of a work requirement in a tax credit for parents of young children, drawing on quasi-random variation in birth timing and administrative tax records. To do so, we develop and implement a novel approach for selecting an empirical specification to maximize the precision of our estimate. The unique design of the policy along with its subsequent reform allow us to isolate taxpayers' sensitivity to conditioning child tax benefits on work -- the parameter at the center of recent debates about the labor supply consequences of reforming federal tax policy for children. We estimate that eliminating the work requirement causes very few mothers to exit the labor force, with a 95% confidence interval excluding labor supply reductions of one-third of a percentage point or greater. Our results suggest expanding tax benefits for low-income children need not meaningfully reduce labor force participation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32343,32343,24-Apr,NBER,4/22/2024

For NLSY79 age cohorts, life-cycle profiles of employment, hours worked, and earnings are comparable to those in the Current Population Survey. Moreover, average lifetime earnings over the age range 25 to 55 closely align with the same measure in Social Security Administration data. Our results suggest that the NLSY79 can continue to provide useful data for economists and other social scientists studying life-cycle and lifetime labor market outcomes, including earnings inequality.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32361,32361,24-Apr,NBER,4/22/2024
Decomposing systemic risk: the roles of contagion and common exposures,"Grzegorz Hałaj, Ruben Hipp","We evaluate the effects of contagion and common exposure on banks� capital through a regression design inspired by the structural VAR literature and derived from the balance sheet identity. Contagion can occur through direct exposures, fire sales, and market-based sentiment, while common exposures result from portfolio overlaps. We estimate the structural regression on granular balance sheet and interbank exposure data of the Canadian banking market. First, we document that contagion varies in time, with the highest levels around the Great Financial Crisis and lowest levels during the pandemic. Second, we find that after the introduction of Basel III the relative importance of risks has changed, hinting that sources of systemic risk have changed structurally. Our new framework complements traditional stress-tests focused on single institutions by providing a holistic view of systemic risk.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2929~19cda4a673.en.pdf?3adeb0d62e6ac2fe19eabd979cea75f0,2929,22-Apr-24,ECB,4/22/2024
Macroeconomics of Mental Health,"Boaz Abramson, Job Boerma & Aleh Tsyvinski","We develop an economic theory of mental health. The theory is grounded in classic and modern psychiatric literature, is disciplined with micro data, and is formalized in a life-cycle heterogeneous agent framework. In our model, individuals experiencing mental illness have pessimistic expectations and lose time due to rumination. As a result, they work less, consume less, invest less in risky assets, and forego treatment which in turn reinforces mental illness. We quantify the societal burden of mental illness and evaluate the efficacy of prominent policy proposals. We show that expanding the availability of treatment services and improving treatment of mental illness in late adolescence substantially improve mental health and welfare.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32354,32354,24-Apr,NBER,4/22/2024
A Field Experiment on Antitrust Compliance,Kei Kawai & Jun Nakabayashi,"We study the effectiveness of firms' compliance programs by conducting a field experiment in which we disclose to a subset of Japanese firms that the firm is potentially engaging in illegal bid-rigging. We find that the information that we disclose affects the bidding behavior of the treated firms: our test of bid-rigging is less able to reject the null of competition when applied to the bidding data of the treated firms after the intervention. We find evidence that this change is not the result of firms ceasing to collude, however. We find evidence suggesting that firms continue to collude even after our intervention and that the change in the bidding behavior we document is the result of active concealment of evidence by cartelizing firms.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32347,32347,24-Apr,NBER,4/22/2024
Nowcasting consumer price inflation using high-frequency scanner data: evidence from Germany,"Günter W. Beck, Kai Carstensen, Jan-Oliver Menz, Richard Schnorrenberger, Elisabeth Wieland","We study how millions of granular and weekly household scanner data combined with machine learning can help to improve the real-time nowcast of German inflation. Our nowcasting exercise targets three hierarchy levels of inflation: individual products, product groups, and headline inflation. At the individual product level, we construct a large set of weekly scanner-based price indices that closely match their official counterparts, such as butter and coffee beans. Within a mixed-frequency setup, these indices significantly improve inflation nowcasts already after the first seven days of a month. For nowcasting product groups such as processed and unprocessed food, we apply shrinkage estimators to exploit the large set of scanner-based price indices, resulting in substantial predictive gains over autoregressive time series models. Finally, by adding high-frequency information on energy and travel services, we construct competitive nowcasting models for headline inflation that are on par with, or even outperform, survey-based inflation expectations.

Jobs in industries where the number of job applicants skews female, offer lower starting salaries than jobs in industries where applicants skew male. During Nigeria’s 2016 recession, overall job applications rose, but applications to jobs in industries that skew male increased more than applications to jobs in industries that skew female.

While the supply side of the misinformation market has begun to receive increased scrutiny, the demand side has received scant attention. We explore the demand for misinformation through the lens of augmenting critical thinking skills in a field experiment during the 2022 Presidential election in Colombia. Data from roughly 2.000 individuals suggest that our treatments enhance critical thinking, causing subjects to more carefully consider the truthfulness of potential misinformation.

Does Inflation Affect Earnings Relevance? A Century-Long Analysis,"Oliver Binz, John Graham & Matthew Kubic","Financial reports present assets, liabilities, and earnings on a nominal basis (unadjusted for inflation). Using a novel dataset of nearly a century of financial reports, this paper examines whether and how inflation affects the relation between accounting earnings and stock market value, i.e., earnings relevance. On the one hand, inflation may decrease earnings relevance as historical cost accounting relies on historical transaction prices that become less relevant when inflation changes the price level. On the other hand, inflation may increase earnings relevance by increasing firms’ discount rates and thereby shifting agents’ focus towards nearer-term payoffs. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, we document a strong positive relation between earnings relevance and inflation. Cross-sectional tests indicate that this relation is stronger for firms that are more sensitive to discount rate changes. We find that inflation is of first-order importance relative to determinants of earnings relevance explored in prior literature.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32364,32364,24-Apr,NBER,4/22/2024

Human Capital Spillovers and Health: Does Living Around College Graduates Lengthen Life?,"Jacob H. Bor, David M. Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser & Ljubica Ristovska","Equally educated people are healthier if they live in more educated places. Every 10 percent point increase in an area’s share of adults with a college degree is associated with a decline in all-cause mortality by 7%, controlling for individual education, demographics, and area characteristics. Area human capital is also associated with lower disease prevalence and improvements in self-reported health. The association between area education and health increased greatly between 1990 and 2010. Spatial sorting does not drive these externalities; there is little evidence that sicker people move disproportionately into less educated areas. Differences in health-related amenities, ranging from hospital quality to pollution, explain no more than 17% of the area human capital spillovers on health. Over half of the correlation between area human capital and health is a result of the correlation between area human capital and smoking and obesity. More educated areas have stricter regulations regarding smoking and more negative beliefs about smoking. These have translated over time into a population that smokes noticeably less and that is less obese, leading to increasing divergence in health outcomes by area education.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32346,32346,24-Apr,NBER,4/22/2024
"Homelessness and the Persistence of Deprivation: Income, Employment, and Safety Net Participation","Bruce Meyer, Angela Wyse, Gillian Meyer, Alexa Grunwaldt, Derek Wu","Homelessness is arguably the most extreme hardship associated with poverty in the United States, yet people experiencing homelessness are excluded from official poverty statistics and much of the extreme poverty literature. This paper provides the most detailed and accurate portrait to date of the level and persistence of material disadvantage faced by this population, including the first national estimates of income, employment, and safety net participation based on administrative data. Starting from the first large and nationally representative sample of adults recorded as sheltered and unsheltered homeless taken from the 2010 Census, we link restricted-use longitudinal tax records and administrative data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicare, Medicaid, Disability Insurance (DI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), veterans’ benefits, housing assistance, and mortality. Nearly half of these adults had formal employment in the year they were observed as homeless, and nearly all either worked or were reached by at least one safety net program. Nevertheless, their incomes remained low for the decade surrounding an observed period of homelessness, suggesting that homelessness tends to arise in the context of long-term, severe deprivation rather than large and sudden losses of income. People appear to experience homelessness because they are very poor despite being connected to the labor market and safety net, with low permanent incomes leaving them vulnerable to the loss of housing when met with even modest disruptions to life circumstances.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/homelessness-and-the-persistence-of-deprivation-income-employment-and-safety-net-participation/,2024-48,20-Apr-24,BFI,4/23/2024

Dominant currency pricing in international trade of services,"João Amador, Arnaud Mehl, Martin Schmitz, Joana Garcia","We analyze, for the first time, how firms choose the currency in which they price transactions in international trade of services and investigate, using direct evidence, whether the US dollar (USD) plays a dominant role in services trade. Drawing on a new granular dataset on extra-European Union exports of Portuguese firms broken down by currency, we show that currency choices in services trade are active firm-level decisions. Firms that are larger and rely more on inputs priced in foreign currencies are less likely to use the domestic currency to export services. Importantly, we show that the USD has a dominant role as a vehicle currency in trade of services � but to a lesser extent than in trade of goods � and that this is not just due to differences in the geography of trade. An external validity test based on macro data available for Portugal and six other European countries confirms this finding. In line with predictions from recent theoretical models, our results are consistent with the lower prevalence of USD in services trade arising from a lower openness of services markets and a stronger reliance of services on domestic inputs.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2932~3bbd264674.en.pdf?c61fc524aa5ba8d6006aac835192cb5b,2932,22-Apr-24,ECB,4/23/2024
Mutual funds and safe government bonds: do returns matter?,"Marco Graziano, Maurizio Michael Habib","This paper investigates the sensitivity of the demand for safe government debt to currency unhedged and hedged excess returns in a sample of US mutual funds. We find evidence of active rebalancing towards government bonds that offer relatively higher returns on an unhedged basis, in particular euro denominated securities. The size of the effect is large, leading to a change in portfolio share by around one percentage point on average in response to a change by one percentage point in the currency-specific excess return. Interestingly, mutual funds rebalance their portfolio towards currencies, such as the Japanese yen, that display large deviations in the covered interest parity and offer higher returns than US Treasuries on an hedged basis. Finally, when global financial risk is on the rise, US mutual fund managers repatriate their investments towards US government debt securities, mainly at the expenses of euro-denominated ones. Our results imply that deviations in pricing conditions like uncovered and covered interest parity for sovereign bonds affect capital flows from the United States towards other major currency areas.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2931~8b0e21c2d2.en.pdf?c3e58b3b933f62fbcc309b9c1ae3f3aa,2931,23-Apr-24,ECB,4/23/2024
Child Tax Benefits and Labor Supply: Evidence from California,"Jacob Goldin, Tatiana Homonoff, Neel A. Lal, Ithai Lurie, Katherine Michelmore","The largest tax-based social welfare programs in the US limit their benefits to taxpayers with labor market income. Eliminating these work requirements would better target transfers to the neediest families but risks attenuating tax-based incentives to work. We study changes in labor force participation from the elimination of a work requirement in a tax credit for parents of young children, drawing on quasi-random variation in birth timing and administrative tax records. To do so, we develop and implement a novel approach for selecting an empirical specification to maximize the precision of our estimate. The unique design of the policy along with its subsequent reform allow us to isolate taxpayers’ sensitivity to conditioning child tax benefits on work – the parameter at the center of recent debates about the labor supply consequences of reforming federal tax policy for children. We estimate that eliminating the work requirement causes very few mothers to exit the labor force, with a 95% confidence interval excluding labor supply reductions of one-third of a percentage point or greater.

Liquidity transformation and Eurosystem credit operations,Benjamin Hartung,"Banks in the euro area can generate high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by borrowing central bank reserves from the Eurosystem against non-HQLA collateral. This paper quantifies the extent of this liquidity transformation and finds that on average EUR 0.92 of net HQLA are generated for each euro of credit provided by the Eurosystem. The paper then identifies intentional liquidity transformation using two novel approaches: The first approach compares the liquidity profile of already pledged vs new collateral, and the second approach compares the liquidity profile of the pool of pledged securities with banks' total eligible securities holdings. Both approaches show that banks use their least liquid assets as collateral first and pledge more liquid assets only at the margin. This intentional liquidity transformation is sizable and accounts for 30-60% of generated HQLA. These results are relevant for calibrating the collateral framework as well as the optimal size and composition of the Eurosystem balance sheet.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2933~8546fb6350.en.pdf?ae34159c7f4118b01464b183e669f7d4,2933,24-Apr-24,ECB,4/25/2024
Monetary policy strategies to navigate post-pandemic inflation: an assessment using the ECB’s New Area-Wide Model,"Matthieu Darracq Pariès, Antoine Kornprobst, Romanos Priftis","We evaluate how the euro area economy would have performed since mid-2021 under alternative monetary policy strategies. We use the ECB�s workhorse estimated DSGE model and contrast actual policy conduct against alternative strategies which differ in their �lower-for-longer� commitment as well as policymaker preferences regarding inflation and output volatility. Assuming that the monetary authority had full knowledge of prevailing conditions from mid-2021 onwards, the alternative policy strategies would call for anticipated timing of the start of the hiking cycle: earlier tightening would prevent inflation from peaking at 10%, but the forceful tightening since 2022:Q3 prevented higher inflation from becoming entrenched. However, once evaluating monetary policy on real-time quarterly vintages of incoming data and projections, the alternative interest rate paths would be broadly consistent with the observed policy conduct. The proximity of some benchmark optimal policy counterfactuals with the baseline, brings further indication that the actual policy conduct succeeded in implementing an efficient management of the output-inflation trade-off.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2935~639250ee2b.en.pdf?7febafbc28fe30a5405069521fdaff2e,2935,26-Apr-24,ECB,4/26/2024
Macro and micro of external finance premium and monetary policy transmission,"Carlo Altavilla, Refet S. Gürkaynak, Rogier Quaedvlieg","We establish basic facts about the external finance premium. Tens of millions of individual loan contracts extended to euro area firms allow studying the determinants of the external finance premium at the country, bank, firm, and contract levels of disaggregation. At the country level, the variance in the premium is closely linked to sovereign spreads, which are important in understanding financial amplification mechanisms. However, country-level differences only explain half of the total variance. The rest is predominantly attributed to variances at the bank and firm levels, which are influenced by the respective balance sheet characteristics. Studying the response of the external finance premium to monetary policy, we find that balance sheet vulnerabilities of banks and firms strengthen the transmission of policy measures to financing conditions. Moreover, our findings reveal an asymmetrical effect contingent upon the sign and type of the policies. Specifically, policy rate hikes and quantitative easing measures exert a more pronounced impact on lending spreads, further magnified through their repercussions on the external finance premium.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2934~c3addfeb73.en.pdf?2b2cc959f62ef161428c70ad68706bc7,2934,26-Apr-24,ECB,4/26/2024

The role of finance for export dynamics: evidence from the UK,Aydan Dogan and Ida Hjortsoe,"Through what channels do fluctuations in the financial costs of exporting affect exports, and how important are financial conditions for export dynamics over the business cycle? We first establish, using balance sheet data for UK manufacturing firms, that exporting firms have more short-term liabilities than non-exporting firms. We find evidence consistent with exporting firms taking on these short-term loans to (partly) cover labour costs. We then build a model with heterogeneous firms in which exporters need to access external finance to export, in line with the evidence, and parameterise it to UK data. We use rich firm level data to inform the calibration of the financial costs facing exporting firms, and estimate the shock processes in our model with Bayesian methods. Our estimations show that global shocks to the financial costs of exporting are the main driver of UK export dynamics over the business cycle, alongside shocks to productivity. These two shocks each contribute to around a third of UK export dynamics. Moreover, we find that global shocks to the financial costs of exporting played a crucial role in explaining the fall in UK exports in the early stages of the Global Trade Collapse, and slowed the recovery.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/the-role-of-finance-for-export-dynamics-evidence-from-the-uk,1072,"Fri, 26 Apr 2024 ",BOE,4/27/2024
An approach to cleaning MiFID II corporate bond transaction reports,Simon Jurkatis,"Since 2018, EU and UK financial markets regulators have been in receipt of data on transactions in debt instruments, such as corporate bonds, reported under the Markets in Financial Instrument Regulation. The data gives regulators a more detailed and broader view of trading in these instruments than previously. Reports submitted under this framework, however, come with a number of unique challenges that require careful consideration. Among those challenges are that reports are not submitted in a completely standardised way, that prices and quantities can be reported in different units, and that reports may be submitted by both counterparties of a transaction.

Public Debt Dynamics and the Impact of Fiscal Policy,Nikhil Patel ; Adrian Peralta Alva,"Public debt-to-GDP ratios have undergone substantial fluctuations over both the short and long term. Most recently, global debt-to-GDP ratios peaked at 100% on average in 2020 due to COVID-19, retracting substantially by 2022. To understand what drives these movements, we propose a structural approach to debt decompositions based on a SVAR identified with narrative sign restrictions. We find that GDP growth shocks and the corresponding comovements of macroeconomic variables are the key drivers of debt to GDP, accounting for 40% of the observed yearly variation in 17 advanced economies since the 1980s. Discretionary fiscal policy changes, in turn, account for less than 20% of the observed changes. The analysis also finds the primary balance multiplier on GDP to be very small.

Central Banks Casting a Global Financial Safety Net: What Drives the Supply of Bilateral Swaps?,Jakree Koosakul ; Alexei Miksjuk,"The expansion of bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) since the Global Financial Crisis has led to a substantial reconfiguration of the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN). This paper examines the drivers of BSA supply using a novel dataset on all publicly documented BSAs. It finds that countries with well-developed financial markets and institutions and high trade openness are more likely to backstop other economies by establishing BSAs. In addition, their choice of BSA counterparts is driven by strong investment and trade exposures to these countries, with variation in the relative importance of these factors across major BSA providers.

The Pitfalls of Protectionism: Import Substitution vs. Export-Oriented Industrial Policy,Reda Cherif ; Fuad Hasanov,"Industrial policies pursued in many developing countries in the 1950s-1970s largely failed while the industrial policies of the Asian Miracles succeeded. We argue that a key factor of success is industrial policy with export orientation in contrast to import substitution. Exporting encouraged competition, economies of scale, innovation, and local integration and provided market signals to policymakers.

Cash Flow Analysis of Fiscal Regimes for Extractive Industries,Thomas Benninger ; Dan Devlin ; Eduardo Camero Godinez ; Nate Vernon,"Mining and petroleum projects share characteristics distinguishing them from other sectors of the economy, which has led to the use of dedicated fiscal regimes for these projects. The IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department uses fiscal modeling to evaluate extractive industry fiscal regimes for its member countries, and trains country officials on key modeling concepts. This paper outlines important preconditions needed for effective fiscal modeling, key evaluation metrics, and emphasizes the importance of transparent modeling practices. It then examines the modeling of commonly-used fiscal instruments and highligts where their economic impact differs, and how fiscal models can inform fiscal regime design.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/04/27/Cash-Flow-Analysis-of-Fiscal-Regimes-for-Extractive-Industries-548359,2024-089,"Fri, 26 Apr 2024 ",IMF,4/27/2024
Upward Mobility in Developing Countries,Garance Genicot ⓡ Debraj Ray ⓡ Carolina Concha-Arriagada,"This article provides an overview of the literature on mobility in developing countries. Explicit distinctions are drawn between directional and non-directional measures, absolute and relative measures, and combinations thereof. We note that the scarcity of panel data has hindered the measurement of mobility for many countries. We pay particular attention to the recent development of panel-free mobility measures, which allows us to measure upward mobility in 122 countries. Throughout this review, we discuss some central themes in the literature.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32391,32391,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Immigration's Effect on US Wages and Employment Redux,Alessandro Caiumi & Giovanni Peri,"In this article we revive, extend and improve the approach used in a series of influential papers written in the 2000s to estimate how changes in the supply of immigrant workers affected natives' wages in the US. We begin by extending the analysis to include the more recent years 2000-2022. Additionally, we introduce three important improvements. First, we introduce an IV that uses a new skill-based shift-share for immigrants and the demographic evolution for natives, which we show passes validity tests and has reasonably strong power. Second, we provide estimates of the impact of immigration on the employment-population ratio of natives to test for crowding out at the national level. Third, we analyze occupational upgrading of natives in response to immigrants. Using these estimates, we calculate that immigration, thanks to native-immigrant complementarity and college skill content of immigrants, had a positive and significant effect between +1.7 to +2.6\% on wages of less educated native workers, over the period 2000-2019 and no significant wage effect on college educated natives. We also calculate a positive employment rate effect for most native workers. Even simulations for the most recent 2019-2022 period suggest small positive effects on wages of non-college natives and no significant crowding out effects on employment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32389,32389,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Estimating Racial Disparities When Race is Not Observed,"Cory McCartan, Robin Fisher, Jacob Goldin, Daniel E. Ho & Kosuke Imai","The estimation of racial disparities in various fields is often hampered by the lack of individual-level racial information. In many cases, the law prohibits the collection of such information to prevent direct racial discrimination. As a result, analysts have frequently adopted Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) and its variants, which combine individual names and addresses with Census data to predict race. Unfortunately, the residuals of BISG are often correlated with the outcomes of interest, generally attenuating estimates of racial disparities. To correct this bias, we propose an alternative identification strategy under the assumption that surname is conditionally independent of the outcome given (unobserved) race, residence location, and other observed characteristics. We introduce a new class of models, Bayesian Instrumental Regression for Disparity Estimation (BIRDiE), that take BISG probabilities as inputs and produce racial disparity estimates by using surnames as an instrumental variable for race. Our estimation method is scalable, making it possible to analyze large-scale administrative data. We also show how to address potential violations of the key identification assumptions. A validation study based on the North Carolina voter file shows that BISG+BIRDiE reduces error by up to 84% when estimating racial differences in party registration. Finally, we apply the proposed methodology to estimate racial differences in who benefits from the home mortgage interest deduction using individual-level tax data from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Open-source software is available which implements the proposed methodology.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32373,32373,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Meritocracy across Countries,"Oriana Bandiera, Ananya Kotia, Ilse Lindenlaub, Christian Moser & Andrea Prat","Are labor markets in higher-income countries more meritocratic, in the sense that worker-job matching is based on skills rather than idiosyncratic attributes unrelated to productivity? If so, why? And what are the aggregate consequences? Using internationally comparable data on worker skills and job skill requirements of over 120,000 individuals across 28 countries, we document that workers' skills better match their jobs' skill requirements in higher-income countries. To quantify the role of worker-job matching in development accounting, we build an equilibrium matching model that allows for cross-country differences in three fundamentals: (i) the endowments of multidimensional worker skills and job skill requirements, which determine match feasibility; (ii) technology, which determines the returns to matching; and (iii) idiosyncratic matching frictions, which capture the role of nonproductive worker and job traits in the matching process. The estimated model delivers two key insights. First, improvements in worker-job matching due to reduced matching frictions account for only a small share of cross-country income differences. Second, however, improved worker-job matching is crucial for unlocking the gains from economic development generated by adopting frontier endowments and technology.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32375,32375,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Teaching Teachers To Use Computer Assisted Learning Effectively: Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Evidence,"Philip Oreopoulos, Chloe Gibbs, Michael Jensen & Joseph Price","Mastery learning - the process by which students must demonstrate proficiency with a single topic before moving on - is well recognized as one of the most effective ways to learn, yet many teachers struggle or remain unsure about how to implement it into a classroom setting.  This study evaluates a program to encourage greater mastery learning through technology and proactive continuous teacher support. Focusing on elementary and middle school mathematics, teachers receive weekly coaching in how to use Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) for helping students follow a customized roadmap of incremental progress. Results from two field experiments indicate significant Intent To Treat effects on math performance of 0.12 - 0.22 standard deviations. Further analysis indicates that these gains are from students in classrooms with at least an average of 35 minutes of practice per week. Teachers able to achieve high-dosage practice have a high degree of initial buy-in, a clear implementation strategy for when practice occurs, and a willingness to closely monitor progress and follow-up with struggling students.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32388,32388,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Transparency and Percent Plans,Adam Kapor,"Transparency vs. opacity is an important dimension of college admission policy. Colleges may gain useful information from a holistic review of applicants’ materials, but in doing so may contribute to uncertainty that discourages potential applicants with poor information. This paper investigates the impacts of admissions transparency in the context of Texas’ Top Ten Percent Plan, using survey and administrative data from Texas and a model of college applications, admissions, enrollment, grades, and persistence. I estimate that two thirds of the plan’s 9.1 point impact on top-decile students’ probability of attending a flagship university was due to information rather than mechanical effects. Students induced to enroll are more likely to come from low- income high schools, and academically outperform the students that they displace. These effects would be larger if complemented by financial-aid information, and are driven by transparency, not misalignment between the rules used for automatic and discretionary admissions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32372,32372,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
The Impact of Lump-Sum Retirement Withdrawals on Labor Supply: Evidence from Peru,Carla Moreno & Sita Slavov,"We examine the labor supply impact of a 2016 policy that allows retirement-eligible individuals covered by Peru’s private pension system to receive retirement benefits as a lump sum rather than as an annuity. We present a theoretical model predicting that, for liquidity constrained workers, the lump sum option makes formal employment (requiring pension participation) more attractive relative to informal employment (not requiring pension participation); it also encourages early retirement. Using household panel data, we estimate the impact of the 2016 policy on the labor supply of workers covered by the private pension system compared to workers covered by the alternative pay-as-you-go defined benefit pension (which was unaffected by the policy). The policy is associated with an increase in the probability of being retired at ages 50 (early retirement age for women), 55 (early retirement age for men), and 65 (full retirement age for all workers). We also find increases in formal sector employment among women in their late 40s and men in their early 50s, consistent with increased efforts to qualify for early retirement (which requires recent pension contributions). The policy’s effects are concentrated among workers with less education, who are more likely to be liquidity constrained.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32380,32380,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Mechanism Reform: An Application to Child Welfare,"E. Jason Baron, Richard Lombardo, Joseph P. Ryan, Jeongsoo Suh & Quitze Valenzuela-Stookey","In many market-design applications, a new mechanism is introduced to reform an existing institution. Compared to the design of a mechanism in isolation, the presence of a status-quo system introduces both challenges and opportunities for the designer. We study this problem in the context of reforming the mechanism used to assign Child Protective Services (CPS) investigators to reported cases of child maltreatment in the U.S. CPS investigators make the consequential decision of whether to place a child in foster care when their safety at home is in question. We develop a design framework built on two sets of results: (i) an identification strategy that leverages the status-quo random assignment of investigators—along with administrative data on previous assignments and outcomes—to estimate investigator performance; and (ii) mechanism-design results allowing us to elicit investigators’ preferences and efficiently allocate cases. This alternative mechanism can be implemented by setting personalized non-linear rates at which each investigator can exchange various types of cases. In a policy simulation, we show that this mechanism reduces the number of investigators’ false positives (children placed in foster care who would have been safe in their homes) by 10% while also decreasing false negatives (children left at home who are subsequently maltreated) and overall foster care placements. Importantly, the mechanism is designed so that no investigator is made worse-off relative to the status quo. We show that a naive approach which ignores investigator preference heterogeneity would generate substantial welfare losses for investigators, with potential adverse effects on investigator recruitment and turnover.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32369,32369,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Ethics and Illusions: How Ethical Declarations Shape Market Behavior,"John M. Barrios, Jeremy Bertomeu, Radhika Lunawat & Ibrahima Sall","We examine the impacts of ethical declarations on market transactions through a controlled laboratory experiment, where privately-informed sellers issue a public report prior to a first-price auction. We find that while signing an ethical statement does not reduce misreporting by sellers, it significantly increases buyer trust, often skewing the terms of the trade in favor of sellers. Contrary to rational expectations, buyers consistently struggle to undo the bias. In counterfactual scenarios, from our structural analysis, we find that price efficiency improves when buyers rationally process uncertainty about sellers' ethical preferences, yet bias persists even when buyers have more accurate perceptions of sellers'’ ethical standards. Overall, our results suggests that disclosure interventions aimed at enhancing ethical conduct in market settings may not necessarily lead to more efficient pricing or reduced bias, and in some instances, may even disadvantage certain market participants.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32385,32385,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
"Cities, Heterogeneous Firms, and Trade","Jan David Bakker, Alvaro Garcia Marin, Andrei V. Potlogea, Nico Voigtländer & Yang Yang","Does international trade affect the growth of cities, and vice versa? Assembling disaggregate data for four countries, we document a novel stylized fact: Export activity is disproportionately concentrated in larger cities – even more so than overall economic activity. We rationalize this fact by marrying a standard quantitative spatial economics model with a heterogeneous firm model that features selection into the domestic and the export market. Our model delivers novel predictions for the bi-directional interactions between trade and urban dynamics: On the one hand, trade liberalization shifts employment towards larger cities, and on the other hand, liberalizing land use raises exports. We structurally estimate the model using data for the universe of Chinese manufacturing and French firms. We find that trade policies have quantitatively meaningful impacts on urban outcomes and vice versa, and that the aggregate effects of trade and urban policies differ from more standard models that do not account for the interaction between trade and cities. In addition, a distinguishing prediction of our model – which we confirm in the data – is that local trade elasticities vary systematically with city size, so that a country's aggregate trade elasticity depends on the spatial distribution of production within its borders.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32377,32377,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024

Why Does Working from Home Vary Across Countries and People?,"Pablo Zarate, Mathias Dolls, Steven J. Davis, Nicholas Bloom, Jose Maria Barrero & Cevat Giray Aksoy","We use two surveys to assess why work from home (WFH) varies so much across countries and people. A measure of cultural individualism accounts for about one-third of the cross-country variation in WFH rates. Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US score highly on individualism and WFH rates, whereas Asian countries score low on both. Other factors such as cumulative lockdown stringency, population density, industry mix, and GDP per capita also matter, but they account for less of the variation. When looking across individual workers in the United States, we find that industry mix, population density and lockdown severity help account for current WFH rates, as does the partisan leaning of the county in which the worker resides. We conclude that multiple factors influence WFH rates, and technological feasibility is only one of them.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32374,32374,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Slow Learning,"Lawrence Christiano, Martin S. Eichenbaum & Benjamin K. Johannsen","This paper investigates what features of an economy determine whether convergence under learning is fast or slow. In all of the models that we consider, people's beliefs about model outcomes are central determinants of those outcomes. We argue that under certain circumstances, convergence of a learning equilibrium to the rational expectations equilibrium can be so slow that policy analysis based on rational expectations is very misleading. We also develop new analytic results regarding rates of convergence in learning models.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32358,32358,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
The Provision of Information and Incentives in School Assignment Mechanisms,Derek Neal & Joseph Root,"Research on centralized school assignment mechanisms often focuses on whether parents who participate in specific mechanisms are likely to truthfully report their preferences or engage in various costly strategic behaviors. However, a growing literature suggests that parents may not know enough about the school options available to them to form complete preference rankings. We develop a simple model that explains why it is not surprising that many participants in school assignment mechanisms possess limited information about the schools available to them. We then discuss policies that could improve both the information that participants bring to school assignment mechanisms and the quality of the schools in their choice sets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32378,32378,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Inflation Preferences,"Hassan Afrouzi, Alexander Dietrich, Kristian Myrseth, Romanos Priftis & Raphael Schoenle","We document novel survey-based facts on preferred long-run inflation rates among U.S. consumers. Consumers on average prefer a 0.20% annual inflation rate, considerably below the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Inflation preferences not only correlate with demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, but also with economic reasoning. A randomized control trial reveals that two narratives based on economic models—describing how inflation lowers the real value of wages as well as money holdings—affect inflation preferences. While our results can inform the design of central bank communication on inflation targets, they also raise questions about the alignment between such targets and consumer preferences.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32379,32379,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Gaining Steam: Incumbent Lock-in and Entrant Leapfrogging,"Richard Hornbeck, Shanon Hsuan-Ming Hsu, Anders Humlum & Martin Rotemberg","We examine the long transition from water to steam power in US manufacturing, focusing on early users of mechanical power: lumber and flour mills. Digitizing Census of Manufactures manuscripts for 1850 to 1880, we show that as steam costs declined, manufacturing activity grew faster in counties with less waterpower potential. This growth was driven by steam powered entrants and agglomeration, as water powered incumbents faced switching barriers primarily from sunk costs. Estimating a dynamic model of firm entry and steam adoption, we find that the interaction of switching barriers and high fixed costs creates a quantitatively important and socially inefficient drag on technology adoption. Despite substantial entry and exit, switching barriers remained influential for aggregate steam adoption throughout the 19th century, as water power required lower fixed costs and therefore was attractive to relatively low productivity entrants. These entrants then became incumbents, locked into water power even if their productivity grew.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32384,32384,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Loopholes and the Incidence of Public Services: Evidence from Funding Career & Technical Education,"Thomas Goldring, Brian Jacob, Daniel Kreisman & Michael Ricks","In 2015, Michigan increased its Career and Technical Education (CTE) funding and changed its funding formula to reimburse programs-based student progression through program curricula. Although this change nearly doubled program completion rates, student enrollment and persistence were unaffected; instead, administrators accelerated student progress by reorganizing course curricula around notches in the new funding formula. As a result of response heterogeneity, 30% of the funding increase is transferred away from high-poverty districts to more affluent ones, underscoring how supply-side responses to loopholes shape the incidence of public services.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32390,32390,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
The Dollar versus the Euro as International Reserve Currencies,"Menzie D. Chinn, Jeffrey A. Frankel & Hiro Ito","We begin by examining determinants of aggregate foreign exchange reserve holdings by central banks (size of issuing country’s economy and financial markets, ability of the currency to hold value, and inertia).  But understanding the determination of reserve holdings probably requires going beyond the aggregate numbers, instead observing individual central bank behavior, including characteristics of the holding country (bilateral trade with the issuing country, bilateral currency peg, and proxies for bilateral exposure to sanctions), in addition to the characteristics of the reserve currency issuer. On a currency-by-currency basis, US dollar holdings are somewhat well explained by several issuer characteristics; but the other currencies are less successfully explained. It may be that the results from currency-by-currency estimation are impaired by insufficient sample size.  This consideration offers a motivation for pooling the data across the major currencies and imposing the constraints that reserve holdings are determined in the same way for each currency. In this setting, most economic determinants enter with significance: economic size as measured by GDP, size of financial markets as measured by foreign exchange turnover, bilateral currency peg, and bilateral trade share.  However, geopolitical variables (bilateral alliance, bilateral sanctions) usually do not enter with significance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32387,32387,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024

Do Female–Owned Employment Agencies Mitigate Discrimination and Expand Opportunity for Women?,Jennifer Hunt & Carolyn Moehling,"We create a dataset of 14,000 hand-coded help–wanted advertisements placed by employment agencies in three U.S. newspapers in 1950 and 1960, a time when help–wanted advertisements were divided into male and female sections, and collect information on agency ownership. We find that female-owned agencies specialized in vacancies for women, thereby expanding the access of female jobseekers to agency services, including for positions in majority-male occupations. Female-owned agencies advertised more skilled occupations to women than did male-owned agencies, leading to a 5.5% higher wage for women. On the other hand, female-owned agencies had a greater propensity to match male jobseekers to clerical jobs, contributing to 21% lower male wages than for male-owned agencies.  The results are consistent with female proprietors having had a comparative advantage in female jobseekers and clerical occupations or with client firms having trusted female proprietors only with vacancies for women and homogeneous, lower-skill occupations. However, in choosing to establish an agency and to specialize in female jobseekers, female proprietors may have sought to mitigate employer discrimination against female jobseekers; their higher propensity to advertise majority-male occupations among professional, technical and managerial advertisements for women may also reflect discrimination mitigation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32383,32383,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
Consumer-Financed Fiscal Stimulus: Evidence from Digital Coupons in China,"Jing Ding, Lei Jiang, Lucy Msall & Matthew J.

Using data from a large e-commerce platform and a bunching estimation approach, we find that the coupons caused large increases in spending of 3.1–3.3 yuan per yuan spent by the government. The large spending responses do not come from substitution away from non-targeted spending categories or from short-run intertemporal substitution. To rationalize these results, we develop a dynamic consumption model showing how coupons’ minimum spending thresholds create temporary notches that lead to large spending responses.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32376,32376,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024

Automated Social Science: Language Models as Scientist and Subjects,"Benjamin S. Manning, Kehang Zhu & John J. Horton","We present an approach for automatically generating and testing, in silico, social scientific hypotheses. This automation is made possible by recent advances in large language models (LLM), but the key feature of the approach is the use of structural causal models. Structural causal models provide a language to state hypotheses, a blueprint for constructing LLM-based agents, an experimental design, and a plan for data analysis. The fitted structural causal model becomes an object available for prediction or the planning of follow-on experiments. We demonstrate the approach with several scenarios: a negotiation, a bail hearing, a job interview, and an auction. In each case, causal relationships are both proposed and tested by the system, finding evidence for some and not others. We provide evidence that the insights from these simulations of social interactions are not available to the LLM purely through direct elicitation. When given its proposed structural causal model for each scenario, the LLM is good at predicting the signs of estimated effects, but it cannot reliably predict the magnitudes of those estimates. In the auction experiment, the in silico simulation results closely match the predictions of auction theory, but elicited predictions of the clearing prices from the LLM are inaccurate. However, the LLM's predictions are dramatically improved if the model can condition on the fitted structural causal model. In short, the LLM knows more than it can (immediately) tell.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32381,32381,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024
New Gig Work or Changes in Reporting? Understanding Self-Employment Trends in Tax Data,"Andrew Garin, Emilie Jackson & Dmitri K. Koustas","Rising self-employment rates in U.S. tax data that are absent in survey data have led to speculation that tax records capture a rise in new “gig” work that surveys miss. Drawing on the universe of IRS tax returns, we show that trends in firm-reported payments to “gig” and other contract workers do not explain the rise in self-employment reported to the IRS; rather, that increase is driven by self-reported earnings of individuals in the EITC phase-in range. We isolate pure reporting responses from real labor supply responses by examining births of workers’ first children around an end-of-year cutoff for credit eligibility that creates exogenous variation in tax rates at the end of the tax year after labor supply decisions are already sunk. We ﬁnd that ex-posing workers with sunk labor supply to negative marginal tax rates results in large increases in their propensity to self-report self-employment—only a small minority of which leads to bunching at kink-points. Consistent with pure strategic reporting behavior, we find no impact on reporting among taxpayers with no incentive to report additional income and no eﬀects on firm-reported payments of any kind. Moreover, we find these reporting responses have grown over time as knowledge of tax incentives has become widespread. Quantification exercises suggest that changes in taxpayer reporting behavior are a major driver of discrepancies between self-employment trends in self-reported and third-party reported data. Our findings suggest caution is warranted before deferring to self-reported tax data over other data sources when measuring labor market trends.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32368,32368,24-Apr,NBER,4/29/2024

Gaining Steam: Incumbent Lock-in and Entrant Leapfrogging,"Richard Hornbeck, Shanon Hsuan-Ming Hsu, Anders Humlum, Martin Rotemberg","We examine the long transition from water to steam power in US manufacturing, focusing on early users of mechanical power: lumber and flour mills. Digitizing Census of Manufactures manuscripts for 1850 to 1880, we show that as steam costs declined, manufacturing activity grew faster in counties with less waterpower potential. This growth was driven by steam powered entrants and agglomeration, as water powered incumbents faced switching barriers primarily from sunk costs. Estimating a dynamic model of firm entry and steam adoption, we find that the interaction of switching barriers and high fixed costs creates a quantitatively important and socially inefficient drag on technology adoption. Despite substantial entry and exit, switching barriers remained influential for aggregate steam adoption throughout the 19th century, as water power required lower fixed costs and therefore was attractive to relatively low productivity entrants. These entrants then became incumbents, locked into water power even if their productivity grew.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/gaining-steam-incumbent-lock-in-and-entrant-leapfrogging/,2024-54,30-Apr-24,BFI,5/1/2024
The Provision of Information and Incentives in School Assignment Mechanisms,"Derek Neal, Joseph Root","Research on centralized school assignment mechanisms often focuses on whether parents who participate in specific mechanisms are likely to truthfully report their preferences or engage in various costly strategic behaviors. However, a growing literature suggests that parents may not know enough about the school options available to them to form complete preference rankings. We develop a simple model that explains why it is not surprising that many participants in school assignment mechanisms possess limited information about the schools available to them. We then discuss policies that could improve both the information that participants bring to school assignment mechanisms and the quality of the schools in their choice sets.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/the-provision-of-information-and-incentives-in-school-assignment-mechanisms/,2024-55,30-Apr-24,BFI,5/1/2024

Income and the CARD Act’s Ability-to-pay Rule in the US Credit Card Market,"Scott Fulford, Joanna Stavins","In consumer credit, “ability-to-pay” (ATP) rules require lenders to consider whether the consumer can repay a loan without experiencing undue hardship. ATP rules have recently been implemented or considered in many countries and markets. Using a large panel of credit card accounts, we study the 2009 Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act’s ATP rule and its effect, if any, on the US credit card market. We find that the rule appears to have had no effect on bank credit decisions because actual credit limits are almost always substantially lower than reasonable ATP limits. We examine other factors that may explain banks’ credit decisions. Nearly 27 percent of consumer accounts that had a change in cardholder income received a credit limit increase of $100 or more in the same month as the income change. Most credit limit increases followed an income increase, although 19 percent of the instances of an income decrease also were followed by a credit limit increase. Most credit limit increases occurred without cardholders providing banks with income updates. The magnitude of the income change coefficient when an income update occurred is estimated to be nearly zero. We conclude that after the origination of an account, the direction and size of the account holder’s income updates are largely unimportant for credit limit changes from either a regulatory or bank profitability standpoint.",https://www.bostonfed.org//publications/research-department-working-paper/2024/income-card-act-ability-to-pay-rule-us-credit-card-market,24-3,1/19/2024,FED-BOSTON,5/3/2024
Risk Sharing and Amplification in the Global Banking Network,"Leslie Sheng  Shen, Tony Zhang","We develop a structural model of the global banking network and analyze its role in facilitating risk sharing and amplifying shocks across countries and over time. Using bilateral international lending data, we uncover significant heterogeneity in the willingness and capacity of banks to provide cross-border interbank and corporate loans. This heterogeneity explains variation in risk sharing and amplification across countries. Moreover, we show that cross-border loan supply has become less elastic over time, resulting in a decline in risk sharing. While shock amplification has also declined on average, some countries may experience greater amplification in response to foreign funding shocks.",https://www.bostonfed.org//publications/research-department-working-paper/2024/risk-sharing-and-amplification-in-the-global-banking-network.aspx,24-4,5/3/2024,FED-BOSTON,5/4/2024

"Monetary Policy Transmission in Emerging Markets: Proverbial Concerns, Novel Evidence",Ariadne Checo ; Francesco Grigoli ; Damiano Sandri,"Doubts persist about the effectiveness of monetary transmission in emerging markets, but the empirical evidence is scarce due to challenges in identifying monetary policy shocks. In this paper, we construct new monetary policy shocks using novel analysts’ forecasts of policy rate decisions. Crucial for identification, analysts can update forecasts up to the policy meeting, allowing them to incorporate any relevant data release. Using these shocks, we show that monetary transmission in emerging markets operates similarly to advanced economies. Monetary tightening leads to a persistent increase in bond yields, a contraction in real activity, and a delayed reduction in inflation. Furthermore, monetary policy impacts leveraged firms more strongly.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/05/03/Monetary-Policy-Transmission-in-Emerging-Markets-Proverbial-Concerns-Novel-Evidence-546642,2024-093,"Fri, 03 May 2024 ",IMF,5/4/2024

Challenges Facing SSNs in Emerging and Developing Economies:,Fernanda Brollo ; David Coady ; Samir Jahan ; Riki Matsumoto,"We show how the standard social welfare framework can be used to assess the performance of social safety nets (SSNs) in terms of targeting efficiency and budget effort. We apply this framework to the World Bank’s ASPIRE database and find that the variation in poverty alleviation achieved by SSNs in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) is driven mainly by variation in budget effort. Increasing transfer spending is therefore key to strengthening SSNs in EMDEs. However, the inability of many EMDEs to finely target transfers to poor households means the required spending increases are prohibitive over the short term, especially in low-income countries. This emphasizes the importance of enhancing targeting efficiency and we discuss how the use of proxy-means testing can contribute to this emphasizing the importance of careful design to manage the horizontal inequity inherent in such an approach to targeting.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/05/03/Challenges-Facing-SSNs-in-Emerging-and-Developing-Economies-548582,2024-096,"Fri, 03 May 2024 ",IMF,5/4/2024

Manufacturing Sentiment: Forecasting Industrial Production with Text Analysis,"Tomaz Cajner, Leland D. Crane, Christopher Kurz, Norman Morin, Paul E. Soto, Betsy Vrankovich","This paper examines the link between industrial production and the sentiment expressed in natural language survey responses from U.S. manufacturing firms. We compare several natural language processing (NLP) techniques for classifying sentiment, ranging from dictionary-based methods to modern deep learning methods. Using a manually labeled sample as ground truth, we find that deep learning models--partially trained on a human-labeled sample of our data--outperform other methods for classifying the sentiment of survey responses. Further, we capitalize on the panel nature of the data to train models which predict firm-level production using lagged firm-level text. This allows us to leverage a large sample of ""naturally occurring"" labels with no manual input. We then assess the extent to which each sentiment measure, aggregated to monthly time series, can serve as a useful statistical indicator and forecast industrial production. Our results suggest that the text responses provide information beyond the available numerical data from the same survey and improve out-of-sample forecasting; deep learning methods and the use of naturally occurring labels seem especially useful for forecasting. We also explore what drives the predictions made by the deep learning models, and find that a relatively small number of words--associated with very positive/negative sentiment--account for much of the variation in the aggregate sentiment index.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/manufacturing-sentiment-forecasting-industrial-production-with-text-analysis.htm,2024-026,24-May,FED-BOARD,5/4/2024
The Impact of Reduced Commuting on Labor Supply and Household Welfare: A Post-Pandemic Analysis,Yi Ji ; Myrto Oikonomou ; Carlo Pizzinelli ; Ippei Shibata ; Marina Mendes Tavares,"This paper examines the impact of changes in commuting time on welfare and labor supply in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing data from the American Time Use Survey, we observe a shift in commuting time and working hours across occupations with varying ability of telework after the pandemic. We develop a household model of labor supply that accounts for commuting time, and we characterize how changes in commuting time impact individuals' and spouses' labor supply. We calibrate the model to the data. Our findings reveal that the observed post-pandemic decline in commuting time yields significant welfare gains: between 1.5 to 4.5 percent of consumption equivalents for households where at least one spouse experiences reduced commuting.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/05/03/The-Impact-of-Reduced-Commuting-on-Labor-Supply-and-Household-Welfare-A-Post-Pandemic-548572,2024-094,"Fri, 03 May 2024 ",IMF,5/4/2024

Using novel machine-learning techniques, we estimate a flexible “nonlinear VAR” for the stance of monetary policy, real activity, inflation, and financial conditions, and evaluate counterfactual evolutions of downside risk to real activity under alternative monetary policy paths. We find that a tighter path of monetary policy in 2003-05 would have increased the risk of adverse real outcomes three to four years ahead, especially if the tightening had been large or rapid.

Mask Mandate Costs,"Patrick Carlin, Shyam Raman, Kosali I. Simon, Ryan Sullivan & Coady Wing","This paper presents the results from a hypothetical set of questions related to mask-wearing behavior and opinions that were asked of a nationally representative sample of over 4,000 participants in early 2022. Mask mandates were hotly debated in public discourse, and though much research exists on benefits of masks, there has been no research thus far on the distribution of perceived costs of compliance. As is common in economic research that aims to assess the value to society of non-market activities, we use survey valuation methods and ask how much participants would be willing to pay to be exempted from rules of mandatory community masking. The survey asks specifically about a 3 month exemption. We find that the majority of respondents (56%) are not willing to pay to be exempted from mandatory masking. However, the average person was willing to pay $525, and a small segment of the population (0.9%) stated they were willing to pay over $5,000 to be exempted from the mandate. Younger respondents stated higher willingness to pay to avoid the mandate than older respondents. Combining our results with standard measures of the value of a statistical life, we estimate that a 3 month masking order was perceived as cost effective through willingness-to-pay questions only if at least 13,333 lives were saved by the policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32349,32349,24-May,NBER,5/6/2024
Updating the retirement-consumption puzzle in Italy: who are the most affected?,Andrea Marini,"In this paper I investigate the retirement-consumption puzzle in Italy for the period 2010-2016, using SHIW data. In order to address the endogeneity of the retirement decision, I estimate the effect of retirement by exploiting the exogeneity of pension eligibility in an instrumental variable approach; the IV regression is then applied in a regression discontinuity design where only households close to the eligibility point are considered. The eligibility-instrument is found to be a strong predictor of the retirement decision, and the estimated non-durable consumption drop is equal to 12.3%. When households are distinguished according to the gender of the household head, female-led households are found to undergo a consumption decline that is more than double that estimated for households with male heads. The data and the literature on the subject indicate that this large difference is likely related to the gender pay-gap that translates into a gender pension-gap. Moreover, the consumption decline appears to be concentrated in households in the lower part of the wealth distribution. Nonetheless, households in the lowest wealth quintile, do not show a significant consumption decline. The data suggests that this might be due to the impossibility for these households to further reduce their consumption at retirement, as they are mostly composed of essential expenditures.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2936~a737938856.en.pdf?9c35d32e23fef23a7b962bf4b640d656,2936,6-May-24,ECB,5/6/2024
Empirical Tests of the Green Paradox for Climate Legislation,Maya A. Norman & Wolfram Schlenker,"The Green Paradox posits that fossil fuel markets respond to changing expectations about climate legislation, which limits future consumption, by shifting consumption to the present through lower present-day prices. We demonstrate that oil futures responded negatively to daily changes in the prediction market's expectations that the Waxman-Markey bill — the US climate bill discussed in 2009-2010 — would pass. This effect is consistent across various maturities as the proposed legislation would reset the entire price and consumption path, unlike temporary supply or demand shocks that phase out over time. The bill’s passage would have increased current global oil consumption by 2-4%. Furthermore, a strengthening of climate policy, as measured by monthly variations in media salience regarding climate policy over the last four decades, and two court rulings signaling limited future fossil fuel use, were associated with negative abnormal oil future returns. Taken together, our findings confirm that restricting future fossil fuel use will accelerate current-day consumption.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32405,32405,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024
Do Mortgage Lenders Respond to Flood Risk?,"Kristian S. Blickle, Evan Perry, and João A.C.

We find that lenders are less willing to originate mortgages and charge higher rates for lower LTV loans that face “un-mapped” flood risk. This effect is weaker for high income applicants, as well as non-banks and small local banks. However, we find evidence that non-banks and local banks are more likely to securitize/sell mortgages to borrowers prone to flood risk.

Quality Signaling and Demand for Renewable Energy Technology: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment,"Aidan Coville, Joshua S. Graff Zivin, Arndt Reichert & Ann-Kristin Reitmann","Solar technologies have been associated with private and social returns, but their technological potential often remains unachieved because of persistently low demand for high-quality products. In a randomized field experiment in Senegal, we assess the potential of three types of quality signaling to increase demand for high-quality solar lamps. We find no effect on demand when consumers are offered a money-back guarantee but increased demand with a third-party certification or warranty, consistent with the notion that consumers are uncertain about product durability rather than their utility. However, despite the higher willingness to pay, the prices they would pay are still well below market prices for the average household, suggesting that reducing information asymmetries alone is insufficient to encourage wider adoption. Surprisingly, we also find that the effective quality signals in our setting stimulate demand for low-quality products by creating product-class effects among those least familiar with the product.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32397,32397,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024

Enhanced Unemployment Insurance Benefits in the United States during COVID-19: Equity and Efficiency,Robert G.

The adverse economic impacts of the pandemic, notably the pattern of job losses and earnings reductions, were disproportionately born by lower-income individuals. Focusing on household income as a broad measure of well-being, we document that UI payments almost completely offset the increase in household income inequality that otherwise would have occurred in 2020 and 2021. We also examine the impacts of the $600 increase in weekly UI benefit payments, available during part of 2020, on job search outcomes. We find that despite the very high replacement rate of lost earnings for low-wage individuals, the search disincentive effects of the enhanced UI payments were limited overall and smaller for individuals from lower-income households.

Contrary to prior research, we find that corporate leverage rises after tax cuts for small private firms. An estimated dynamic equilibrium model shows that tax cuts make capital more productive and spur borrowing. Tax cuts also produce more distant default thresholds and lower credit spreads. These effects outweigh the lower interest tax deduction and lead to higher optimal leverage choices, especially for firms with flexible investment policies.

Access to Credit Reduces the Value of Insurance,"Sonia Jaffe, Anup Malani & Julian Reif","We analyze the value of insurance when individuals have access to credit markets. Loans allow consumers to smooth financial shocks over time, decreasing the value of consumption smoothing from insurance.

We estimate that access to a five-year loan decreases the values of community- and experience-rated insurance for the average beneficiary by $232-$366 (58--61%). Even for the sickest decile, this loan access reduces the value of community-rated insurance by $1,099 (17%).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32395,32395,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024
Building Non-Discriminatory Algorithms in Selected Data,"David Arnold, Will S.

These tools are applied in the context of pretrial bail decisions, where conventional algorithmic predictions are generated using only the misconduct outcomes of released defendants. We first show that algorithmic discrimination arises in such settings when the available algorithmic inputs are systematically different for white and Black defendants with the same objective misconduct potential. We then show how algorithmic discrimination can be eliminated by measuring and purging these conditional input disparities. Leveraging the quasi-random assignment of bail judges in New York City, we find that our new algorithms not only eliminate algorithmic discrimination but also generate more accurate predictions by correcting for the selective observability of misconduct outcomes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32403,32403,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024

From Predictive Algorithms to Automatic Generation of Anomalies,Sendhil Mullainathan & Ashesh Rambachan,"Machine learning algorithms can find predictive signals that researchers fail to notice; yet they are notoriously hard-to-interpret. How can we extract theoretical insights from these black boxes? History provides a clue. Facing a similar problem – how to extract theoretical insights from their intuitions – researchers often turned to “anomalies:” constructed examples that highlight flaws in an existing theory and spur the development of new ones. Canonical examples include the Allais paradox and the Kahneman-Tversky choice experiments for expected utility theory. We suggest anomalies can extract theoretical insights from black box predictive algorithms. We develop procedures to automatically generate anomalies for an existing theory when given a predictive algorithm. We cast anomaly generation as an adversarial game between a theory and a falsifier, the solutions to which are anomalies: instances where the black box algorithm predicts - were we to collect data - we would likely observe violations of the theory. As an illustration, we generate anomalies for expected utility theory using a large, publicly available dataset on real lottery choices. Based on an estimated neural network that predicts lottery choices, our procedures recover known anomalies and discover new ones for expected utility theory. In incentivized experiments, subjects violate expected utility theory on these algorithmically generated anomalies; moreover, the violation rates are similar to observed rates for the Allais paradox and Common ratio effect.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32422,32422,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024
The Costs and Benefits of Clan Culture: Elite Control versus Cooperation in China,"Shuo Chen, Raymond Fisman, Xiaohuan Lan, Yongxiang Wang & Qing Ye","Kinship ties are a common institution that may facilitate in-group coordination and cooperation. Yet their benefits – or lack thereof – depend crucially on the broader institutional environment. We study how the prevalence of clan ties affect how communities confronted two well-studied historical episodes from the early years of the People's Republic of China, utilizing four distinct proxies for county clan strength: the presence of recognized ancestral halls; genealogical records; rice suitability; and geographic latitude. We show that the loss of livestock associated with 1955-56 collectivization (which mandated that farmers surrender livestock for little compensation) documented by Chen and Lan (2017) was much less pronounced in strong-clan areas. By contrast, we show that the 1959-61 Great Famine was associated with higher mortality in areas with stronger clan ties. We argue that reconciling these two conflicting patterns requires that we take a broader view of how kinship groups interact with other governance institutions, in particular the role of kinship as a means of elite control.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32414,32414,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024

Contingent Trade Agreements,Bård Harstad,"There are often conflicts between proponents of trade and environmental activists. This paper shows, however, how trade agreements can be designed so as to motivate environmental conservation. I first analyze a standard trade model, where resource exploitation (e.g., deforestation) is a trade-specific investment that causes environmental damage. In this model, traditional trade agreements will cause more exploitation. Next, I investigate the extent to which conservation can be motivated by a contingent trade agreement (CTA), where default tariffs can vary with changes in the resource stock (e.g., the forest cover). The model permits many products, countries, and collaborators.

By applying natural language processing techniques to documents that Federal Reserve staff prepare in advance of policy decisions, we capture the Fed's information set. Using machine learning techniques, we then predict changes in the target interest rate conditional on this information set and obtain a measure of monetary policy shocks as the residual. We show that the documents' text contains essential information about the economy which is not captured by numerical forecasts that the staff include in the same documents. The dynamic responses of macro variables to our monetary policy shocks are consistent with the theoretical consensus. Shocks constructed by only controlling for the staff forecasts imply responses of macro variables at odds with theory. We directly link these differences to the information that our procedure extracts from the text over and above information captured by the forecasts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32417,32417,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024
"Learning from Ricardo and Thompson: Machinery and Labor in the Early Industrial Revolution, and in the Age of AI",Daron Acemoglu & Simon Johnson,"David Ricardo initially believed machinery would help workers but revised his opinion, likely based on the impact of automation in the textile industry. Despite cotton textiles becoming one of the largest sectors in the British economy, real wages for cotton weavers did not rise for decades. As E.P. Thompson emphasized, automation forced workers into unhealthy factories with close surveillance and little autonomy. Automation can increase wages, but only when accompanied by new tasks that raise the marginal productivity of labor and/or when there is sufficient additional hiring in complementary sectors. Wages are unlikely to rise when workers cannot push for their share of productivity growth. Today, artificial intelligence may boost average productivity, but it also may replace many workers while degrading job quality for those who remain employed. As in Ricardo’s time, the impact of automation on workers today is more complex than an automatic linkage from higher productivity to better wages.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32416,32416,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024
How Do U.S. Firms Withstand Foreign Industrial Policies?,"Xiao Cen, Vyacheslav Fos & Wei Jiang","China’s industrial policies (“Five-Year Plans”) displace U.S. production/employment and heighten plant closures in the same industries as those targeted by the policies in China. The impact was not anticipated by the stock market, but U.S. companies in the ""treated industries"" suffer a valuation loss afterwards. Firms shift production to upstream or downstream industries benefiting from the boost, or offshore to government-endorsed industries in China. Such within-firm adjustments offset the direct impact. U.S. firms are better able to withstand foreign government interventions provided that they enjoy flexibility, including preexisting business toeholds in the ""beneficiary"" industries, financial access, and labor fluidity.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32411,32411,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024

By using birth order effects as a proxy for family environment, and linked census data on men born between 1835 and 1910, we study how the family's role in human capital production evolved over this period.

Incentive-Compatible Unemployment Reinsurance for the Euro Area,"Alexander Karaivanov, Benoit Mojon, Luiz Pereira da Silva, Albert Pierres Tejada & Robert Townsend","We model a reinsurance mechanism for the national unemployment insurance programs of euro area member states. The risk-sharing scheme we analyze is designed to smooth country-level unemployment risk and expenditures around each country’s median level, so that participation and contributions remain incentive-compatible at all times and there are no redistributionary transfers across countries. We show that, relative to the status quo, such scheme would have provided nearly perfect insurance of the euro area member states’ unemployment expenditures risk in the aftermath of the 2009 sovereign debt crisis if allowed to borrow up to 2 percent of the euro area GDP. Limiting, or not allowing borrowing by the scheme would have still provided significant smoothing of surpluses and deficits in the national unemployment insurance programs over the period 2000–2019.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32396,32396,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024

Gender and Electoral Incentives: Evidence from Crisis Response,Juan Pablo Chauvin & Clemence Tricaud,"This paper provides new evidence on why men and women leaders make different choices. We first use a simple political agency model to illustrate how voters' gender bias can lead reelection-seeking female politicians to undertake different policies. We then test the model's predictions by exploring leaders’ responses to COVID-19. Assuming that voters expect policies to be less effective if decided by women, the model predicts that female politicians undertake less containment effort than male politicians when voters perceive the threat as low, while the opposite is true when voters perceive it as serious. Exploiting Brazilian close elections, we find that, early in the pandemic, female mayors were less likely to close non-essential businesses and female-led municipalities experienced more deaths per capita, while the reverse was true later on, once the health consequences materialized. These results are exclusively driven by mayors facing reelection and stronger in municipalities with greater gender discrimination.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32410,32410,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024
Understanding Demand for Police Alternatives,"Bocar A. Ba, Meghna Baskar & Rei Mariman","While police brutality has sparked demands to scale back policing, public constituencies still have limited knowledge about policing alternatives. In survey experiments, we provide information about dontcallthepolice.com—a database of police alternatives—and police violence statistics and evaluate their impact on respondents’ stated likelihood of calling the police. We find information about police alternatives increases the likelihood of relying on police in violent scenarios but significantly reduces it in scenarios for which police alternatives exist. These findings hold across political affiliations, suggesting broad support for limiting police involvement to violent crises and investing in police alternatives for nonviolent situations. In a follow-up survey six months later, individuals informed about police alternatives were 12 percentage points more likely to recall that the newly available 988 government hotline is available for suicidal crises, a result highlighting the enduring effectiveness of targeted educational interventions. Our study shows that providing information on existing 911 alternatives results in increased demand for these police substitutes in non-violent situations both in the short and long run.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32418,32418,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024

We show that simulation methods to compute these models can result in non-existence of pure strategy equilibrium.

Measuring Information Frictions in Migration Decisions: A Revealed-Preference Approach,"Charly Porcher, Eduardo Morales & Thomas Fujiwara","We investigate the role of information frictions in migration. We develop novel moment inequalities to estimate worker preferences while allowing for unobserved worker-specific information sets, migration costs, and location-specific amenities and prices. Using data on internal migration in Brazil, we find that common estimation procedures underestimate the importance of expected wages in migration choices, and that workers face substantial and heterogeneous information frictions. Model specification tests indicate that workers living in regions with higher internet access and larger populations have more precise wage information, and that information precision decreases with distance. Our estimated model predicts that information frictions play a quantitatively important role in reducing migration flows and worker welfare, and limit the welfare gains from reductions in migration costs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32413,32413,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024

We find that EE dynamics played an important role in shaping the differential inflation dynamics observed during the Great Recession and COVID-19 recoveries. Despite both recoveries sharing similar unemployment dynamics, the recovery from the Great Recession exhibited subdued EE transitions and inflation dynamics. In our model, the optimal monetary policy involves a strong positive response to EE fluctuations, suggesting that central banks should distinguish between recovery episodes with different EE dynamics even if they have similar unemployment rates.",https://doi.org/10.18651/RWP2024-04,2024-04,5/6/2024,FED-KANSASCITY,5/7/2024

"U.S. Worker Mobility Across Establishments within Firms: Scope, Prevalence, and Effects on Worker Earnings","Jeronimo Carballo, Richard K. Mansfield & Charles Adam Pfander","Multi-establishment firms account for around 60% of U.S. workers' primary employers, providing ample opportunity for workers to change their work location without changing their employer. Using U.S. matched employer-employee data, this paper analyzes workers' access to and use of such between-establishment job transitions, and estimates the effect on workers' earnings growth of greater access, as measured by proximity of employment at other within-firm establishments.  While establishment transitions are not perfectly observed, we estimate that within-firm establishment transitions account for 7.8% percent of all job transitions and 18.2% of transitions originating from the largest firms.  Using variation in worker's establishment locations within their firms' establishment network, we show that having a greater share of the firm's jobs in nearby establishments generates meaningful increases in workers' earnings: a worker at the 90th percentile of earnings gains from more proximate within-firm job opportunities can expect to enjoy 2% higher average earnings over the following five years than a worker at the 10th percentile with the same baseline earnings.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32420,32420,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024
Accounting for the Evolution of China’s Production and Trade Patterns,"Hanwei Huang, Jiandong Ju & Vivian Yue","This paper studies the evolution of China's production and trade patterns during its integration into the global economy. We document and explain new facts concerning changes in production and exports at the industry and firm levels using microdata and a quantitative Ricardian and Heckscher–Ohlin model with heterogeneous firms. Counterfactual simulations reveal that capital deepening made China's production and exports more capital-intensive, although labor-biased productivity growth acted as a counterforce. Consistent with the data, our model demonstrates that China's trade openness peaked around the mid-2000s and fell until the 2020s, while the world's exposure to Chinese exports rose continuously.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32415,32415,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024
The Streetlight Effect in Data-Driven Exploration,"Johannes Hoelzemann, Gustavo Manso, Abhishek Nagaraj & Matteo Tranchero","We examine innovative contexts like scientific research or technical R&D where agents must search across many potential projects of varying and uncertain returns. Is it better to possess incomplete but accurate data on the value of some projects, or might there be cases where it is better to explore on a blank slate? While more data usually improves welfare, we present a theoretical framework to understand how it can unexpectedly decrease it. In our model of the streetlight effect, we predict that when data shines a light on attractive but not optimal projects, it can severely narrow the breadth of exploration and lower individual and group payoffs. We test our predictions in an online lab experiment and show that the availability of data on the true value of one project can lower individual payoffs by 17% and reduce the likelihood of discovering the optimal outcome by 54% compared to cases where no data is provided. Suggestive empirical evidence from genetics research illustrates our framework in a real-world setting: data on moderately promising genetic targets delays valuable discoveries by 1.6 years on average. Our paper provides the first systematic examination of the streetlight effect, outlining the conditions under which data leads agents to look under the lamppost rather than engage in socially beneficial exploration.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32401,32401,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024
Alleviating Worker Shortages Through Targeted Subsidies: Evidence from Incentive Payments in Healthcare,"Ashvin Gandhi, Andrew Olenski, Krista J. Ruffini & Karen Shen","Worker shortages are common in many industries. This paper examines the effect of government subsidies to address these shortages in the context of a reform that tied Medicaid payments to nursing home staffing levels. We find that the reform substantially increased staffing, especially for facilities serving many Medicaid patients. Facilities responded primarily by hiring workers in lower-wage roles rather than increasing hours of incumbent or high-wage staff. This contrasts with null effects we estimate for a non-incentivized rate increase, suggesting that the incentive structure of government payments—rather than just the level—is key to boosting employment in sectors facing worker shortages.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32412,32412,24-May,NBER,5/7/2024

A Theoretical Treatment of Foreign Fighters and Terrorism,Subhayu Bandyopadhyay and Todd Sandler,"The paper offers a game-theoretical model that includes three participants – the terrorist organization, its foreign fighters, and the adversarial host government.  In stage 1, the terrorist group induces foreign fighters to emigrate through wage incentives, while the host government deters these fighters through proactive border security.  Foreign fighters decide whether to emigrate from their source country (extensive margin) in stage 2, after which these fighters determine their level of attacks (intensive margin) in stage 3.  Comparative statics to the Nash equilibrium are tied to changes in the employment or opportunity cost in the source country, as well as to changes in radicalization.  Our basic model provides a theoretical foundation to recent empirical results. An extension involves a four-stage game with the host government assuming a leadership role prior to the terrorist group choosing its wage incentive.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-011,2024-011A,24-May,FED-STLOUIS,5/8/2024

Determinants of bank performance: evidence from replicating portfolios,"Carlo Altavilla, Lorenzo Burlon, Franziska Hünnekes, Juliane Begenau","We construct a novel measure of bank performance, investigate its determinants, and show that it affects bank resilience, lending behaviour and real outcomes. Using confidential and granular data, we measure performance against a market-based benchmark portfolio that mimics individual banks� interest rate and credit risk exposure. From 2015 to mid-2022, euro area banks underperformed market benchmarks by around e160 billion per year, amid substantial heterogeneity. Structural factors, such as cost inefficiencies, rather than monetary or regulatory measures, were the main driver of bank underperformance. We also show that higher edge banks are less reliant on government support measures and less likely to experience the materialisation of interest rate or credit risk when hit by shocks. Using the euro area credit register and the pandemic shock for identification, we find that higher edge banks originate more credit, direct it towards more productive firms, and support more firm investment.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2937~7e22f4dc25.en.pdf?cfd89af8a1ee5d2fec5516f38d91b6f6,2937,8-May-24,ECB,5/8/2024
Investor heterogeneity and large-scale asset purchases,"Johannes Breckenfelder, Veronica De Falco","Large-Scale Asset Purchases can impact the price of securities directly, when securities are targeted by the central bank, or indirectly through portfolio re-balancing of private investors. We quantify both the direct and the portfolio re-balancing impact, emphasizing the role of investor heterogeneity. We use proprietary security-level data on asset holdings of different investors. We measure the direct impact on security level, finding that it is smaller for securities predominantly held by more price-elastic investors, funds and banks. Comparing a security at the 90th percentile of the investor elasticity distribution to a security at the 10th percentile, the price impact is only two-thirds as large. To assess the portfolio re-balancing effects, we construct a novel shift-share instrument to measure investors� quasi-exogenous exposure to central bank purchases, based on investors� holdings of eligible securities before the QE program was announced. We show that funds and banks sell eligible securities to the central bank and re-balance their portfolios towards ineligible securities, with investors ex-ante more exposed to central bank purchases re-balancing more. Using detailed holdings data of mutual funds, we estimate that for each euro sold to the central bank, the average fund allocates 88 cents to ineligible assets and 12 cents to other eligible assets that the central bank does not buy in that time period. The price of ineligible securities held by more exposed funds increases compared to those held by less exposed funds, underscoring the portfolio re-balancing channel at work.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2938~6616ac1857.en.pdf?cdc68e5f700775ed02a384726e158340,2938,8-May-24,ECB,5/8/2024

Relationship Lending: That Ship Has Not Sailed for Community Banks,"Dmytro Hryshko, Joe Peek, Gökhan Torna","This study provides direct evidence of the value to banks arising from relationship lending by estimating the market premium placed on banking organizations’ small business loan portfolios. Using data from the small business loan survey contained in the June bank Call Reports, we find that small commercial and industrial (C&I) loans add value to community banks both in absolute terms and relative to the value contributed by larger C&I loans. The value-enhancing effect of small business loans is observed primarily at small community banks, and it was present during the Great Recession as well as during periods of more normal economic conditions. Furthermore, the value creation emanates primarily from the smallest relationship-based C&I loans, those with original values of $100,000 or less, and at the smallest community banks. By contrast, small commercial real estate (CRE) loans, being relatively more transactional than C&I loans, do not contribute additional value to community banking organizations.

Return to Office and the Tenure Distribution,"David Van Dijcke, Florian Gunsilius, Austin Wright","With the official end of the COVID-19 pandemic, debates about the return to office have taken center stage among companies and employees. Despite their ubiquity, the economic implications of return to office policies are not fully understood. Using 260 million resumes matched to company data, we analyze the causal effects of such policies on employees’ tenure and seniority levels at three of the largest US tech companies: Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple. Our estimation procedure is nonparametric and captures the full heterogeneity of tenure and seniority of employees in a distributional synthetic controls framework. We estimate a reduction in counterfactual tenure that increases for employees with longer tenure. Similarly, we document a leftward shift in the seniority distribution towards positions below the senior level. These shifts appear to be driven by employees leaving to larger firms that are direct competitors. Our results suggest that return to office policies can lead to an outflow of senior employees, posing a potential threat to the productivity, innovation, and competitiveness of the wider firm.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/return-to-office-and-the-tenure-distribution/,2024-56,7-May-24,BFI,5/8/2024
"Reshoring, Automation, and Labor Markets Under Trade Uncertainty","Sylvain Leduc, Zheng Liu, Hamid Firooz","We study the implications of trade uncertainty for reshoring, automation, and U.S. labor markets. Rising trade uncertainty creates incentive for firms to reduce exposures to foreign suppliers by moving production and distribution processes to domestic producers. However, we argue that reshoring does not necessarily bring jobs back to the home country or boost domestic wages, especially when firms have access to labor-substituting technologies such as automation. Automation improves labor productivity and facilitates reshoring, but it can also displace jobs. Furthermore, automation poses a threat that weakens the bargaining power of low-skilled workers in wage negotiations, depressing their wages and raising the skill premium and wage inequality. The model predictions are in line with industry-level empirical evidence.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/05/reshoring-automation-and-labor-markets-under-trade-uncertainty,2024-16,5/8/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,5/9/2024

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation expectations increased materially amid heightened uncertainty about future inflation. Likelihood of significant departures of inflation targets in the longer term reached about 15 percent in the middle of 2022, increasing from near zero levels in 2020.

Consumer Bankruptcy and Unemployment Insurance,"Diego Legal, Eric R. Young","We quantitatively evaluate the effects of UI on bankruptcy in an equilibrium model of labor market search and defaultable debt. First, we ask whether a standard unsecured credit model extended with labor market search and matching frictions can account for the negative correlation between UI caps and bankruptcy rates observed in the data. The model can account for this fact only if estimated with the employment rate among bankruptcy filers as a target. Not matching this employment rate underestimates the consumption smoothing benefits of UI cap increases, as the model assigns too much importance to unemployment shocks for driving default, and implies large welfare losses from increasing the cap rather than negligible gains. Second, with bankruptcy available, there are significant welfare gains from increasing the replacement rate above the calibrated value, but not in the absence of default.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2409-consumer-bankruptcy-and-unemployment-insurance,24-09,05.07.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,5/9/2024
Religious Worship Attendance in America: Evidence from Cellphone Data,Devin Pope,"Religious worship is integral to the lives of millions of Americans. In this paper, I provide a descriptive analysis of religious worship attendance using geodata from smartphones for over 2 million Americans in 2019. I establish several key findings. First, 73% of people step into a religious place of worship at least once during the year on the primary day of worship (e.g. Sundays for most Christian churches). However, only 5% of Americans attend services “weekly”, far fewer than the ~22% who report to do so in surveys. The number of occasional vs. frequent attenders varies substantially by religion. I estimate that approximately 45M Americans attend worship services in a typical week of the year, but with large changes around Holidays (e.g. Easter). I document how start times, duration of attendance, and average household income all differ meaningfully across religious traditions. The intensity of religious observance correlates with a host of other activities. For example, relative to non-attenders and infrequent attenders, frequent religious attenders are less likely to go to strip clubs, liquor stores, and casinos. While cell phone data has limitations, this paper provides a unique way of understanding worship attendance and its correlates.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/religious-worship-attendance-in-america-evidence-from-cellphone-data/,2024-58,8-May-24,BFI,5/9/2024
The macroeconomics of liquidity in financial intermediation,"Davide Porcellacchia, Kevin D. Sheedy","In financial crises, the premium on liquid assets such as US Treasuries increases alongside credit spreads. This paper explains the link between the liquidity premium and spreads. We present a theory of endogenous bank fragility arising from a coordination friction among bank creditors. The theory�s implications reduce to a single constraint on banks, which is embedded in a quantitative macroeconomic model to investigate the transmission of shocks to spreads and economic activity. Shocks that reduce bank net worth exacerbate the coordination friction. In response, banks lend less and demand more liquid assets. This drives up both credit spreads and the liquidity premium. By mitigating the coordination friction, expansions of public liquidity reduce spreads and boost the economy. Empirically, we identify high-frequency exogenous variation in liquidity by exploiting the time lag between auction and issuance of US Treasuries. We find a causal effect on spreads in line with the calibrated model.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2939~b796389f28.en.pdf?9d156a016972bb0fd8e975f081a99abe,2939,10-May-24,ECB,5/10/2024

First, we explain CoFiE-NN. Second, we compare the forecasting performance of CoFiE-NN with three conventional models using both Monte Carlo simulation and real data. To do so, we employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as our main specification of the NN. We then apply the CoFiE-NN for different asset classes, with a focus on foreign exchange markets. We report that CoFiE-NN outperfoms the conventional EGARCH-t model and the Extreme Value Theory model in several statistical criteria for both the simulated data and the real data. Finally, we introduce a new empirical proxy for tail risk named tail risk ratio under CoFiE-NN. We discover that the only 20 percent of tail risk dynamics across 22 currencies is explained by one common factor. This is contrasting to the fact that 60 percent of volatility dynamics across the same currencies is explained by one common factor.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/05/10/Forecasting-Tail-Risk-via-Neural-Networks-with-Asymptotic-Expansions-548841,2024-099,"Fri, 10 May 2024 ",IMF,5/11/2024
Conflicts and Growth: The R&D Channel,Can Sever,"Violent conflicts are typically associated with a long-lasting drag on economic output, yet establishing causality based on macro-data remains as a challenge. This study attempts to build causality in the conflict-growth nexus by exploiting within-country variation across industries’ technological intensity. It identifies a channel through which conflicts can impact growth, i.e., by hindering R&D activities. The analysis is based on industry-level data from two-digit manufacturing industries for a large sample of countries over the last four decades. The results show that conflicts lead to a decline in labor productivity growth, particularly in industries with higher technological intensity. The estimated magnitude of the differential effect of conflicts on labor productivity growth in high-tech industries is large. Moreover, the additional labor productivity loss in those industries in the years of conflicts does not seem to be offset in the post-conflict period neither. The findings offer insight into the observed patterns of durable declines in income in the aftermath of conflicts, considering the role of technological progress and innovation in long-term economic growth.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/05/10/Conflicts-and-Growth-The-R-D-Channel-548836,2024-098,"Fri, 10 May 2024 ",IMF,5/11/2024

Why Do Mutual Funds Invest in Treasury Futures?,"Benjamin Iorio, Dan Li, and Lubomir Petrasek","Asset managers’ net long positions in Treasury futures have reached their historical highs in recent months, driven in part by mutual funds’ demand for short- and medium-term Treasury futures. Analyzing mutual fund portfolio holdings reports on SEC Form N-PORT, we find that the increase in mutual funds’ futures holdings since 2020 can be attributed to both increased demand for Treasury exposures during a higher interest rate environment and mutual funds’ preference for sourcing these exposures through futures rather than securities.",https://www.federalreserve.gov//econres/notes/feds-notes/why-do-mutual-funds-invest-in-treasury-futures-20240510.html,1.02E+18,10-May-24,FED-BOARD-NOTES,5/11/2024
Cities as Engines of Opportunities: Evidence from Brazil,"Radu Barza, Edward L. Glaeser, César A. Hidalgo & Martina Viarengo","Are developing-world cities engines of opportunities for low-wage earners? In this study, we track a cohort of young low-income workers in Brazil for thirteen years to explore the contribution of factors such as industrial structure and skill segregation on upward income mobility. We find that cities in the south of Brazil are more effective engines of upward mobility than cities in the north and that these differences appear to be primarily related to the exposure of unskilled workers to skilled co-workers, which in turn reflects industry composition and complexity. Our results suggest that the positive effects of urbanization depend on the skilled and unskilled working together, a form of integration that is more prevalent in the cities of southern Brazil than in northern cities. This segregation, which can decline with specialization and the division of labor, may hinder the ability of Brazil's northern cities to offer more opportunities for escaping poverty.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32426,32426,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
The Negligible Effect of Free Contraception on Fertility: Experimental Evidence from Burkina Faso,"Pascaline Dupas, Seema Jayachandran, Adriana Lleras-Muney & Pauline Rossi","We conducted a randomized trial among 14,545 households in rural Burkina Faso to test the oft-cited hypothesis that limited access to contraception is an important driver of high fertility rates in West Africa. We do not find support for this hypothesis. Women who were given free access to medical contraception for three years did not have lower birth rates; we can reject even modest effects. We cross-randomized additional interventions to address possible inefficiencies leading to low demand for free contraception, specifically misperceptions about the child mortality rate, limited exposure to opposing views about family size and contraception, and social pressure. Free contraception did not influence fertility even in combination with these other interventions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32427,32427,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
Trade Wars and the Optimal Design of Monetary Rules,"Stéphane Auray, Michael B. Devereux & Aurélien Eyquem","Monetary rules may have a large effect on the outcome of trade wars if central banks target the CPI inflation rate or more generally changes in the relative price of traded goods. We lay out a two-country open-economy model with sticky prices where countries engage in trade wars. In the presence of monopoly pricing markups, we show that the final level of tariffs and welfare losses from trade wars critically depend on the design of monetary policy. If central banks adopt a fixed nominal exchange rate or even better target the CPI inflation rate, trade wars are much less intense than those under PPI inflation targeting. We further show that an optimally delegated monetary rule that internalizes the formation of non-cooperative trade policy can actually completely eliminate a trade war, and even act to partly offset the welfare cost of monopoly markups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32451,32451,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
The Dynamic Effects of Cash Transfers to Agricultural Households,"Shilpa Aggarwal, Jenny C.

Using bi-monthly survey data from recipients of a large, unconditional cash transfer in Liberia and Malawi, we document sustained food security improvements until 1.5-2 years after disbursement, driven by increased farm investments and production. We additionally document reductions in casual off-farm labor, increases in psychological well-being and, in Liberia, a decline in IPV. We find similar increases in harvest output across different transfer sizes.

To address this question, we propose a nested constant elasticity of substitution production function that distinguishes among three types of capital: traditional physical capital (machines, assembly lines), industrial robots, and AI. Following the literature, we assume that industrial robots predominantly substitute for low-skill workers, whereas AI mainly helps to perform the tasks of high-skill workers. We show that AI reduces the skill premium as long as it is more substitutable for high-skill workers than low-skill workers are for high-skill workers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32430,32430,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
The Macroeconomic Impact of Climate Change: Global vs. Local Temperature,Adrien Bilal & Diego R. Känzig,"This paper estimates that the macroeconomic damages from climate change are six times larger than previously thought. We exploit natural variability in global temperature and rely on time-series variation. A 1°C increase in global temperature leads to a 12% decline in world GDP. Global temperature shocks correlate much more strongly with extreme climatic events than the country-level temperature shocks commonly used in the panel literature, explaining why our estimate is substantially larger. We use our reduced-form evidence to estimate structural damage functions in a standard neoclassical growth model. Our results imply a Social Cost of Carbon of $1,056 per ton of carbon dioxide. A business-as-usual warming scenario leads to a present value welfare loss of 31%. Both are multiple orders of magnitude above previous estimates and imply that unilateral decarbonization policy is cost-effective for large countries such as the United States.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32450,32450,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
Demand For E-Cigarettes Based On Nicotine Strength: Evidence From Retail Sales,"Megan C. Diaz, Adrian Bertrand, Tatum McKay, Barbara A. Schillo, Bushraa S. Khatib & John A. Tauras","Using NielsenIQ Retail Scanner data, we estimate demand equations for e-cigarettes by nicotine concentration. Overall, the models show that the price elasticities of demand range from -2.117 to -1.494. In a rapidly evolving e-cigarette market, demand for e-cigarettes varies considerably by nicotine strength. High-nicotine products, which have many close substitutes, are found to be more responsive to changes in price. Demand for low-nicotine products, with few close substitutes, are found to be less responsive to changes in price. Our findings also suggest that e-cigarettes with the lowest and highest nicotine concentrations may be economic complements, suggesting concurrent use. Unlike available evidence on cross-tax elasticities of demand, we find no evidence of an economic relationship between traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes when broken down by nicotine strength concentration.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32435,32435,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
Revenue Slumps and Fiscal Capacity: Evidence from Brazil,"Claudio Ferraz, Dirk Foremny & Juan Francisco Santini","This paper investigates how non-tax revenues impact tax collection in Brazilian municipalities, focusing on shifts in intergovernmental transfers due to population updates. Our analysis reveals asymmetric effects of shocks: revenue gains lead to increased spending without tax reductions, while losses in transfers prompt investments in fiscal capacity and boost tax revenues. Enhancing fiscal capacity entails adjusting tax bureaucrat payments, improving property registries, and cracking down on delinquency, with heterogeneous responses based on political competition and the educational levels of local leaders and the bureaucracy. These findings emphasize the importance of rules that reduce the reliance on non-tax revenues and promote effective tax collection.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32440,32440,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024

Do E-Cigarette Retail Licensure Laws Reduce Tobacco Use?,"Charles J. Courtemanche, Yang Liang, Johanna Catherine Maclean, Caterina Muratori & Joseph J.

This study is the first to comprehensively explore the effect of ELL adoption on youth and adult tobacco product use. Using data from the State Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and a difference-in-differences approach, we find no evidence that ELL adoption reduces overall youth ENDS use. The precision of our estimates allows us to rule out, with 95 percent confidence, ELL-induced prior-month youth ENDS use declines of more than 3.4 percent. The pattern of null findings persists when we examine ELLs that impose (1) higher penalties for retailer non-compliance, (2) higher renewable licensure fees, and (3) criminal as compared to civil penalties. However, we do uncover evidence that adoption of ELLs with higher penalties associated with a modest reduction in ENDS use among Black teens.

We leverage a regression discontinuity design based on the age of the youngest child in the household relative to the date of eligibility recertification---once the youngest child turns six, many heads of household become subject to General Work Requirements. We use novel administrative SNAP data, linked with state Unemployment Insurance earnings records, and find these requirements have important SNAP disenrollment effects, negative spillover effects to other members of the household, and no large impacts on labor supply. Additionally, the main mechanism through which these disenrollment effects occur is through referrals to the mandatory state Employment and Training program.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32441,32441,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
Identifying the Cumulative Causal Effect of a Non-Binary Treatment from a Binary Instrument,Vedant Vohra & Jacob Goldin,"The effect of a treatment may depend on the intensity with which it is administered. We study identification of ordered treatment effects with a binary instrument, focusing on the effect of moving from the treatment’s minimum to maximum intensity. With arbitrary heterogeneity across units, standard IV assumptions (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) do not constrain this parameter, even among compliers. We consider a range of additional assumptions and show how they can deliver sharp, informative bounds. We illustrate our approach with two applications, involving the effect of (1) health insurance on emergency department usage, and (2) attendance in an after-school program on student learning.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32425,32425,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
What do Financial Markets say about the Exchange Rate?,"Mikhail Chernov, Valentin Haddad & Oleg Itskhoki","Financial markets play two roles with implications for  the exchange rate: they accommodate risk sharing and act as a source of shocks. In prevailing theories, these roles are seen as mutually exclusive and individually face challenges in explaining exchange rate dynamics. However, we demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case. We develop an analytical framework that characterizes the link between exchange rates and finance across all conceivable market structures. Our findings indicate that full  market segmentation is not necessary for financial shocks to explain exchange rates. Moreover, financial markets can accommodate a significant extent of international risk sharing without leading to the classic exchange rate puzzles. We identify plausible market structures where both roles coexist, addressing challenges faced when examined separately.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32436,32436,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024

Dollar Asset Holdings and Hedging Around the Globe,Wenxin Du & Amy W. Huber,"We analyze a large number of industry- and company-level filings of global institutional investors to provide the first comprehensive estimate of foreign investors' U.S. dollar (USD) security holdings and currency hedging practices.  We document four stylized facts.  First, driven by increasing portfolio allocations, foreign investors expanded their USD security holdings six-fold over the past two decades. Second, following the 2007-09 financial crisis, foreign mutual funds, insurers, and pensions raised their USD hedge ratio by an average of 15 percentage points, despite higher hedging costs implied by large and persistent deviations from covered interest-rate parity. The total FX hedging demand from these sector reached $2 trillion in 2019.  Third, there is considerable heterogeneity in hedging practice across countries and sectors. Fourth, the global banking sector provides limited dollar hedging on net, underscoring the important role non-banks play in fulfilling the hedging demand of foreign institutional investors.  We employ a mean-variance framework to benchmark investors' demand for USD assets and currency hedging practice, emphasizing the influence of expected returns on optimal portfolio construction and the apparent divergence between model predictions and observed hedging behaviors.

Optimal Mortgage Refinancing with Inattention,"David W. Berger, Konstantin Milbradt, Fabrice Tourre & Joseph S. Vavra","We build a model of optimal fixed-rate mortgage refinancing with fixed costs and inattention and derive a new sufficient statistic that can be used to measure inattention frictions from simple moments of the rate gap distribution. In the model, borrowers pay attention to rates sporadically so they often fail to refinance even when it is profitable. When paying attention, borrowers optimally choose to refinance earlier than under a perfect attention benchmark. Our model can rationalize almost all errors of “omission” (refinancing too slowly) and a large fraction of the errors of “commission” (refinancing too quickly) previously documented in the data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32447,32447,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
Causal Effects in Matching Mechanisms with Strategically Reported Preferences,"Marinho Bertanha, Margaux Luflade & Ismael Mourifié","A growing number of central authorities use assignment mechanisms to allocate students to schools in a way that reflects student preferences and school priorities. However, most real-world mechanisms incentivize students to strategically misreport their preferences. In this paper, we provide an approach for identifying the causal effects of school assignment on future outcomes that accounts for strategic misreporting. Misreporting may invalidate existing point-identification approaches, and we derive sharp bounds for causal effects that are robust to strategic behavior. Our approach applies to any mechanism as long as there exist placement scores and cutoffs that characterize that mechanism’s allocation rule. We use data from a deferred acceptance mechanism that assigns students to more than 1,000 university–major combinations in Chile. Matching theory predicts that students’ behavior in Chile should be strategic because they can list only up to eight options, and we find empirical evidence consistent with such behavior. Our bounds are informative enough to reveal significant heterogeneity in graduation success with respect to preferences and school assignment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32434,32434,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024

Among workers initially employed in manufacturing, we find substantial and persistent declines in both outcomes, with indirect exposure via input-output linkages exacerbating the negative effects of direct exposure.

Nonetheless, elementary achievement and early SES account for less than half of Black versus non-Black disparities in these outcomes.

We then test the key implications of this model using rich survey data and a mandate to randomly assign students to classrooms. Consistent with our model, we show that exposure to minority peers decreases student effort, parental investments, and teacher engagement and it results in lower student test scores.

(View all)","Mental health conditions are prevalent but rarely treated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Little is known about how these conditions affect economic participation. This paper shows that treating mental health conditions substantially improves recipients’ capacity to work in these contexts. First, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) ever conducted that evaluate treatments for mental ill-health and measure economic outcomes in LMICs. On average, treating common mental disorders like depression with psychotherapy improves an aggregate of labor market outcomes made up of employment, time spent working, capacity to work and job search by 0.16 standard deviations. Treating severe mental disorders, like schizophrenia, improves the aggregate by 0.30 standard deviations, but effects are noisily estimated. Second, we build a new dataset, pooling all available microdata from RCTs using the most common trial design: studies of psychotherapy in LMICs that treated depression and measured days participants were unable to work in the past month. We observe comparable treatment effects on mental health and work outcomes in this sub-sample of highly similar studies.

Disentangling Exploration from Exploitation,"Alessandro Lizzeri, Eran Shmaya & Leeat Yariv","Starting from Robbins (1952), the literature on experimentation via multi-armed bandits has wed exploration and exploitation. Nonetheless, in many applications, agents' exploration and exploitation need not be intertwined: a policymaker may assess new policies different than the status quo; an investor may evaluate projects outside her portfolio. We characterize the optimal experimentation policy when exploration and exploitation are disentangled in the case of Poisson bandits, allowing for general news structures. The optimal policy features complete learning asymptotically, exhibits lots of persistence, but cannot be identified by an index à la Gittins.

Pricing Innovation in Surgical Care Markets,"Alice Chen, Seth M. Freedman, Elizabeth L. Munnich & Michael R.

We examine such a context when Medicare sharply revises facility fees—while holding physician fees constant—for advanced surgical care performed within certain outpatient settings. Industry-wide output for impacted cases increases via market expansion, and indirectly affected physicians devote more labor supply to these cases by sacrificing other outpatient and inpatient surgical volumes. Government price setting for healthcare facilities spills over onto physicians––impacting their technology utilization and time allocations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32439,32439,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
Exorbitant Privilege: A Safe-Asset View,Zhengyang Jiang,"I propose a dynamic model of the reserve currency paradigm that centers on the liquidity demand for safe assets. In global recessions, the demand for the U.S. safe bond increases and raises its convenience yield, giving rise to a stronger dollar and a countercyclical seigniorage revenue. The seigniorage revenue raises the U.S. wealth and consumption shares in recessions, despite the U.S. suffering portfolio losses from its external positions. This asset demand channel also connects exchange rate dynamics to the marginal utility over bond holding, which provides new perspectives on exchange rate disconnect and on the relationship between exchange rates and capital flows. Under this safe-asset view, exorbitant privilege does not require exorbitant duty.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32454,32454,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
Demand-side and Supply-side Constraints in the Market for Financial Advice,Jonathan Reuter & Antoinette Schoar,"In this review, we argue that access to financial advice and the quality of this advice is shaped by a broad array of demand-side and supply-side constraints. While the literature has predominantly focused on conflicts of interest between advisors and clients, we highlight that the transaction costs of providing advice, mistaken beliefs on the demand side or supply side, and other factors can have equally detrimental effects on the quality and access to advice. Moreover, these factors affect how researchers should assess the impact of financial advice across heterogeneous groups of households. While households with low levels of financial literacy are more likely to benefit from advice—potentially including conflicted advice—they are also the least likely to detect misconduct, and perhaps the least likely to understand the value of paying for advice. Regulators should consider not only how regulation changes the quality of advice, but also the fraction of households who are able to receive it and how different groups would have invested without any advice.  Financial innovation has the potential to provide customized advice at low cost, but also to embed conflicts of interest in algorithms that are opaque to households and regulators.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32452,32452,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024

The Economics of Infertility: Evidence from Reproductive Medicine,"Sarah Bögl, Jasmin Moshfegh, Petra Persson & Maria Polyakova","WHO estimates that as many as 1 in 6 individuals of reproductive age worldwide are affected by infertility. This paper uses rich administrative population-wide data from Sweden to construct and characterize the universe of infertility treatments, and to then quantify the private costs of infertility, the willingness to pay for infertility treatments, as well as the role of insurance coverage in alleviating infertility. Persistent infertility causes a long-run deterioration of mental health and couple stability, with no long-run “protective” effects (of having no child) on earnings. Despite the high private non-pecuniary cost of infertility, we estimate a relatively low revealed private willingness to pay for infertility treatment. The rate of IVF initiations drops by half when treatment is not covered by health insurance. The response to insurance is substantially more pronounced at lower income levels. At the median of the disposable income distribution, our estimates imply a willingness to pay of at most 22% of annual income for initiating an IVF treatment (or about a 30% chance of having a child). At least 40% of the response to insurance coverage can be explained by a liquidity effect rather than traditional moral hazard, implying that insurance provides an important consumption smoothing benefit in this context. We show that insurance coverage of infertility treatments determines both the total number of additional children and their allocation across the socioeconomic spectrum.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32445,32445,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
"The Moral Values of ""Rugged Individualism""","Samuel Bazzi, Martin Fiszbein & Maximiliano Garcia","The United States is among the most individualistic societies in the world. However, unlike Western European individualism, which is imbued with moral universalism, America’s “rugged individualism” is instead particularistic. We link this distinctive cultural configuration to the country’s frontier history. The frontier favored self-reliance, but also rewarded cooperation, which could only be sustained through strong, local group identities. We show that counties with longer frontier history are more particularistic, displaying stronger opposition to federal taxes relative to state taxes, stronger communal values, less charitable giving to distant counties, and fewer online friendships with people in distant counties. At the same time, connections across counties display assortative matching on frontier history, highlighting the important role of culture in bridging disparate areas of the country. Overall, our results shed new light on moral values and the divergence of American and European individualism.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32433,32433,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024

Monetary Transmission Through Bank Securities Portfolios,"Daniel Greenwald, John Krainer & Pascal Paul","We study the transmission of monetary policy through bank securities portfolios using granular supervisory data on U.S. bank securities, hedging positions, and corporate credit. Banks that experienced larger losses on their securities during the 2022-2023 monetary tightening cycle extended less credit to firms. This spillover effect was stronger for available-for-sale securities, unhedged securities, and banks that must include unrealized gains and losses in their regulatory capital. A structural model, disciplined by our cross-sectional regression estimates, shows that interest rate transmission is stronger the more banks are required to adjust their regulatory capital for unrealized value changes of securities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32449,32449,24-May,NBER,5/13/2024
Can Discount Window Stigma Be Cured? An Experimental Investigation,Olivier Armantier and Charles Holt,"A core responsibility of a central bank is to ensure financial stability by acting as the “lender of last resort” through its Discount Window. The Discount Window, however, has not been effective because its usage is stigmatized. In this paper, we study experimentally how such stigma can be cured. We find that, once a Discount Window facility is stigmatized, removing stigma is difficult. This result is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s experiences which have been unsuccessful at removing the stigma associated with its Discount Window.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1103,1103,5/13/2024,FED-NEWYORK,5/13/2024
Is There Too Little Antitrust Enforcement in the US Hospital Sector?,"Zarek Brot-Goldberg, Zack Cooper, Stuart V. Craig, Lev Klarnet","From 2002 to 2020, there were over 1,000 mergers of US hospitals. During this period, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took enforcement actions against 13 transactions. However, using the FTC’s standard screening tools, we find that 20% of these mergers could have been predicted to meaningfully lessen competition. We then show that, from 2010 to 2015, predictably anticompetitive mergers resulted in price increases over 5%. We estimate that approximately half of predictably anticompetitive mergers had to be reported to the FTC per the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

What Went Wrong with Federal Student Loans?,"Adam Looney, Constantine Yannelis","At a time when the returns to college and graduate school are at historic highs, why do so many students struggle with their student loans? The increase in aggregate student debt and the struggles of today’s student loan borrowers can be traced to changes in federal policies intended to broaden access to federal aid and educational opportunities, and which increased enrollment and borrowing in higher-risk circumstances. Starting in the late 1990s, policymakers weakened regulations that had constrained institutions from enrolling aid-dependent students. This led to rising enrollment of relatively disadvantaged students, but primarily at poor-performing, low-value institutions whose students systematically failed to complete a degree, struggled to repay their loans, defaulted at high rates, and foundered in the job market. As these new borrowers experienced similarly poor outcomes, their loans piled up, loan performance deteriorated, and with it the finances of the federal program. The crisis illustrates the important role that educational institutions play in access to postsecondary education and student outcomes, and difficulty of using broadly-available loans to subsidize investments in education when there is so much heterogeneity in outcomes across institutions and programs and in the ability to repay of students.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/what-went-wrong-with-federal-student-loans/,2024-60,13-May-24,BFI,5/14/2024
Inflation and Trading,"Philip Schnorpfeil, Michael Weber, Andreas Hackethal","We study how investors respond to inflation combining a customized survey experiment with trading data at a time of historically high inflation. Investors’ beliefs about the stock return-inflation relation are very heterogeneous in the cross section and on average too optimistic. Moreover, many investors appear unaware of inflation-hedging strategies despite being otherwise well-informed about inflation and asset returns. Consequently, whereas exogenous shifts in inflation expectations do not impact return expectations, information on past returns during periods of high inflation leads to negative updating about the perceived stock-return impact of inflation, which feed into return expectations and subsequent actual trading behavior.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/inflation-and-trading/,2024-61,13-May-24,BFI,5/14/2024
Personal Tax Changes and Financial Well-being: Evidence from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,"Christine L. Dobridge, Joanne Hsu, and Mike Zabek","We estimate the effects of personal income tax decreases on financial well-being, including qualitative subjective assessments and quantitative measures. A plausibly causal design shows that tax decreases in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made survey respondents more likely to say they were “living comfortably” financially, with null effects at lower levels of subjective financial well-being. Estimates from a similar design using credit bureau data show that people who had larger tax decreases were modestly more likely to open new accounts, and more likely to have higher consumer credit balances. Tax decreases had effects on credit scores that are indistinguishable from zero.

Stress testing with multiple scenarios: a tale on tails and reverse stress scenarios,"David Aikman, Romain Angotti, Katarzyna Budnik","This paper proposes an operational approach to stress testing, allowing one to assess the banking sector’s vulnerability in multiple plausible macro-financial scenarios. The approach helps identify macro-financial risk factors of particular relevance for the banking system and individual banks and searches for scenarios that could push them towards their worst outcomes. We demonstrate this concept using a macroprudential stress testing model for the euro area. By doing so, we show how multiple-scenario stress testing can complement single-scenario stress tests, aid in scenario design, and evaluate risks in the banking system.

Time-varying Persistence of House Price Growth: The Role of Expectations and Credit Supply,"Chi-Young Choi, Alexander Chudik and Aaron Smallwood","High persistence is a prominent feature of price movements in U.S. housing markets, i.e., house prices grow faster this period if they grew faster last period. This paper provides two additional new insights to the literature on U.S. house price movements. First, there exists a significant time variation in the persistence of house price growth, both at the national and city level. Second, there is considerable heterogeneity in the time-varying persistence across different regions, particularly in areas that were historically less persistent, such as the capital-poor regions in the Midwest and South. This study conducts additional regression analyses to determine the main factor behind the time-varying persistence, with a particular focus on two housing demand factors: extrapolative expectations and credit supply expansion. Our results suggest that the time variation in the persistence of urban house price growth is better aligned with credit supply expansion than with extrapolative expectations.

Explaining the Life Cycle of Bank-Sponsored Money Market Mutual Funds: An Application of the Regulatory Dialectic,"Stefan A. Jacewitz, Jonathan Pogach, Haluk Unal and Chengjun Wu","In this paper, we present empirical evidence of the regulatory dialectic in the prime institutional money market fund (PI-MMF) industry. The regulatory dialectic describes how banks and regulators react to each other. For decades, a cap on commercial deposit interest rates fueled dramatic growth in bank-sponsored PI-MMFs as a form of shadow banking. During the growth period, banks with more commercial deposits were more likely to enter the PI-MMF industry in an effort to keep their commercial customers in affiliated subsidiaries. However, the 2008 crisis and subsequent regulatory changes halted the rapid growth of PI-MMFs. In the post-crisis regulatory regime, bank-sponsored funds were more likely to exit the industry than nonbank-sponsored funds. Simultaneously, the industry shifted from PI-MMFs to government institutional MMFs as substitute products.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/research-working-papers/explaining-the-life-cycle-of-bank-sponsored-money-market-mutual-funds-an-application-of-the-regulatory-dialectic/,5/7/2024,5/7/2024,FED-KANSASCITY,5/16/2024

Optimal Mortgage Refinancing with Inattention,"David W. Berger, Konstantin Milbradt, Fabrice Tourre, Joseph S. Vavra","We build a model of optimal fixed-rate mortgage refinancing with fixed costs and inattention and derive a new sufficient statistic that can be used to measure inattention frictions from simple moments of the rate gap distribution. In the model, borrowers pay attention to rates sporadically so they often fail to refinance even when it is profitable. When paying attention, borrowers optimally choose to refinance earlier than under a perfect attention benchmark. Our model can rationalize almost all errors of “omission” (refinancing too slowly) and a large fraction of the errors of “commission” (refinancing too quickly) previously documented in the data.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/optimal-mortgage-refinancing-with-inattention/,2024-63,15-May-24,BFI,5/17/2024
The globalization of climate change: amplification of climate-related physical risks through input-output linkages,"Stephan Fahr, Richard Senner, Andrea Vismara","While global supply chains have recently gained attention in the context of the Covid-related crisis as well as the war in Ukraine, their role in transmitting and amplifying climate-related physical risks across countries has received surprisingly little attention. To address this shortcoming, this paper for the first time combines country-level GDP losses due to climate-related physical risks with a global Input-Output model. More specifically, climate-related GDP-at-risk data are used to quantify the potential direct impact of physical risks on GDP at the country or regional level. This direct impact on GDP is then used to shock a global Input-Output (IO) model so that the propagation of the initial shock to country-sectors around the world becomes observable. The findings suggest that direct GDP loss estimates can severely underestimate the ultimate impact of physical risk because trade can lead to losses that are up to 30 times higher in the EA than what looking at the direct impacts would suggest. However, trade can also mitigate losses if substitutability across country-sectors is possible. Future research should (i) develop more granular, holistic, and forward-looking global physical risk data and (ii) examine more closely the role of both partially substitutable outputs, and critical outputs that are less substitutable or not substitutable at all, such as in the food sector.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2942~6734242a0b.en.pdf?8d66843513aca4a99c0ba6ee039902da,2942,17-May-24,ECB,5/17/2024

Dominant currency pricing transition,"Marco Garofalo, Giovanni Rosso and Roger Vicquéry","We study a unique episode of aggregate transition to dominant currency pricing: the dollarisation of UK exports in the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit referendum. Following the 2016 depreciation of the pound, the share of non‑EU UK exports invoiced in the UK domestic currency decreased sharply by more than 20 percentage points. This was mirrored by an increase of similar magnitude in the share of US dollar invoicing, which by 2019 overtook the pound as the main non‑EU export invoicing currency. Relying on transaction‑level data on the universe of UK trade and employing shift‑share and event‑study identification strategies, we show that large foreign‑exchange movements can generate an aggregate transition in invoicing choices. This is driven by firms with low levels of operational hedging, that is whose exports are not denominated in the same currency as their import. We find that this currency‑mismatch valuation channel accounts for most of the transition to dollar pricing, above and beyond effects from strategic complementarities and market power. Finally, we show that such a shift in export pricing has important aggregate consequences for export pass‑through and the allocative effects of price rigidities: a US$ appreciation depresses demand for UK exports by twice as much than before this ‘dominant currency pricing transition’.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/dominant-currency-pricing-transition,1074,"Fri, 17 May 2024 ",BOE,5/18/2024

LASH risk and interest rates,"Laura Alfaro, Saleem Bahaj, Robert Czech, Jonathon Hazell and Ioana Neamțu","We introduce a framework to understand and quantify a form of liquidity risk that we dub Liquidity After Solvency Hedging or ‘LASH’ risk. Financial institutions take LASH risk when they hedge against losses, using strategies that lead to liquidity needs when the value of the hedge falls, even as solvency improves. We focus on LASH risk relating to interest rate movements. Our framework implies that institutions with longer duration liabilities than assets – eg pension funds and insurers – take more LASH risk as interest rates fall, because solvency concerns rise in a low rate environment. Using UK regulatory data from 2019–22 on the universe of sterling repo and swap transactions, we measure, in real time and at the institution level, LASH risk for the non‑bank sector. We find that at peak LASH risk, a 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have led to liquidity needs close to the cash holdings of the pension fund and insurance sector. Using a cross‑sectional identification strategy, we find that low interest rates caused increases in LASH risk. We then find that the pre‑crisis LASH risk of non‑banks predicts their bond sales during the September 2022 LDI crisis, contributing to the yield spike in the bond market.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/lash-risk-and-interest-rates,1073,"Fri, 17 May 2024 ",BOE,5/18/2024
A Framework for Systemwide Liquidity Analysis,Xiaodan Ding ; Dimitrios Laliotis ; Priscilla Toffano,"We developed a novel Systemwide Liquidity (SWL) framework to identify liquidity stress in the system that goes beyond banks and to assess the role played by non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) in episodes of liquidity stress. The framework, which complements standard liquidity and interconnectedness analyses, traces the flow of liquidity among various agents in the economy and explores possible transmission channels and amplification mechanisms of correlated liquidity shocks. The framework uses unique balance sheet and asset encumbrance data to demonstrate the importance of assessing liquidity at the system level by allowing for (i) analyses of each agent’s contribution to liquidity stress, (ii) analyses of the impact of different behavioral assumptions (e.g., pecking order of collateral utilization, negative externalities of fire-sales and margin positions), and (iii) policy simulations. Since this framework covers a comprehensive set of financial instruments and transactions, it paves the way for harmonization of systemwide liquidity analysis across countries. We applied this general framework to Mexico in the context of the FSAP. Results for Mexico show that commercial banks safeguard the resiliency of the financial system by backstopping the liquidity needs of other agents. Moreover, certain sectors appear more vulnerable when binding regulatory liquidity constraints trigger risk-averse behavioral responses.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/05/17/A-Framework-for-Systemwide-Liquidity-Analysis-549171,2024-104,"Fri, 17 May 2024 ",IMF,5/18/2024
Echoes Across Borders: Macroeconomic Spillover Effects of Conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa,Hany Abdel-Latif ; Antonio David ; Rasmané Ouedraogo ; Markus Specht,"This paper quantifies the macroeconomic spillover effects of conflict within sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries using a new Conflict Spillover Index (CSI), which accounts for conflict intensity and distance from conflict-affected countries. Our findings reveal an escalation in conflict spillovers across SSA since 2011, marked by considerable cross-country heterogeneity. Impulse responses show that conflict spillovers shocks significantly and persistently hinder economic growth, while concurrently elevating inflation in the “home” country. Conflict spillover shocks are also associated with increases in (current) government spending and government debt. Furthermore, the international trade transmission channel of spillovers operates mostly through increased imports, while negative effects on FDI winddown over time. Moreover, state-dependent impulse responses underscore the importance of good governance, fiscal space, and foreign aid in attenuating the adverse macroeconomic spillover effects of conflict. The detrimental impact of conflict on output is more severe in environments with weaker governance and limited fiscal space. Government expenditures tend to rise following a spillover shock in contexts of high governmental effectiveness, possibly reflecting the use of policy buffers to respond to shocks. In that context, the papers shed light on important factors to promote resilience in SSA economies.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/05/17/Echoes-Across-Borders-Macroeconomic-Spillover-Effects-of-Conflict-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa-549159,2024-100,"Fri, 17 May 2024 ",IMF,5/18/2024
EMDE Central Bank Interventions during COVID-19 to Support Market Functioning,Kelly Eckhold ; Julia Faltermeier ; Darryl King ; Istvan Mak ; Dmitri Petrov,"This paper examines emerging market and developing economy (EMDE) central bank interventions to maintain financial stability during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The focus is on the functioning of the financial markets that are key to maintaining financial stability—money, securities, and FX funding markets. Several lessons emerge, including: (i) objectives should be well-specified and communicated to facilitate eventual exit; (ii) intervention triggers should prioritize liquidity metrics over prices; (iii) actions should be sufficiently large to address market dysfunction; (iv) the risks of fiscal dominance and moral hazard should be minimized; and (v) program design should incentivize self-liquidation by appropriate pricing or through short-term operations that quickly liquidate.

In response to market demand there has been a notable shift towards greater focus on the E pillar against growing heterogeneity on climate and environmental considerations across ESG providers.

New Perspectives on Quantitative Easing and Central Bank Capital Policies,Tobias Adrian ; Christopher J. Erceg ; Marcin Kolasa ; Jesper Lindé ; Roger McLeod ; Romain M Veyrune ; Pawel Zabczyk,"Central banks have come under increasing criticism for large balance sheet losses associated with quantitative easing (QE), and some observers have also argued that QE helped fuel the post-COVID-19 inflation boom. In this paper, we reconsider the conditions under which QE may be warranted considering the recent high inflation experience. We emphasize that the merits of QE should be evaluated based on the macroeconomic stimulus it provides and its effects on the consolidated fiscal position, and not simply on central bank profits or losses. Using an open economy DSGE model with segmented asset markets, we show how QE can provide a sizeable boost to output and inflation in a deep recession and improve the consolidated fiscal position—even if the central bank experiences considerable losses. However, the commitment-based features of QE and the possibility that upside inflation risks are bigger than recognized pre-pandemic call for more caution in using QE closer to full employment. We then consider how central banks might modify their policies for allocating profits to the government in light of large-scale losses. In short, we suggest that a more forward-looking and risk-based approach may be desirable in helping protect central bank financial autonomy and ultimately independence.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/05/17/New-Perspectives-on-Quantitative-Easing-and-Central-Bank-Capital-Policies-549168,2024-103,"Fri, 17 May 2024 ",IMF,5/18/2024
"Interest Groups, Ideology, and Indirect Lobbying: The Rise of Private Health Insurance In the United States","Marcella Alsan, Yousra Neberai & Xingyou Ye","This study examines the rise of private health insurance in the United States in the post- World War II era. We investigate the role of the American Medical Association (AMA) which financed a campaign against National Health Insurance that was directed by the country’s first political public relations firm, Whitaker & Baxter’s (WB) Campaigns, Inc. The AMA-WB Campaign had two key components: (1) physician outreach to patients and civic organizations; and (2) mass advertising that tied private insurance to “freedom” and “the American way.” We bring together archival data from several novel sources documenting Campaign intensity. We find a one standard deviation increase in Campaign exposure explains about 20% of the increase in private health insurance enrollment and a similar decline in public opinion support for legislation enacting National Health Insurance. We also find suggestive evidence that the Campaign altered the narrative for how legislators and pollsters described health insurance. These findings suggest the rise of private health insurance in the U.S. was not solely due to wartime wage freezes, collective bargaining, or favorable tax treatment. Rather, it was also enabled by an interest group-financed Campaign that used ideology to influence the behavior and views of ordinary citizens.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32484,32484,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Shaping Inequality and Intergenerational Persistence of Poverty: Free College or Better Schools,"Dirk Krueger, Alexander Ludwig & Irina Popova","We evaluate the aggregate, distributional and welfare consequences of alternative government education policies to encourage college completion, such as making college free and improving funding for public schooling. To do so, we construct a general equilibrium overlapping generations model with intergenerational linkages, a higher education choice as well as a multi-stage human capital production process during childhood and adolescence with parental and government schooling investments. The model features rich cross-sectional heterogeneity, distinguishes between single and married parents, and is disciplined by US household survey data on income, wealth, education and time use. Studying the transitions induced by unexpected policy reforms we show that the “free college” and the “better schools” reform generate significant welfare gains, which take time to materialize and are lower in general than in partial equilibrium. It is optimal to combine both reforms: tuition subsidies make college affordable even for children from poorer parental backgrounds and better schools increase human capital thereby reducing dropout risk.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32467,32467,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
What Drives Investors' Portfolio Choices?

We use this quasi-experiment to estimate a life cycle model and find a relative risk aversion of 2, EIS of 0.4, and $200 portfolio adjustment cost.

"Impact of Retail CBDC on Digital Payments, and Bank Deposits: Evidence from India","Marco Di Maggio, Pulak Ghosh, Soumya Kanti Ghosh & Andrew Wu","Interest in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) has been burgeoning with 134 countries now exploring its implementation. In December 2022, India started its CBDC pilot program to continue its transition towards a digitized payments economy. This paper presents the first empirical analysis utilizing detailed transaction data to explore the dynamics between CBDCs and existing digital payment methods, as well as the implications of increased CBDC usage on traditional bank deposits. Our findings reveal that policies which increase transaction costs for current digital payment methods catalyze a substitution effect, bolstering CBDC adoption. Furthermore, an uptick in CBDC usage is associated with a notable decline in bank, cash, and savings deposits, suggesting potential paths to bank disintermediation. This study contributes critical insights into the evolving competition between digital currencies and established financial infrastructures, highlighting the transformative potential of CBDCs on the broader economy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32457,32457,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Paper Tiger? Chinese Science and Home Bias in Citations,"Shumin Qiu, Claudia Steinwender & Pierre Azoulay","We investigate the phenomenon of home bias in scientific citations, where researchers disproportionately cite work from their own country. We develop a benchmark for expected citations based on the relative size of countries, defining home bias as deviations from this norm. Our findings reveal that China exhibits the largest home bias across all major countries and in nearly all scientific fields studied. This stands in contrast to the pattern of home bias for China’s trade in goods and services, where China does not stand out from most industrialized countries. After adjusting citation counts for home bias, we demonstrate that China’s apparent rise in citation rankings is overstated. Our adjusted ranking places China fourth globally, behind the US, the UK, and Germany, tempering the perception of China’s scientific dominance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32468,32468,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Dynamic Efficiency and Pricing of Innovations with Insurance: The Case for Gene Therapies,Anirban Basu,"I demonstrate that to achieve dynamic efficiency, the optimal share of total surplus that a social payer should transfer to an innovating industry for a current asset depends on the marginal product of investment and the share of profits invested by the industry on the current asset and not on returns from future innovations. This insight arises from using a dynamic multi-period model of optimal transfers rather than a static two-period model with one optimal transfer, as used in the literature. I delve into the implications for alternative pricing of healthcare innovations - value-based prices using cost-effectiveness analysis, monopoly prices under the social demand curve, and monopoly profit preserving prices under insurance – for surplus appropriation by the innovating industry.   I also explore how alternative financing mechanisms used by social payers and the demand uncertainty that innovators face impact this appropriation share. I illustrate these concepts with a substantive example of pricing gene therapy for sickle cell disease in the United States",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32480,32480,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
"Old Moats for New Models: Openness, Control, and Competition in Generative AI","Pierre Azoulay, Joshua L. Krieger & Abhishek Nagaraj","Drawing insights from the field of innovation economics, we discuss the likely competitive environment shaping generative AI advances. Central to our analysis are the concepts of appropriability—whether firms in the industry are able to control the knowledge generated by their innovations—and complementary assets—whether effective entry requires access to specialized infrastructure and capabilities to which incumbent firms can ration access. While the rapid improvements in AI foundation models promise transformative impacts across broad sectors of the economy, we argue that tight control over complementary assets will likely result in a concentrated market structure, as in past episodes of technological upheaval. We suggest the likely paths through which incumbent firms may restrict entry, confining newcomers to subordinate roles and stifling broad sectoral innovation. We conclude with speculations regarding how this oligopolistic future might be averted. Policy interventions aimed at fractionalizing or facilitating shared access to complementary assets might help preserve competition and incentives for extending the generative AI frontier. Ironically, the best hopes for a vibrant open source AI ecosystem might rest on the presence of a “rogue” technology giant, who might choose openness and engagement with smaller firms as a strategic weapon wielded against other incumbents.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32474,32474,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Global Indeterminacy in HANK Economies,Sushant Acharya & Jess Benhabib,"We show that in Heterogeneous-Agent New-Keynesian (HANK) economies with countercyclical risk the natural interest rate is endogenous and co-moves with output, leaving the economy susceptible to self-fulfilling fluctuations. Unlike in Representative-Agent New-Keynesian models, the Taylor principle is not sufficient to guarantee uniqueness of equilibrium in HANK if risk is even mildly countercyclical. In fact, we prove that multiple bounded-equilibria exist, no matter how strongly monetary policy responds to changes in inflation. Neither inertial rules nor rules which respond to output-gap fluctuations can resolve this indeterminacy. Instead, to implement a unique equilibrium, policy must stabilize endogenous natural rate fluctuations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32462,32462,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Dynamic Collective Action and the Power of Large Numbers,Marco Battaglini & Thomas R. Palfrey,"Collective action is a dynamic process where individuals in a group assess over time the benefits and costs of participating toward the success of a collective goal. Early participation improves the expectation of success and thus stimulates the subsequent participation of other individuals who might otherwise be unwilling to engage. On the other hand, a slow start can depress expectations and lead to failure for the group. Individuals have an incentive to procrastinate, not only in the hope of free riding, but also in order to observe the flow of participation by others, which allows them to better gauge whether their own participation will be useful or simply wasted. How do these phenomena affect the probability of success for a group? As the size of the group increases, will a “power of large numbers” prevail producing successful outcomes, or will a “curse of large numbers” lead to failure? In this paper, we address these questions by studying a dynamic collective action problem in which n individuals can achieve a collective goal if a share of them takes a costly action (e.g., participate in a protest, join a picket line, or sign an environmental agreement). Individuals have privately known participation costs and decide over time if and when to participate. We characterize the equilibria of this game and show that under general conditions the eventual success of collective action is necessarily probabilistic. The process starts for sure, and hence there is always a positive probability of success; however, the process “gets stuck” with positive probability, in the sense that participation stops short of the goal. Equilibrium outcomes have a simple characterization in large populations: welfare converges to either full efficiency or zero as n→∞ depending on a precise condition on the rate at which the share required for success converges to zero. Whether success is achievable or not, delays are always irrelevant: in the limit, success is achieved either instantly or never.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32473,32473,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Can Gun Violence be Deterred at Low Cost? Evidence from a Randomized Experiment in New York City,"Oludamilare Aboaba, Aaron Chalfin, Michael LaForest Tucker, Lucie Parker & Patrick Sharkey",Can gun violence be deterred at low cost? We report the results of a randomized experiment of a messaging intervention which was designed to reduce gun violence among individuals under parole supervision with a prior violent felony conviction or firearm arrest. The intervention consisted of a group meeting in which high-risk paroled individuals were notified of the sanction they would face upon reoffending while being offered community resources to support re- integration into the community. The program did not lead to a reduction in gun violence or create community spillover effects but did reduce parole violations by 15%. Potential mechanisms and implications for similar programs are discussed.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w32455,32455,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Fiscal Consequences of Central Bank Losses,Stephen G. Cecchetti & Jens Hilscher,"In response to the Global Financial Crisis, central banks engaged in large-scale asset purchases funded by the issuance of reserves. These “unconventional” policies continued during the pandemic, so that by 2022 central banks’ balance sheets had grown up to ten-fold. As a result of rapidly increasing interest rates, these massive portfolios began producing substantial losses. We interpret these losses as fiscal policy consequences of quantitative easing and stress that they must be balanced against the prior benefits of implementing purchase policies. Importantly, losses differ qualitatively depending on whether the central bank chooses to buy domestic or foreign assets, thus resulting in transfers either within or between countries. Effects of losses may differ due to accounting rules (when losses are realized) and when the fiscal authority compensates for losses (the structure of indemnification agreements). Data from the Federal Reserve, the Eurosystem, and the Bank of England show that maximum annual losses are between 0.3 and 1.5 percent of GDP. By contrast, the Swiss National Bank is sustaining losses up to 17 percent of GDP.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32478,32478,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
(Pro-) Social Learning and Strategic Disclosure,Roland Bénabou & Nikhil Vellodi,"We study a sequential experimentation model with endogenous feedback. Agents choose between a safe and risky action, the latter generating stochastic rewards. When making this choice, each agent is selfishly motivated (myopic). However, agents can disclose their experiences to a public record, and when doing so are pro-socially motivated (forward-looking). When prior uncertainty is large, disclosure is both polarized (only extreme signals are disclosed) and positively biased (no feedback is bad news). When prior uncertainty is small, a novel form of unraveling occurs and disclosure is complete. Subsidizing disclosure costs can perversely lead to less disclosure but more experimentation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32483,32483,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Inflation and Trading,"Philip Schnorpfeil, Michael Weber & Andreas Hackethal","We study how investors respond to inflation combining a customized survey experiment with trading data at a time of historically high inflation. Investors' beliefs about the stock return-inflation relation are very heterogeneous in the cross section and on average too optimistic. Moreover, many investors appear unaware of inflation-hedging strategies despite being otherwise well-informed about inflation and asset returns. Consequently, whereas exogenous shifts in inflation expectations do not impact return expectations, information on past returns during periods of high inflation leads to negative updating about the perceived stock-return impact of inflation, which feeds into return expectations and subsequent actual trading behavior.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32470,32470,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
"Credit, Land Speculation, and Long-Run Economic Growth",Tomohiro Hirano & Joseph E. Stiglitz,"This paper analyses the impact of credit expansions arising from increases in collateral values or lower interest rate policies on long-run productivity and economic growth in a two-sector endogenous growth economy with credit frictions, with the driver of growth lying in one sector (manufacturing) but not in the other (real estate). We show that it is not so much aggregate credit expansion that matters for long-run productivity and economic growth but sectoral credit expansions. Credit expansions associated mainly with relaxation of real estate financing (capital investment financing) will be productivity-and growth-retarding (enhancing). Without financial regulations, low interest rates and more expansionary monetary policy may so encourage land speculation using leverage that productive capital investment and economic growth are decreased. Unlike in standard macroeconomic models, in ours, the equilibrium price of land will be finite even if the safe rate of interest is less than the rate of output growth.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32479,32479,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
A Flexible Model of Food Security: Estimation and Implications for Prediction,"Will Davis, Jose O. Xilau, Rusty Tchernis & Christian A. Gregory","We propose a novel Bayesian Graded Response Model (BGRM) for food security measurement. Our BGRM has several attractive features. It produces continuous food security estimates and measures of estimation uncertainty at the household level. Unlike the USDA’s official measurement model, the BGRM can be used with binary and polytomous items. We further modify our BGRM to include any combination of binary, ordered polytomous, and continuous variables. With data from the 2017-18 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we estimate our BGRM for responses to the 10 adult core Food Security Module (FSM) questions. We find substantial uncertainty in household-level estimates, emphasizing the inherent uncertainty of latent trait estimation. We observe overlap in BGRM estimates across USDA-defined food security categories and significant variation within categories. We estimate our model using Current Population Survey (CPS) data as a robustness check. CPS results are qualitatively similar to those from the NHANES, highlighting possible implications for national USDA food security estimates. We explore the BGRM’s ability to explain variations in health outcomes associated with food security and compare results to those produced using standard USDA category definitions. Finally, we demonstrate the BGRM’s flexibility by incorporating an additional continuous variable, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), into the model, capturing nutrition quality and food security information in a novel latent construct. The adaptability of our BGRM positions it as a versatile tool for measuring food security and other latent traits requiring a diverse range of variable types like nutrition security.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32460,32460,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Voluntary Emission Restraints in Developing Economies: The Role of Trade Policy,"Lorenzo Caliendo, Marcelo Dolabella, Mauricio Moreira, Matthew Murillo & Fernando Parro","We study the role of trade policy in one of the most pressing climate policy challenges that developing countries face: meeting voluntary emission restraints (VERs). To do so, we develop a general equilibrium trade model that extends Caliendo and Parro (2015) in three dimensions. First, we model extractive sectors that feature a continuum of producers with heterogeneous productivity, demanding labor, dirty natural resources, and intermediate goods from all industries. Second, we consider that production generates different amounts of emissions across sectors and countries, and households experience disutility from carbon emissions, modeled as a pure externality as in Shapiro (2021). Third, we model a general set of taxes along the value chain—on production, intermediate and final consumption, and on labor—which allows for different options of carbon taxes and tariffs that impact emissions and other outcomes in general equilibrium. In our quantitative analysis, we focus on two groups of policies: those that are in the traditional realm of trade policy, related to tariff reform and potential emission biases; and those that combine a Pigouvian carbon tax with border adjustments. Our main findings point to a nuanced role of trade policy as a climate policy in developing economies. Although it is effective in mitigating emission leakages, such leakages are small in magnitude, and border adjustment tariffs have collateral effects in terms of trade declines, and in many countries, welfare losses. These findings contrast with the implications of climate policy in large economies, where emission leakages are much more significant and the impact on trade less costly. Our main results also indicate that carbon taxes and tariffs will not be enough for most developing countries to meet their net-zero emission targets dictated by the VERs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32459,32459,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
"Unions, wages and hours",David G. Blanchflower & Alex Bryson,"We examine union-non-union differentials in wages and hours in the United States over the last 50 years using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS).  The regression-adjusted difference between union members’ and non-members’ hourly earnings has been falling since the Great Recession.  The union differential in weekly wages has been more stable.  Although it fell by around 5 log points during COVID it remains 15 log points.  This weekly earnings differential arises from both a higher hourly wage of around 10 log points and longer working hours (5 log points).  The working hours differential partly reflects unions’ ability to tackle under-employment, such that union workers work closer to the hours they desire than their non-union counterparts.  The traditional focus on hourly wage differentials underplays the important role trade unions play in maintaining members’ weekly earnings by ensuring workers receive the paid hours they desire.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32471,32471,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Inflation's Impact on American Households,"David Altig, Alan J. Auerbach, Erin F. Eidschun, Laurence J. Kotlikoff & Victor Yifan Ye","The post-COVID price surge has reignited interest in inflation’s impact on American households. Even if anticipated and with full market adjustments, inflation affects households through its interaction with the fiscal system, which is the focus of this paper. Inflation affects households through its interaction with the fiscal. We run the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), assuming different inflation rates, through the Fiscal Analyzer (TFA) – a life cycle, consumption-smoothing tool incorporating all major federal and state fiscal programs. Before doing so, we adjust the SCF data to neutralize inflation’s non-fiscal effects. A permanent increase in the inflation rate from zero to 10 percent reduces median lifetime spending by 6.82 percent. This impact is smaller – 4.74 percent – when fiscal COLAs aren’t lagged. But the big stories are the progressivity of inflation’s increase in net taxation, its age pattern, and its heterogeneity. The 15.9 percent median lifetime spending loss of the top 1 percent from 10 percent inflation is roughly 2.5 times that of the bottom quintile. Middle aged households are hit far harder because they have more asset income, which, with inflation, is taxed at a higher effective rate. The 25th percentile of spending changes is a reduction of 9.84 percent. The 75th percentile change is still a reduction of 4.83 percent. The maximum spending decline (increase) across all households is 64.9 (46.7) percent. Thus, the distribution of welfare is highly sensitive to significant, ongoing inflation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32482,32482,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
What Went Wrong with Federal Student Loans?,Adam Looney & Constantine Yannelis,"At a time when the returns to college and graduate school are at historic highs, why do so many students struggle with their student loans? The increase in aggregate student debt and the struggles of today’s student loan borrowers can be traced to changes in federal policies intended to broaden access to federal aid and educational opportunities, and which increased enrollment and borrowing in higher-risk circumstances. Starting in the late 1990s, policymakers weakened regulations that had constrained institutions from enrolling aid-dependent students. This led to rising enrollment of relatively disadvantaged students, but primarily at poor-performing, low-value institutions whose students systematically failed to complete a degree, struggled to repay their loans, defaulted at high rates, and foundered in the job market. As these new borrowers experienced similarly poor outcomes, their loans piled up, loan performance deteriorated, and with it the finances of the federal program. The crisis illustrates the important role that educational institutions play in access to postsecondary education and student outcomes, and difficulty of using broadly-available loans to subsidize investments in education when there is so much heterogeneity in outcomes across institutions and programs and in the ability to repay of students.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32469,32469,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
A Sharp Test for the Judge Leniency Design,"Mohamed Coulibaly, Yu-Chin Hsu, Ismael Mourifié & Yuanyuan Wan","We propose a new specification test to assess the validity of the judge leniency design. We characterize a set of sharp testable implications, which exploit all the relevant information in the observed data distribution to detect violations of the judge leniency design assumptions. The proposed sharp test is asymptotically valid and consistent and will not make discordant recommendations. When the judge’s leniency design assumptions are rejected, we propose a way to salvage the model using partial monotonicity and exclusion assumptions, under which a variant of the Local Instrumental Variable (LIV) estimand can recover the Marginal Treatment Effect. Simulation studies show our test outperforms existing non-sharp tests by significant margins. We apply our test to assess the validity of the judge leniency design using data from Stevenson (2018), and it rejects the validity for three crime categories: robbery, drug selling, and drug possession.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32456,32456,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Designing Dynamic Reassignment Mechanisms: Evidence from GP Allocation,"Ingrid Huitfeldt, Victoria Marone & Daniel C. Waldinger","Many centralized assignment systems seek to not only provide good matches for participants’ current needs, but also to accommodate changes in preferences and circumstances. We study the problem of designing a dynamic reassignment mechanism in the context of Norway’s system for allocating patients to general practitioners (GPs). We provide direct evidence of misallocation under the current system––patients sitting on waitlists for each others’ GPs, but who cannot trade––and analyze an alternative mechanism that adapts the Top-Trading Cycles (TTC) algorithm to a dynamic environment. In contrast to the static case, dynamic TTC may leave some agents worse off relative to a status quo where trades are not permitted, introducing novel concerns about fairness. We empirically evaluate how this mechanism would perform by estimating a structural model of switching behavior and GP choice. While introducing TTC would on average reduce waiting times and increase patient welfare––with especially large benefits for female patients and recent movers––patients endowed with undesirable GPs would be harmed. Adjustments to the priority system can avoid harming this group while preserving most of the gains from TTC.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32458,32458,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Shrinking the Term Structure,"Damir Filipović, Markus Pelger & Ye Ye","We propose a new framework to explain the factor structure in the full cross section of Treasury bond returns. Our method unifies non-parametric curve estimation with cross-sectional factor modeling. We identify smoothness as a fundamental principle of the term structure of returns. Our approach implies investable factors, which correspond to the optimal spanning basis functions in decreasing order of smoothness. Our factors explain the slope and curvature shapes frequently encountered in PCA. In a comprehensive empirical study, we show that the first four factors explain the time-series variation and risk premia of the term structure of excess returns. Cash flows are covariances as the exposure of bonds to factors is fully explained by cash flow information. We identify a state-dependent complexity premium. The fourth factor, which captures complex shapes of the term structure premium, substantially reduces pricing errors and pays off during recessions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32472,32472,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024

The effect is stronger for entry-level and junior positions, indicating a disproportionate impact on newcomers to the workforce.

Wage Insurance for Displaced Workers,"Benjamin G. Hyman, Brian K. Kovak & Adam Leive",Wage insurance provides income support to displaced workers who find reemployment at a lower wage. We analyze wage insurance in the context of the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program by merging linked employer-employee Census data to TAA petitions and leveraging a discontinuity in eligibility based on worker age. Wage insurance eligibility increases short-run employment probabilities and leads to higher long-run cumulative earnings. We find shorter non-employment durations largely drive increased long-term earnings among workers eligible for wage insurance. Our results are quantitatively consistent with a standard non-stationary partial equilibrium search model. The program is self-financing even under conservative assumptions.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w32464,32464,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024
Gendered Change: 150 Years of Transformation in US Hours,"L. Rachel Ngai, Claudia Olivetti & Barbara Petrongolo","Women's contribution to the economy has been markedly underestimated in predominantly agricultural societies, due to their widespread involvement in unpaid agricultural work. Combining data from the US Census and several early sources, we create a consistent measure of male and female employment and hours for the US for 1870-2019, including paid work and unpaid work in family farms and non-farm businesses. The resulting measure of hours traces a U-shape for women, with a modest decline up to mid-20th century followed by a sustained increase, and a monotonic decline for men. We propose a multisector economy with uneven productivity growth, income effects, and consumption complementarity across sectoral outputs. During early development stages, declining agriculture leads to rising services -- both in the market and the home -- and leisure, reducing market work for both genders. In later stages, structural transformation reallocates labor from manufacturing into services, while marketization reallocates labor from home to market services. Given gender comparative advantages, the first channel is more relevant for men, reducing male hours, while the second channel is more relevant for women, increasing female hours. Our quantitative illustration suggests that structural transformation and marketization can account for the overall decline in market hours from 1880-1950, and one quarter of the rise and decline, respectively, in female and male market hours from 1950-2019.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32475,32475,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024

There is No Excess Volatility Puzzle,"Andrew Atkeson, Jonathan Heathcote & Fabrizio Perri","We present two valuation models that we use to account for the annual data on price per share and dividends per share for the CRSP Value-Weighted Index from 1929-2023. We show that it is a simple matter to account for these data based purely on a model of variation in the expected ratio of dividends per share to aggregate consumption over time under two conditions. First, investors must receive news shocks regarding the expected ratio of dividends per share to aggregate consumption in the long run. Second, the discount rate used to evaluate the impact of this news on the current price per share must be low. We argue that both of these conditions are likely satisfied in the data. Because our valuation model reproduces the data on price per share and dividends per share exactly over this long time period, it also reproduces realized values of returns, dividend growth, the dividend-price ratio, and all Campbell-Shiller-style regression results involving these variables. Thus, we conclude that the answer to Shiller (1981)’s question “Do stock prices move too much to be justified by subsequent movements in dividends?” is No.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32481,32481,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024

Using difference-in-differences and event-study methodologies, we find that local racial protests improved credit access for Black business owners. Additionally, the increased social media and public attention following Floyd's death affected the public perception of racial equity issues, resulting in a positive moderating effect on the loan amounts distributed to Black owners relative to other racial-ethnic groups.

Estimating the Effects of Political Pressure on the Fed: A Narrative Approach with New Data,Thomas Drechsel,"This paper combines new data and a narrative approach to identify shocks to political pressure on the Federal Reserve. From archival records, I build a data set of personal interactions between U.S. Presidents and Fed officials between 1933 and 2016. Since personal interactions do not necessarily reflect political pressure, I develop a narrative identification strategy based on President Nixon's pressure on Fed Chair Burns. I exploit this narrative through restrictions on a structural vector autoregression that includes the personal interaction data. I find that political pressure shocks (i) increase inflation strongly and persistently, (ii) lead to statistically weak negative effects on activity, (iii) contributed to inflationary episodes outside of the Nixon era, and (iv) transmit differently from standard expansionary monetary policy shocks, by having a stronger effect on inflation expectations. Quantitatively, increasing political pressure by half as much as Nixon, for six months, raises the price level more than 8%.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32461,32461,24-May,NBER,5/20/2024

Using applications to ERA lotteries in four cities linked to survey and administrative data, we assess its impacts on housing stability, financial security, and mental health. We find that assistance increased rent payment modestly and improved mental health. However, in contrast to pre-pandemic studies of similar assistance programs, we find limited effects on financial or housing stability.

Sixty Years of Global Inflation: A Post-GFC Update,"Raphael Auer, Mathieu Pedemonte, Raphael S. Schoenle","Is inflation (still) a global phenomenon? We study the international co-movement of inflation based on a dynamic factor model and in a sample spanning up to 56 countries during the 1960-2023 period. Over the entire period, a first global factor explains approximately 58% of the variation in headline inflation across all countries and over 72% in OECD economies. The explanatory power of global inflation is equally high in a shorter sample spanning the time since 2000. Core inflation is also remarkably global, with 53% of its variation attributable to a first global factor. The explanatory power of a second global factor is lower, except for select emerging economies. Variables such as a broad dollar index, the US federal funds rate, and a measure of commodity prices positively correlate with the first global factor. This global factor is also correlated with US inflation during the 70s, 80s, the GFC, and COVID. However, it lags these variables during the post-COVID period.

The runs were driven by large (institutional) depositors, rather than many small (retail) depositors. While the runs were related to weak fundamentals, we find evidence for the importance of coordination because run banks were disproportionately publicly traded and many banks with similarly bad fundamentals did not suffer a run.

This paper is the first to document how flood risks relate not only to individual mortgage performance and underwriting, but also how flood risks correlate to MBS performance and structure. Across residential mortgages we find that defaults are concentrated among the most flood-prone properties and this risk is somewhat offset by larger down payments and slightly higher mortgage rates. Even when mortgages are combined into MBS’s, we show that average mortgage default within MBS’s increases with average flood risk and that higher flood risk is primarily offset by increased credit protection or subordination; a one unit increase in flood risk is associated with a 2.6 percent increase in subordination. Ultimately, our analysis suggests that flood risk is reflected in mortgage-level performance and pricing and is partially, but not fully, accounted for in MBS deal-level performance and structure.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/research-working-papers/flood-risk-exposures-and-mortgage-backed-security-asset-performance-and-risk-sharing/,2024-05,5/21/2024,FED-KANSASCITY,5/22/2024
Oil Price Fluctuations and US Banks,"Paolo Gelain, Marco Lorusso, Saeed Zaman","We document a sizable effect of oil price fluctuations on US banking variables by estimating an SVAR with sign restrictions as in Baumeister and Hamilton (2019). We find that oil market shocks that lead to a contraction in world economic activity unambiguously lower the amount of bank credit to the US economy, tend to decrease US banks' net worth, and tend to increase the US credit spread. The effects can be strong and long-lasting, or more modest and short-lived, depending on the source of the oil price fluctuations. The effects are stronger for smaller and lower leveraged banks.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2411-oil-price-fluctuations-and-us-banks,24-11,05.21.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,5/22/2024
Work from Home and Interstate Migration,"Alexander Bick, Adam Blandin, Karel Mertens, and Hannah Rubinton","Interstate migration by working-age adults in the US declined substantially during the Great Recession and remained subdued through 2019. We document that interstate migration rose sharply following the 2020 Covid-19 outbreak, nearly recovering to pre-Great recession levels, and provide evidence that this reversal was primarily driven by the rise in work from home (WFH). Before the pandemic, interstate migration by WFH workers was consistently 50% higher than for commuters. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, this migration gap persisted while the WFH share tripled. Using quasi-panel data and plausibly exogenous changes in employer WFH policies, we address concerns about omitted variables or reverse causality and conclude that access to WFH induces greater interstate migration. An aggregate accounting exercise suggests that over half of the rise in interstate migration since 2019 can be accounted for by the rise in the WFH share.  Moreover, both actual WFH and pre-pandemic WFH potential, based on occupation shares, can account for a sizable share of cross-state variation in migration.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-012,2024-012A,24-May,FED-STLOUIS,5/22/2024

Our main estimation strategy uses multi-unit firms and compares within-firm changes in outcomes for establishments in treated and untreated states.

Financial Statement Analysis with Large Language Models,"Alex Kim, Maximilian Muhn, Valeri Nikolaev","We investigate whether an LLM can successfully perform financial statement analysis in a way similar to a professional human analyst. We provide standardized and anonymous financial statements to GPT4 and instruct the model to analyze them to determine the direction of future earnings. Even without any narrative or industry-specific information, the LLM outperforms financial analysts in its ability to predict earnings changes. The LLM exhibits a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle. Furthermore, we find that the prediction accuracy of the LLM is on par with the performance of a narrowly trained state-of-the-art ML model. LLM prediction does not stem from its training memory. Instead, we find that the LLM generates useful narrative insights about a company’s future performance. Lastly, our trading strategies based on GPT’s predictions yield a higher Sharpe ratio and alphas than strategies based on other models.

To isolate this channel, we investigate the effect of US monetary policy surprises on the ratio of prices of the same stock listed simultaneously in Hong Kong and Mainland China, and thereby control for revisions in cash-ﬂow expectations. We ﬁnd this channel to be strong and asymmetric, with the effect driven by surprise monetary policy interest rate cuts.

Investment-Goods Market Power and Capital Accumulation,"Fabio Bertolotti, Andrea Lanteri, Alessandro Villa","We develop a model of capital accumulation in an open economy that imports investment goods from large foreign firms with market power. We model investment-goods producers as a dynamic oligopoly and characterize a Markov Perfect Equilibrium with a Generalized Euler Equation. We use this optimality condition to analyze the joint evolution of investment, prices, and markups. The markup on investment goods decreases as the economy accumulates capital toward its steady state, generating a state-dependent capital adjustment cost. We analyze the role of commitment to future production of investment goods for the dynamics of markups and investment. We use a calibrated version of the model to simulate the effects of shocks to the demand for durable goods and semiconductors during the post-2020 world recovery. Finally, we perform counterfactual analyses on the effects of expanding the production capacity. The model highlights the separate roles of increasing marginal costs—akin to capacity constraints—and market power.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-13,2024-13,24-May,FED-CHICAGO,5/24/2024
Evaluating the Effects of Geographic Adjustments on Poverty Measures Using Self-Reported Financial Well-Being Scores,Jeff Larrimore,"A central aspect of poverty measurement is how well the measure can identify the people and places that are experiencing financial hardships. This paper explores the relationship between poverty and financial hardship by using the CFPB’s financial well-being scale, which reflects individuals’ self-assessments of their financial challenges. Using this measure, for every 1 percentage point increase in a state’s official poverty rate for working-age adults, there is a 0.59 percentage point increase in the share of working-age adults with very low financial well-being. In contrast, the state’s supplemental poverty rate is negatively correlated with the rate of financial hardship using the CFPB measure. This finding is due to the supplemental poverty measure’s geographic adjustment shifting poverty towards areas that have lower rates of self-reported financial hardship.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/evaluating-the-effects-of-geographic-adjustments-on-poverty-measures-using-self-reported-financial-well-being-scores.htm,2024-030,24-May,FED-BOARD,5/25/2024

Examining Price-Wage Dynamics in a Small Open Economy the Case of Uruguay,Pau Rabanal ; M. Belen Sbrancia,"The recent increase of inflation globally has led to a renewed interest in understanding the link between inflation and wages. In Uruguay, the presence of centralized wage bargaining and indexation practices raises the question as to what extent wage growth dynamics can make the response of inflation to shocks more persistent. We use a medium-scale DSGE model which incorporates indexation in the wage setting equation to analyze the interactions between wage setting behavior and other macroeconomic variables, as well as the role of monetary policy. The analysis suggests that wage indexation increases the persistence of the response of inflation to domestic and foreign shocks, it also affects the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the severity of the trade-offs faced by the central bank.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/05/24/Examining-Price-Wage-Dynamics-in-a-Small-Open-Economy-the-Case-of-Uruguay-549485,2024-105,"Fri, 24 May 2024 ",IMF,5/25/2024

Exploring the Role of Public Expenditure in Advancing Female Economic Empowerment and Gender Equality,Charla Britt ; Danielle Egerer,"This paper discusses connections between female economic empowerment and government spending. It is an abbreviated overview for non-gender-experts on how fiscal expenditure may support female economic empowerment as an interim step toward advancing gender equality. From this perspective, it offers a preliminary exploration of key factors and indicators associated with gender-differentiated impacts in each of five main categories of public spending (education, health, capital expenditure, government employment and compensation, and social protection and labor market programs). It examines and proposes indices within each category that can be used to identify and measure related gender gaps and suggests associations and connections between those indices, public spending, and other available proxy measurements with some benchmarking potential which is summarized at the end of each category in a Gender Lens Matrix for ease of reference. The paper draws on an extensive literature review and examination of publicly available datasets. It also highlights and discusses gaps in data which limit gender analysis.

Hanging Out to Dry? Long-term Macroeconomic Effects of Drought in Fragile and Conflict-Affected States,Kalin I Tintchev ; Laura Jaramillo,"Using a comprehensive drought measure and a panel autoregressive distributed lag model, the paper finds that worsening drought conditions can result in long-term scarring of real GDP per capita growth and affect long-term price stability in Fragile and Conflict-Affected States (FCS), more so than in other countries, leaving them further behind. Lower crop productivity and slower investment are key channels through which drought impacts economic growth in FCS. In a high emissions scenario, drought conditions will cut 0.4 percentage points of FCS’ growth of real GDP per capita every year over the next 40 years and increase average inflation by 2 percentage points. Drought will also increase hunger in FCS, from alreay high levels. The confluence of lower food production and higher prices in a high emissions scenario would push 50 million more people in FCS into hunger. The macroeconomic effects of drought in FCS countries are amplified by their low copying capacity due to high public debt, low social spending, insufficient trade openness, high water insecurity, and weak governance.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/05/24/Hanging-Out-to-Dry-Long-term-Macroeconomic-Effects-of-Drought-in-Fragile-and-Conflict-549500,2024-106,"Fri, 24 May 2024 ",IMF,5/25/2024
The Effect of Inequality on Redistribution: An Econometric Analysis,"Michael J.

We identify exogenous income distribution changes and account for reverse causality using instruments based on exposure to international trade shocks, international commodity price shocks and national industry demand shocks, as well as lagged endogenous variables, with controls for the level of income, the business cycle and demographics. We find the degree of attenuation of market income shifts initially increases in quintile rank, peaks at the middle quintile and then falls for higher income quintiles, consistent with median voter political economy theory and what Stigler called Director’s Law. We also provide evidence of considerable and systematic spillover effects on quintiles neither gaining nor losing in the “experiments,” also favoring the middle quintile, what we label the greedy median voter. “Voting” and “income insurance” coalition analyses are presented.

Double Robustness of Local Projections and Some Unpleasant VARithmetic,"José Luis Montiel Olea, Mikkel Plagborg-Møller, Eric Qian & Christian K. Wolf","We consider impulse response inference in a locally misspecified stationary vector autoregression (VAR) model. The conventional local projection (LP) confidence interval has correct coverage even when the misspecification is so large that it can be detected with probability approaching 1. This follows from a “double robustness” property analogous to that of modern estimators for partially linear regressions. In contrast, VAR confidence intervals dramatically undercover even for misspecification so small that it is difficult to detect statistically and cannot be ruled out based on economic theory. This is because of a “no free lunch” result for VARs: the worst-case bias and coverage distortion are small if, and only if, the variance is close to that of LP. While VAR coverage can be restored by using a bias-aware critical value or a large lag length, the resulting confidence interval tends to be at least as wide as the LP interval.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32495,32495,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
Explaining Adverse Cholesterol Levels and Distinct Gender Patterns in an Indonesian Population Compared with the U.S.,"Ralph I. Lawton, Elizabeth Frankenberg, Teresa Seeman, Arun S. Karlamangla, Cecep Sumantri & Duncan Thomas","In order to shed light on the biological and social drivers underlying the dramatic rise in cardiovascular disease risk in lower-income settings, links between these risks and body composition, behavioral and socioeconomic factors in Aceh, Indonesia, are contrasted with the United States. We focus on rigorously-validated measures of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol among adults. Indonesians present with adverse cholesterol biomarkers relative to Americans, despite being younger and having lower body mass index. Adjusting for age, these gaps increase in magnitude. Body composition, behaviors, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics that affect cholesterol do not explain between-country HDL differences, but do explain non-HDL differences, after accounting for medication use. On average, gender differences are inconsistent across the two countries and persist after controlling observed characteristics. Leveraging the richness of the Indonesian data to draw comparisons between males and females within the same household, the gender gaps among Indonesians are not explained for HDL cholesterol, but attenuated substantially for non-HDL cholesterol. This finding suggests that unmeasured household resources play an important role in determining non-HDL cholesterol. More generally, they appear to be affected by social and biological forces in complex ways that differ across countries and potentially operate differently for HDL and non-HDL biomarkers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32489,32489,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
"Business, Liquidity, and Information Cycles",Gorkem Bostanci & Guillermo Ordoñez,"Stock markets play a dual role: help allocate capital by conveying information about firms’ fundamentals and provide liquidity by quickly turning stocks into cash. We propose a trading model in which these two roles are endogenously related: more intensive use of stocks for liquidity affects both the information and the noise about fundamentals contained in prices. We structurally estimate stock price informativeness for several countries and show that it sharply declines when the banking system has trouble providing liquidity. We incorporate this module into a dynamic general equilibrium model to study the real effects of this mechanism through capital misallocation across heterogeneous firms. Calibrating the model for the US, we show that, due to less informative stock markets, the output loss is 43% larger if recessions are accompanied by liquidity distress.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32501,32501,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
The Political Economy of Industrial Policy,Réka Juhász & Nathan J. Lane,"We examine the ways in which political realities shape industrial policy through the lens of modern political economy. We consider two broad “governance constraints”: i) the political forces that shape how industrial policy is chosen and ii) the ways in which state capacity affects implementation. The framework of modern political economy suggests that government failure is not a necessary feature of industrial policy; rather, it is more likely to emerge when countries pursue industrial policies beyond their governance capacity constraints. As such, our political economy of industrial policy is not fatalist. Instead, it enables policymakers to constructively confront challenges.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32507,32507,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
Household Inflation Expectations: An Overview of Recent Insights for Monetary Policy,"Francesco D’Acunto, Evangelos Charalambakis, Dimitris Georgarakos, Geoff Kenny, Justus Meyer & Michael Weber","This paper discusses the recent wave of research that has emphasized the importance of measures of consumers’ inflation expectations. In contrast to other measures of expected inflation, such as for experts or financial market participants, consumers’ inflation expectations capture the broader distribution of societal beliefs about inflation. This research has revealed very significant deviations from traditional assumptions about rationality in consumers’ expectations formation. However, households do act on their beliefs about inflation, though in heterogeneous ways that can depart from the predictions of conventional economic models. Recent euro area experiences highlight the importance of tracking the degree of anchoring in consumers’ inflation expectations in a way that considers their inherent complexity, heterogeneity, and subjectivity. On average, consumers’ medium and longer-term expectations deviate noticeably in levels from central bank targets and, in contrast with expert expectations, often co-move more closely with shorter-term inflation news. By stepping up their engagement with the wider public, central banks may be able to influence expectations by building up greater knowledge and trust and thereby support more effective monetary transmission. Communication efforts need to be persistent because central banks must compete with many other demands on consumers’ attention.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32488,32488,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024

We show that: (1) individuals judged to be of a lower rank are perceived as more likely to be sidelined from beneficial opportunities in many aspects of life; and (2) in response, individuals distort their appearance and consumption choices in order to appear of higher rank. These effects are strong and economically significant. As predicted by a simple signaling model, the distortion is larger for individuals with low (but not too low) socio-economic status.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32491,32491,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
Designing a macroprudential capital buffer for climate-related risks,"Florian Bartsch, Iulia Busies, Tina Emambakhsh, Michael Grill, Mathieu Simoens, Martina Spaggiari, Fabio Tamburrini","Amid the growing financial vulnerabilities posed by climate change, we investigate macroprudential capital buffers to mitigate systemic risks and increase the resilience of the banking sector. Leveraging granular data and state-of-the-art stress testing methods, we quantify potential bank losses attributed to climate-related transition risks. Focusing on short-term transition scenarios, we document a significant variance among banks in their risk exposure, with the most exposed institutions being those characterized by lower excess capital. Subsequently, we introduce a methodological framework for tailoring bank-specific buffer requirements to cover these losses, offering macroprudential authorities a practical method for calibrating climate-related macroprudential capital buffers, complementing microprudential policies. While we focus our application on transition risks, the framework can be extended to capture all climate risks in general. The study demonstrates the potential of macroprudential capital buffers to mitigate potential climate-related losses and contributes to the understanding of the appropriate prudential policy response to these challenges.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2943~1bf261835d.en.pdf?f17d598bf49fc2c54084ecdea242597d,2943,27-May-24,ECB,5/27/2024
A Quantile Model of Firm Investment,"Heitor Almeida, Murillo Campello, Luciano I. de Castro & Antonio F. Galvao Jr","We develop a dynamic model of firm investment under uncertainty that captures firms’ risk attitude using quantile preferences. The firm maximizes its present value, defined as current profits and investment plus the discounted value of the τ-quantile of its value next period. In our framework, τ ∈ (0, 1) parametrizes the firm’s attitude toward downside risk. The model implies that the firm’s investment policy equates the marginal cost of capital with the τ-quantile of the discounted present value of future marginal profits — investment depends directly on the firm’s risk attitude. We further integrate our model into a “q-theory” of investment. Numerical solutions show how heterogeneity across τ-quantiles impacts the value of the firm and investment decisions. Empirical estimations of the quantile investment model show that the strength of the relation between investment and Tobin’s q increases as downside risk aversion decreases. Estimates of firms’ risk attitude reveal evidence of high levels of downside risk aversion.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32498,32498,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
School Equalization in the Shadow of Jim Crow: Causes and Consequences of Resource Disparity in Mississippi circa 1940,"David Card, Leah Clark, Ciprian Domnisoru & Lowell Taylor","A school finance equalization program established in Mississippi in 1920 failed to help many of the state's Black students – an outcome that was typical in the segregated U.S. South (Horace Mann Bond, 1934). In majority-Black school districts, local decision-makers overwhelmingly favored white schools when allotting funds from the state's preexisting per capita fund, and the resulting high expenditures on white students rendered these districts ineligible for the equalization program. Thus, while Black students residing in majority-white districts benefited from increased spending and standards for Black schools, those in majority-Black districts continued to experience extremely low – and even worsening – school funding. We model the processes that led the so-called equalization policy to create disparities in schooling resources for Black students, and estimate effects on Black children using both a neighboring-counties design and an IV strategy. We find that local educational spending had large impacts on Black enrollment rates, as reported in the 1940 census, with Black educational attainment increasing in marginal spending. Finally, we link the 1940 and 2000 censuses to show that Black children exposed to higher levels of school expenditures had significantly more completed schooling and higher income late in life.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32496,32496,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
SAFE to Update Inflation Expectations?

Building on the ECB’s Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE), we introduce consistent measurement of inflation expectations across countries and shed new light on the properties and causal effects of these expectations. We find considerable heterogeneity in firms’ inflation expectations and show that firms disagree about future inflation more than professional forecasters but less than households. We document that differences in firms’ demographics, firms’ choices and constraints, and cross-country macroeconomic environments account for most of the variation in inflation expectations by roughly equal shares. Using an RCT approach, we show that firms update their inflation expectations in a Bayesian manner. Moreover, they revise their plans regarding prices, wages, costs and employment in response to information treatments about current or future inflation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32504,32504,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
Does Occupational Licensing Reduce Job Loss During Recessions?,Peter Q. Blair & Bobby W.

Further Evidence on the Global Decline in the Mental Health of the Young,"David G. Blanchflower, Alex Bryson, Anthony Lepinteur & Alan Piper","Prior to around 2011, there was a pronounced curvilinear relationship between age and wellbeing: poor mental health was hump-shaped with respect to age, whilst subjective well-being was U-shaped.  We examine data from a European panel for France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden called, Come-Here, for 2020-2023, plus data from International Social Survey Program (ISSP) surveys for 2011 and 2021 and some country-specific data. Mental ill-health now declines in a roughly monotonic fashion with age, whilst subjective well-being rises with age.  We also show that young people with poorer mental health spend more time daily in front of a screen on the internet or their smartphone, and that within-person increases in poor mental health are correlated with spending more time in front of a screen.  This evidence appears important because it is among the first pieces of research to use panel data on individuals to track the relationship between screen time and changes in mental health, and because the results caution against simply using the presence of the internet in the household, or low usage indicators (such as having used the internet in the last week) to capture the role played by screen time in the growth of mental ill-health.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32500,32500,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
People's Understanding of Inflation,"Alberto Binetti, Francesco Nuzzi & Stefanie Stantcheva","This paper studies people's understanding of inflation—their perceived causes, consequences, trade-offs—and the policies supported to mitigate its effects. We design a new, detailed online survey based on the rich existing literature in economics with two experimental components—a conjoint experiment and an information experiment—to examine how well public views align with established economic theories. Our key findings show that the major perceived causes of inflation include government actions, such as increased foreign aid and war-related expenditures, alongside rises in production costs attributed to recent events like the COVID-19 pandemic, oil price fluctuations, and supply chain disruptions. Respondents' anticipate many negative consequences of inflation but the most noted one is the increased complexity and difficulty in household decision-making. Partisan differences emerge distinctly, with Republicans more likely to attribute inflation to government policies and foresee broader negative outcomes, whereas Democrats anticipate greater inequality effects. Inflation is perceived as an unambiguously negative phenomenon without any potential positive economic correlates. Notably, there is a widespread belief that managing inflation can be achieved without significant trade-offs, such as reducing economic activity or increasing unemployment. These perceptions are hard to move experimentally. In terms of policy responses, there is resistance to monetary tightening, consistent with the perceived absence of trade-offs and the belief that it is unnecessary to reduce economic activity to fight inflation. The widespread misconception that inflation rises following increases in interest rates even leads to support for rate cuts to reduce inflation. There is a clear preference for policies that are perceived to have other benefits, such as reducing government debt in progressive ways or increasing corporate taxes, and for support for vulnerable households, despite potential inflationary effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32497,32497,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
The Impact of Affirmative Action Litigation on Police Killings of Civilians,"Robynn J.A. Cox, Jamein P. Cunningham & Alberto Ortega","Although research has shown that court-ordered hiring quotas increase the number of minority police officers in litigated cities, there has been little insight into how workforce diversity, or lack thereof, may impact police violence against civilians. Using an event study framework, we find that the threat of affirmative action litigation reduces police killings of non-White civilians in the long-run. In addition, we find evidence of lower arrest rates for non-White civilians and more diverse police departments 25 years after litigation.  Our results highlight the vital role that federal interventions have in addressing police behavior and the use of lethal force.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32502,32502,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
Discount Factors and Monetary Policy: Evidence from Dual-Listed Stocks,"Quentin Vandeweyer, Minghao Yang & Constantine Yannelis","This paper studies the transmission of monetary policy to the stock market through investors’ discount factors. To isolate this channel, we investigate the effect of US monetary policy surprises on the ratio of prices of the same stock listed simultaneously in Hong Kong and Mainland China, and thereby control for revisions in cash-flow expectations. We find this channel to be strong and asymmetric, with the effect driven by surprise monetary policy interest rate cuts. A 100 basis point surprise cut results in a 30 basis point increase in the ratio of stock prices over 5 days. These results suggest significant slow-moving reductions in stock market risk premia following accommodating monetary policy surprises.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32499,32499,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
Economic Budgeting for Endowment-Dependent Universities,"John Y. Campbell, Jeremy C. Stein & Alex A.

Standard budgeting procedures that focus on one or two years at a time and use generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) do not do this. We present an alternative framework that discounts cash flow forecasts over the infinite future and compares the present value of operating obligations to the value of the university’s endowment net of any debt it has issued. We illustrate the potential of this framework using recent data from Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32506,32506,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
Algorithmic Bias and Historical Injustice: Race and Digital Profiling,"Abigail Matthew, Amalia R. Miller & Catherine Tucker","This paper studies the implications of attempts at ""ethnic-affinity"" profiling on Facebook that reflects users' engagement with content on Facebook. Profiling by ethnic-affinity is highly correlated with Census estimates of population race by geography. However, more users were profiled as African-American in former slave states relative to the baseline population. This occurs because the targeting algorithm was better at identifying Black users through differentiated engagement with cultural content in these states. This implies that policies restricting the collection of racial identity data will be unsuccessful due to the existence of proxies, and that relying on proxies may introduce troubling biases.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32485,32485,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
Investment in Infrastructure and Trade: The Case of Ports,"Giulia Brancaccio, Myrto Kalouptsidi & Theodore Papageorgiou","Transportation infrastructure is vital for the smooth functioning of international trade. Ports are a crucial gateway to this system: with more than 80% of trade carried by ships, they shape trade costs, and it is critical that they operate efficiently. Yet ports are susceptible to disruptions, causing costly delays. With enormous budgets spent on infrastructure to alleviate these costs, a key policy question emerges: in a world with high volatility, what are the returns to investing in infrastructure? To address this question, we introduce an empirical framework that combines insights from queueing theory to capture port technology, with tools from demand estimation. We use our framework, together with a collection of novel datasets, to quantify the costs of disruptions and evaluate transportation infrastructure investment. Our analysis unveils three policy-relevant messages: (i) investing in port infrastructure can lead to substantial trade and welfare gains, but only if targeted properly– in fact, net of costs, investment has positive returns at a minority of US ports; (ii) there are sizable spillovers across ports, as investing in one port can decongest a wider set of ports, suggesting that coordinated decision-making may result in more efficient investment decisions; (iii) macroeconomic volatility can drastically change returns to investment and their geography.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32503,32503,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
Returns Heterogeneity and Consumption Inequality Over the Life Cycle,Claudio Daminato & Luigi Pistaferri,"A recent literature argues that persistent heterogeneity in wealth returns (""type dependence"") as well as a positive association with wealth levels (""scale dependence"") play an important role for explaining features of the wealth distribution, especially its extreme concentration at the top. In contrast, traditional models of wealth accumulation emphasize the role of persistent differences in labor earnings. Using panel data from the PSID, we first document that a common unobserved component (which we interpret as the endowment of cognitive and non-cognitive skills of an individual) drives persistent heterogeneity in both wealth returns and labor earnings. We embed these features of the joint wealth return-earnings process in a life-cycle model of consumer behavior and show that ignoring them would dramatically understate average returns for people at the top of the wealth distribution as well as the level and rise of consumption inequality over the life cycle.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32490,32490,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
"Nominal Devaluations, Inflation and Inequality","Andrés Blanco, Andrés Drenik & Emilio Zaratiegui","We study the distribution of labor income during large devaluations. Across countries, inequality falls after large devaluations within the context of a surge in inflation and a fall and subsequent recovery of real labor income. To better understand inequality dynamics, we use a novel administrative dataset covering the 2002 Argentinean devaluation. We show that following a homogeneous fall in real labor income across workers, the bottom of the income distribution recovers faster than the top. Low labor mobility and lack of union coverage among high-income workers explain their slow recovery.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32494,32494,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
The Simple Macroeconomics of AI,Daron Acemoglu,"This paper evaluates claims about large macroeconomic implications of new advances in AI. It starts from a task-based model of AI’s effects, working through automation and task complementarities. So long as AI’s microeconomic effects are driven by cost savings/productivity improvements at the task level, its macroeconomic consequences will be given by a version of Hulten’s theorem: GDP and aggregate productivity gains can be estimated by what fraction of tasks are impacted and average task-level cost savings. Using existing estimates on exposure to AI and productivity improvements at the task level, these macroeconomic effects appear nontrivial but modest—no more than a 0.66% increase in total factor productivity (TFP) over 10 years. The paper then argues that even these estimates could be exaggerated, because early evidence is from easy-to-learn tasks, whereas some of the future effects will come from hard-to-learn tasks, where there are many context-dependent factors affecting decision-making and no objective outcome measures from which to learn successful performance. Consequently, predicted TFP gains over the next 10 years are even more modest and are predicted to be less than 0.53%. I also explore AI’s wage and inequality effects. I show theoretically that even when AI improves the productivity of low-skill workers in certain tasks (without creating new tasks for them), this may increase rather than reduce inequality. Empirically, I find that AI advances are unlikely to increase inequality as much as previous automation technologies because their impact is more equally distributed across demographic groups, but there is also no evidence that AI will reduce labor income inequality. Instead, AI is predicted to widen the gap between capital and labor income. Finally, some of the new tasks created by AI may have negative social value (such as design of algorithms for online manipulation), and I discuss how to incorporate the macroeconomic effects of new tasks that may have negative social value.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32487,32487,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
How Successful Public Health Interventions Fail: Regulating Prostitution in Nineteenth-Century Britain,Grant Goehring & W. Walker Hanlon,"Public health interventions often involve a trade-off between improving health and protecting individual rights. We study this trade-off in a high-stakes setting: prostitution regulations aimed at reducing the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Victorian Britain. These regulations, known as the Contagious Disease Acts (CDAs), introduced a system of registration of sex workers, compulsory medical inspections, and the involuntary confinement of infected workers, in a legal market for sex. The first part of our analysis shows that the CDAs led to substantial public health improvements. However, despite their effectiveness, the CDAs were ultimately repealed. The second part of our study examines the causes of this repeal. We show that repeal was driven by concerns about the violation of the basic rights of sex workers and unequal treatment relative to men who purchased sex. These findings emphasize that the success of a public health intervention depends not only on its effectiveness as a sanitary measure but also on how the costs of the regulation are distributed.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32505,32505,24-May,NBER,5/27/2024
Monetary Policy Strategies to Foster Price Stability and a Strong Labor Market,Michael T. Kiley,"I assess monetary policy strategies to foster price stability and labor market strength. The assessment incorporates a range of challenges, including uncertainty regarding the equilibrium real interest rate, mismeasurement of economic potential, and balancing the costs and benefits associated with employment shortfalls and labor market strength. I find that the ELB remains a significant constraint, hindering achievement of the inflation objective and worsening employment shortfalls. Symmetric policy reaction functions mitigate the most adverse effects of employment shortfalls by contributing to economic stability. Make-up strategies address ELB risks. These strategies call for policy to accommodate some period of inflation above its long-run objective following an ELB episode. I also consider an asymmetric shortfalls approach to policy. This approach provides accommodation in response to weak activity while foregoing tightening in response to strong activity. While the approach can, in principle, address ELB risks by raising inflation, it performs poorly. The shortfalls approach exacerbates economic volatility, worsens employment shortfalls, and creates excess inflationary pressures. Mismeasurement is not sufficient to limit the importance of strong responses to measured slack. Overall, monetary policy can promote price stability and labor market strength by focusing on economic stability, with a strategy targeted to address ELB risks.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/monetary-policy-strategies-to-foster-price-stability-and-a-strong-labor-market.htm,2024-033,24-May,FED-BOARD,5/29/2024
"Monetary Policy, Employment Shortfalls, and the Natural Rate Hypothesis",Michael T. Kiley,"Activity shortfalls are more costly than strong activity. I consider optimal monetary policy under discretion with an asymmetric (activity shortfalls) loss function. The model satisfies the natural rate hypothesis. The asymmetric loss function and resulting optimal monetary policy exacerbates shortfalls in activity. The additional frequency of activity shortfalls arises from the adjustment of expectations implied by the natural rate hypothesis. The shortfalls asymmetry leads to an inflationary bias, similar to results in the time-consistency literature. Mandating a central bank objective with greater symmetry than the social loss function improves outcomes. Greater symmetry lowers the magnitude of activity shortfalls. Greater symmetry also reduces inflation bias. The model also implies that an optimal monetary policy does not accommodate fluctuations from aggregate demand shocks, as is standard in such models. As a result, the analysis implies that monetary accommodation of strength in economic activity likely requires justifications other than asymmetric costs of shortfalls.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/monetary-policy-employment-shortfalls-and-the-natural-rate-hypothesis.htm,2024-032,24-May,FED-BOARD,5/29/2024
Are Supply Networks Efficiently Resilient?,"Agostino Capponi, Chuan Du, Joseph E. Stiglitz","We show that supply networks are inefficiently, and insufficiently, resilient. Upstream firms can expand their production capacity to hedge against supply and demand shocks. The social benefits of such investments are not internalized, however, because of market power and market incompleteness. Upstream firms underinvest in capacity and resilience, passing on the costs to downstream firms, and drive trade excessively toward the spot markets. There is a wedge between the market solution and a constrained optimal benchmark, which persists even without rare and large shocks. Policies designed to incentivize capacity investment, reduce reliance on spot markets, and enhance competition ameliorate the externality.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/are-supply-networks-efficiently-resilient.htm,2024-031,24-May,FED-BOARD,5/29/2024
Geopolitical Oil Price Risk and Economic Fluctuations,"Lutz Kilian, Michael D. Plante and Alexander W.

Answering this question requires simultaneously modeling several features including macroeconomic disasters and geopolitically driven oil production disasters, oil storage and precautionary savings, and the endogenous determination of uncertainty about output and the price of oil. We find that oil price uncertainty tends to be driven by macroeconomic uncertainty. Shifts in the probability of a geopolitically driven major oil supply disruption have meaningful effects on the price of oil and the macro economy, but the resulting oil price uncertainty is not a major driver of fluctuations in macroeconomic aggregates.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2403.pdf,2403,21-May-24,FED-DALLAS,5/29/2024
On the Transition to Modern Growth: Lessons from Recent Agricultural Employment,B. Ravikumar and Guillaume Vandenbroucke,"We study a model where a single good can be produced using a diminishing-returns technology (Malthus) and a constant-returns technology (Solow). We map the Malthus technology to agriculture and show that the share of agricultural employment declines at a constant rate. Using a few recent observations on the share, we estimate the onset of transition for the U.S. and Western Europe without using output data. We show that output growth is higher after the estimated onset of transition than it is before. Our model implies that output growth during the transition is a first-order autoregressive process and that the rate of decline in the share of agricultural employment is a sufficient statistic for the autoregressive coefficient. Quantitatively, while there is no a priori reason that recent agricultural employment would pin down output dynamics over two centuries, the autoregressive coefficient is practically the same as the one implied by the decline in agricultural employment. This quantitative result holds for developing economies as well.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-026,2023-026C,23-Oct,FED-STLOUIS,5/30/2024
Weathering the Storm: Supply Chains and Climate Risk (Revised May 2024),"Juanma Castro-Vincenzi,  Gaurav Khanna,  Nicolas Morales and  Nitya Pandalai-Nayar","We characterize how firms structure supply chains under climate risk. Using new data on the universe of firm-to-firm transactions from an Indian state, we show that firms diversify sourcing locations, and that suppliers exposed to climate risk charge lower prices. Our event-study analysis shows firms with suppliers in flood-affected districts experience a temporary decline in inputs, followed by a return to original levels. We develop a general equilibrium spatial model of firm input sourcing under climate risk. Firms diversify identical inputs from suppliers across space, trading off the probability of a climate disruption against higher input costs. We quantify the model using data on 271 Indian regions, showing real wages vary across space and are correlated with geography and productivity. Wages are inversely correlated with sourcing risk, giving rise to a cost minimization-resilience tradeoff. Supply chain diversification unambiguously reduces real wage volatility, but ambiguously affects their levels, as diversification may come with higher input costs. While diversification helps mitigate climate risk, it exacerbates the distributional effects of climate change by reducing wages in regions prone to more frequent shocks.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2024/wp_24-03,24-03R,24-Apr,FED-RICHMOND,5/31/2024
Central Banking Post Crises,Michael T. Kiley and Frederic S. Mishkin,"The world economy has experienced the largest financial crisis in generations, a global pandemic, and a resurgence in inflation during the first quarter of the 21st century, yielding important insights for central banking. Price stability has important benefits and is the responsibility of a central bank. Achieving price stability in a complex and uncertain environment involves a credible commitment to a nominal anchor with a strong response to inflation and pre-emptive leaning against an overheating economy. Associated challenges imply that central bank communication and transparency are key elements of monetary policy strategies and tactics. Crises have emphasized the role of central banks in promoting financial stability, as financial stability is key to achieving price and economic stability, but this role increases risks to independence. Goals for central banks other than price and economic stability, complemented by financial stability, can make it more difficult for them to stabilize both inflation and economic activity.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/central-banking-post-crises.htm,2024-035,24-May,FED-BOARD,5/31/2024

Capital-Skill Complementarity in Manufacturing: Lessons from the US Shale Boom,Victor Hernandez Martinez,"This paper tests the existence of capital-skill complementarity in the manufacturing sector using quasi-experimental increases in the relative price of low-skill labor induced by the US shale boom. I find that in response to the shale boom, local manufacturing firms decreased their relative usage of low-skill labor while increasing their capital expenditures. These endogenous changes in the input mix allowed manufacturers to maintain the value added despite the increase in the price of low-skill labor, avoiding the potential short-term crowding-out effects of the natural resource boom. Combined with the findings of previous work, my results indicate that the degree of skill substitutable with capital in manufacturing has increased over the last several decades.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2412-capital-skill-complementarity-in-manufacturing,24-12,05.30.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,5/31/2024
Household Inflation Expectations: An Overview of Recent Insights for Monetary Policy,"Francesco D’Acunto, Evangelos Charalambakis, Dimitris Georgarakos, Geoff Kenny, Justus Meyer, Michael Weber","This paper discusses the recent wave of research that has emphasized the importance of measures of consumers’ inflation expectations. In contrast to other measures of expected inflation, such as for experts or financial market participants, consumers’ inflation expectations capture the broader distribution of societal beliefs about inflation. This research has revealed very significant deviations from traditional assumptions about rationality in consumers’ expectations formation. However, households do act on their beliefs about inflation, though in heterogeneous ways that can depart from the predictions of conventional economic models. Recent euro area experiences highlight the importance of tracking the degree of anchoring in consumers’ inflation expectations in a way that considers their inherent complexity, heterogeneity, and subjectivity. On average, consumers’ medium and longer-term expectations deviate noticeably in levels from central bank targets and, in contrast with expert expectations, often co-move more closely with shorter-term inflation news. By stepping up their engagement with the wider public, central banks may be able to influence expectations by building up greater knowledge and trust and thereby support more effective monetary transmission. Communication efforts need to be persistent because central banks must compete with many other demands on consumers’ attention.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/household-inflation-expectations-an-overview-of-recent-insights-for-monetary-policy/,2024-66,30-May-24,BFI,5/31/2024

Understanding the Inequality and Welfare Impacts of Carbon Tax Policies,"Stephie Fried, Kevin Novan, William B.

Do Renewables Shield Inflation from Fossil Fuel-Price Fluctuations?,Laurent Millischer ; Chenxu Fu ; Ulrich Volz ; John Beirne,"This study investigates the relationship between the adoption of renewable energy and the sensitivity of inflation to changes in fossil energy prices across 69 countries over a 50-year period from 1973 to 2022. In the wake of recently increased oil and gas prices leading to a surge in inflation, the notion of a “divine coincidence” suggests that higher levels of renewable energy adoption, in addition to fighting climate change, could mitigate fossil fuel price-induced inflation volatility. Confirming the divine coincidence hypothesis could be an argument in favor of greening monetary policy. However, our empirical results are inconsistent with the hypothesis as we find no evidence that increased renewable energy adoption reduces the impact of fossil fuel price changes on energy inflation rates. This counter-intuitive result may be attributed to idiosyncratic national energy policies, potential threshold effects, or trade linkage spillovers.

Using the augmented factor model approach, we show that the dynamics of the informal economy is shaped by the strength of overall economic activity as well as the interplay between the formal and informal economies.

Weathering Tomorrow: Climate Analogues and Adaptation Gaps in Europe,Armand P Fouejieu ; Shakill Hassan ; Ruben V Atoyan ; Yiran Zha,"The European continent is warming at more than twice the global average. The human and economic costs of higher temperature and more frequent and extreme natural disasters—already substantial in Europe—are expected to increase further unless suitable adaptation strategies are implemented. This paper shows that while Europe's overall vulnerability to climate risks is lower than other regions’, the countries in Central and Eastern Europe face greater human and economic costs from climate disasters compared to their advanced European peers, which are likely to further increase in the future. We use an ensemble of climate models to project future climates for each country in Europe, and identify the country whose present climate best approximates this projection. We rely on this information on countries’ representative future exposure to climate risks to calibrate country-level macro analyses of natural disasters, and how investment in adaptative infrastructure can help mitigate these shocks. We find that adaptation infrastructure can significantly reduce output losses from natural disasters, mitigate medium-term economic scarring, and support sustainable long-term growth.

Nesson","We use data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco Use and Health (PATH), a longitudinal data set including self-reported and biomarker measures of tobacco use, to examine the effects of state-level tobacco 21 (T21) laws on smoking and vaping. T21 laws reduce self-reported cigarette smoking among 18-to-20 year olds, concentrated in males. Initial non-users who “age-out” of treatment are less likely to subsequently initiate self-reported smoking or vaping. Treated smokers are less likely to buy their own cigarettes and more likely to buy cigarettes in a different state. Biomarker results are mixed, and we find some evidence of a reduction in nicotine exposure but less evidence for a reduction in exposure to tobacco. Finally, we test for non-classical measurement error. T21 laws reduce the probability that clinically identified likely cigarette smokers self-report as smokers, which may increase the apparent effect of T21 laws on cigarette smoking as measured by self-reports.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32520,32520,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Is the Decline in the Number of Community Banks Detrimental to Community Economic Development?,"Bernadette Minton, Alvaro G. Taboada & Rohan Williamson","Our research examines the impact of dwindling community bank numbers on community investment and economic development. Initially, we confirm the vital role of community banks’ small business lending in local development. Contrary to popular belief, we find that a decrease in community banks positively affects community investment, through small business loan (SBL) originations. Key factors include the local presence of other community banks and the continuity of the consolidating bank's presence. Interestingly, the effect remains neutral in underserved or distressed counties and diminishes when a large bank acquires a community bank without maintaining a local presence. Post-consolidation, community banks emerge larger and more robust, capable of issuing larger SBLs, while larger banks and Fintech firms contribute by providing smaller SBLs. Overall, our findings reinforce the critical contribution of community banks to local development, suggesting that a reduction in their numbers leads to a stronger, more stable banking infrastructure in the small business lending landscape.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32521,32521,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
The Law of Small Numbers in Financial Markets: Theory and Evidence,Lawrence J. Jin & Cameron Peng,"We build a model of the law of small numbers (LSN)—the incorrect belief that even small samples represent the properties of the underlying population—to study its implications for trading behavior and asset prices. In our model, a belief in the LSN induces investors to expect short-term price trends to revert and long-term price trends to persist. As a result, asset prices exhibit short-term momentum and long-term reversals. The model can reconcile the coexistence of the disposition effect and return extrapolation. In addition, it makes new predictions about investor behavior, including return patterns before purchases and sales, a weakened disposition effect for long-term holdings, doubling down in buying, a positive correlation between doubling down and the disposition effect, and heterogeneous selling propensities to past returns. By testing these predictions using account-level transaction data, we show that the LSN provides a parsimonious way of understanding a variety of puzzles about investor behavior.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32519,32519,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Can Technology Facilitate Scale? Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation of High Dosage Tutoring,"Monica P. Bhatt, Jonathan Guryan, Salman A. Khan, Michael LaForest-Tucker & Bhavya Mishra","High-dosage tutoring is an effective way to improve student learning (Nickow et al., 2024; Guryan et al., 2023). Finding ways to deliver high-dosage tutoring at large scale remains a challenge. Two primary challenges to scaling are cost and staffing. One possible solution is to reduce costs by substituting some tutor time with computer-assisted learning (CAL) technology. The question is: Does doing so compromise effectiveness? This paper provides evidence from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of over 4,000 students in two large school districts in 2018- 19 and 2019-20. The RCT tested the effectiveness of an in-school math tutoring program where students worked in groups of four, with two students working with an in-person tutor while the other two worked on CAL, alternating every other day. The tutoring model had per-pupil costs approximately 30 percent lower than the 2- to-1 tutoring model studied in Guryan et al. (2023). We find gains in students’ math standardized test scores of 0.23 standard deviations for participating students, which are almost as large as the effect sizes of the 2-to-1 tutoring model reported in Guryan et al. (2023). These findings suggest strategic use of technology may be a way to increase the scalability of HDT.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32510,32510,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
A Shared Interest: Do Bonds Strengthen Equity Monitoring?,Todd A. Gormley & Manish Jha,"Institutional investors conduct more governance research and are less likely to follow proxy advisor vote recommendations when a company’s bonds comprise a larger share of their assets. These findings are driven by bond holdings, shareholder proposals, and companies where fixed-income managers are more likely to be attentive and share an interest with equity investors in improving governance. The findings do not concentrate on companies or shareholder proposals where creditor-shareholder conflicts are likely. Overall, the findings suggest that corporate bond holdings influence how actively institutions monitor their equity positions and contribute to institutions’ overall incentive to be engaged stewards.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32530,32530,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Measuring and Predicting “New Work” in the United States: The Role of Local Factors and Global Shocks,"Gueyon Kim, Cassandra Merritt & Giovanni Peri","The evolution of work is of emerging importance to advanced economies' growth. In this study, we develop a new semantic-distance-based algorithm to identify “new work,” namely the new types of jobs introduced in the US. We characterize how “new work” relates to task content of jobs and skill characteristics of workers and document its geographic distribution and association with employment growth.  Then, we analyze whether local factors associated in the previous literature with agglomeration economies and productivity growth as well as local exposures to global shocks—technology, trade, immigration, and population aging—predict the creation of “new work.”  We find local supply of college educated in 1980 as the strongest predictor of “new work.” Using the historical location of 4-year colleges, a strong instrument for local college share, we find a positive and significant causal effect of local supply of human capital on “new work.”",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32526,32526,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Risky Oil: It's All in the Tails,"Christiane Baumeister, Florian Huber & Massimiliano Marcellino","The substantial fluctuations in oil prices in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have highlighted the importance of tail events in the global market for crude oil which call for careful risk assessment. In this paper we focus on forecasting tail risks in the oil market by setting up a general empirical framework that allows for flexible predictive distributions of oil prices that can depart from normality. This model, based on Bayesian additive regression trees, remains agnostic on the functional form of the conditional mean relations and assumes that the shocks are driven by a stochastic volatility model. We show that our nonparametric approach improves in terms of tail forecasts upon three competing models: quantile regressions commonly used for studying tail events, the Bayesian VAR with stochastic volatility, and the simple random walk. We illustrate the practical relevance of our new approach by tracking the evolution of predictive densities during three recent economic and geopolitical crisis episodes, by developing consumer and producer distress indices that signal the build-up of upside and downside price risk, and by conducting a risk scenario analysis for 2024.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32524,32524,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Procyclical Stocks Earn Higher Returns,"William N. Goetzmann, Akiko Watanabe & Masahiro Watanabe","We find that procyclical stocks, whose returns comove with business cycles, earn higher average returns than countercyclical stocks. We use almost a three-quarter century of real GDP growth expectations from economists’ surveys to determine forecasted economic states. This approach largely avoids the confounding effects of econometric forecasting model error. The loading on the expected real GDP growth rate is a priced risk measure. A fully tradable, ex-ante portfolio formed on this loading generates a procyclicality premium that is statistically significant, economically large, long-lasting over a few years, and independent of the size, book-to-market, and momentum effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32509,32509,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
How Far Can Inclusion Go? The Long-term Impacts of Preferential College Admissions,"Michela Carlana, Enrico Miglino & Michela M. Tincani","Affirmative action and preferential admission policies play a crucial role in fostering social mobility by bolstering the prospects of disadvantaged groups. In this paper, we analyze the long-term effects of a Chilean policy (PACE) that targets students in underprivileged schools, offering guaranteed admission to selective colleges to those graduating in the top 15 percent of their high school class. Leveraging both the randomized expansion of PACE and the admission discontinuity, our analysis reveals that PACE yields positive labor market effects for the average targeted student, especially women, driven by the selectivity of the attended colleges. However, for marginally eligible students, higher dropout rates and negative labor market outcomes emerge, suggesting PACE may induce a mismatch between their skills and the academic rigor of selective programs. Finally, we find that students in the bottom 85 percent of their schools experience positive effects on labor market outcomes. We identify equilibrium effects on local labor markets as a potential mechanism. The results suggest that there is a limit to how far preferential admissions can go while delivering on their promises.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32525,32525,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Life-cycle Forces make Monetary Policy Transmission Wealth-centric,"Paul Beaudry, Paolo Cavallino & Tim Willems","This paper adds life-cycle features to a New Keynesian model and shows how this places financial wealth at the center of consumption/saving decisions, thereby enriching the determinants of aggregate demand and affecting the transmission of monetary policy. As retirement preoccupations strengthen, the potency of conventional monetary policy declines and depends more on the response of asset prices (supporting central banks closely monitoring the impact of monetary policy on asset prices). Especially “low/high for long” policies are shown to often have only muted effects on economic activity due to offsetting income and substitution effects of interest rates, in a way that can be compounded by Quantitative Easing. We also show why the presence of life-cycle forces can favor a monetary policy strategy which stabilizes asset prices in response to financial shocks. Being explicit about the role of retirement savings in aggregate demand therefore offers new perspectives on several aspects of monetary interventions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32511,32511,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
The Inflation Accelerator,"Andrés Blanco, Corina Boar, Callum J. Jones & Virgiliu Midrigan","We develop a tractable sticky price model in which the fraction of price changes evolves endogenously over time and, consistent with the evidence, increases with inflation. Because we assume that firms sell multiple products and choose how many, but not which, prices to adjust in any given period, our model admits exact aggregation and reduces to a one-equation extension of the Calvo model. This additional equation determines the fraction of price changes. The model features a powerful inflation accelerator—a feedback loop between inflation and the fraction of price changes—which significantly increases the slope of the Phillips curve during periods of high inflation. Applied to the U.S. time series, our model predicts that the slope of the Phillips curve ranges from 0.02 in the 1990s to 0.20 in the 1970s and 1980s.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32531,32531,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
"Trust, Intangible Assets, and Productivity","Gilbert Cette, Jimmy Lopez, Jacques Mairesse & Giuseppe Nicoletti","Business environments dominated by information flows and autonomous tasks, typical of knowledge-intensive industries, are likely to require enough social capital to be viable and productive. In this paper, we use new EUKLEMS-INTANProd industry-level data (Bontadini et al., 2023a) covering a panel of 19 countries and 20 industries over the 1995-2018 period to investigate the influence of a key element of social capital – trust – on labour productivity in intangible-intensive industries, controlling for hiring and firing regulations that can constrain the ability of managers to implement best practices productively. We find that in such industries, productivity gains from high levels of trust are stronger than elsewhere, while too strict hiring and firing regulations are more damaging for productivity. Using a more limited sample for which data on management quality are available, we show that the positive impact of high trust on productivity in intangible-intensive industries is channeled by the ability to benefit from good management, a key element of organizational capital. Productivity gains from relatively high levels of trust in knowledge-rich environments are estimated to be sizeable and our estimates survive a number of robustness checks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32513,32513,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
What is Newsworthy? Theory and Evidence,"Luis Armona, Matthew Gentzkow, Emir Kamenica & Jesse M. Shapiro","We study newsworthiness in theory and practice. We focus on situations in which a news outlet observes the realization of a state of the world and must decide whether to report the realization to a consumer who pays an opportunity cost to consume the report. The consumer-optimal reporting probability is monotone in a proper scoring rule, a statistical measure of the amount of “news” in the realization relative to the consumer’s prior. We show that a particular scoring rule drawn from the statistics literature parsimoniously captures key patterns in reporting probabilities across several domains of US television news. We argue that the scoring rule can serve as a useful control variable in settings where a researcher wishes to test for bias in news reporting. Controlling for the score greatly lessens the appearance of bias in our applications.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32512,32512,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Unemployment Insurance Fraud in the Debit Card Market,"Umang Khetan, Jetson Leder-Luis, Jialan Wang & Yunrong Zhou","We study fraud in the unemployment insurance (UI) system using a dataset of 35 million debit card transactions. We apply machine learning techniques to cluster cards corresponding to varying levels of suspicious or potentially fraudulent activity. We then conduct a difference-in-differences analysis based on the staggered adoption of state-level identity verification systems between 2020 and 2021 to assess the effectiveness of screening for reducing fraud. Our findings suggest that identity verification reduced payouts to suspicious cards by 27%, while non-suspicious cards were largely unaffected by these technologies. Our results indicate that identity screening may be an effective mechanism for mitigating fraud in the UI system and for benefits programs more broadly.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32527,32527,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
The Exchange Rate as an Industrial Policy,"Pablo Ottonello, Diego J. Perez & William Witheridge","We study the role of exchange rates in industrial policy. We construct an open-economy macroeconomic framework with production externalities and show that the desirability of these policies critically depends on the dynamic patterns of externalities. When they are stronger in earlier stages of development, economies that are converging to the technological frontier can improve welfare by intervening in foreign exchange markets, keeping the exchange rate undervalued, and speeding the transition; economies that are not converging to the technological frontier are better off not using the exchange rate as an industrial policy tool. Capital-flow mobility and labor market dynamism play a central role in the effectiveness of these policies. We also discuss the role of capital controls as an industrial policy tool and use our framework to interpret historical experiences.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32522,32522,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Her Property Transactions: White Women and the Frequency of Female Ownership in the Antebellum Era,Benton Wishart & Trevon D. Logan,"The traditional historical narrative claims that White women were rarely involved in market transactions for enslaved people in the antebellum United States.  Using transaction records, notary statements, and runaway advertisements, we provide the first quantitative estimates of the extent of White women’s involvement in antebellum slave transactions as owners of record.  Contrary to the narrative, we find that White women were quite frequently noted as owners of record in transactions as both buyers and sellers.  White women participated in more than 30% of the transactions in the largest market for enslaved people in the antebellum era.  We also find that White women were especially likely to be owners involved in transactions with enslaved women, where they were listed as owners in nearly 40% of transactions.  Linking transaction participants to the census, we find that White women owners were not more likely to be widows nor were they older than women in the general population.  Overall, our results are consistent with the new historical narrative that White women were ubiquitous in enslavement transactions and this was a critical part of White women’s economic activity in the antebellum era.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32529,32529,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Medical Cannabis Availability and Mental Health: Evidence From New York’s Medical Cannabis Program,"Coleman Drake, Dylan Nagy, Matthew D.

We use granular geographic data to estimate medical cannabis dispensary availability’s effects on self-reported mental health in New York state from 2011 through 2021 using a two-stage difference-in-differences approach to minimize bias introduced from the staggered opening of dispensaries. Our findings rule out that medical cannabis availability had negative effects on mental health for the adult population overall. We also find that medical cannabis availability reduced past-month self-reported poor mental health days by nearly 10%—3.37 percentage points—among adults 65 and above. These results suggest medical cannabis access has positive health impacts for older populations, likely through pain relief.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32514,32514,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Latent Heterogeneity in the Marginal Propensity to Consume,"Daniel Lewis, Davide Melcangi & Laura Pilossoph","We estimate the unconditional distribution of the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) using clustering regression applied to the 2008 economic stimulus payments. By deviating from the standard approach of estimating MPC heterogeneity using interactions with observables, we can recover the full distribution of MPCs. We find households spent between 4 and 133% of the rebate within a quarter, and individual households used rebates for different goods. While many observable characteristics correlate individually with our estimated MPCs, these relationships disappear when tested jointly, except for income and the average propensity to consume. Household observable characteristics explain only 8% of MPC variation, highlighting the role of latent heterogeneity.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32523,32523,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
"Broadband Internet Access, Economic Growth, and Wellbeing",Kathryn R. Johnson & Claudia Persico,"Between 2000 and 2008, access to high-speed, broadband internet grew significantly in the United States, but there is debate on whether access to high-speed internet improves or harms wellbeing. We find that a ten percent increase in the proportion of county residents with access to broadband internet leads to a 1.01 percent reduction in the number of suicides in a county, as well as improvements in self-reported mental and physical health. We further find that this reduction in suicide deaths is likely due to economic improvements in counties that have access to broadband internet. Counties with increased access to broadband internet see reductions in poverty rate and unemployment rate. In addition, zip codes that gain access to broadband internet see increases in the numbers of employees and establishments. In addition, heterogeneity analysis indicates that the positive effects are concentrated in the working age population, those between 25 and 64 years old. This pattern is precisely what is predicted by the literature linking economic conditions to suicide risk.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32517,32517,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024

The model is calibrated to match firm-level productivity and demand processes estimated from U.S. data. Despite its simplicity, the calibrated model delivers untargeted pricing dynamics and a markup distribution that are consistent with U.S. micro data. Moreover, it also generates sizable monetary non-neutrality that rivals more complicated alternative menu cost models that explicitly target pricing dynamics. The key in reconciling firm and pricing dynamics comes from the interaction between non-constant elasticity of demand and idiosyncratic demand shocks. Thus, this framework  effortlessly unifies pricing, markup, and firm dynamics.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32518,32518,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
An Analysis of Pandemic-Era Inflation in 11 Economies,Olivier J. Blanchard & Ben S. Bernanke,"In a collaborative project with ten central banks, we have investigated the causes of the post-pandemic global inflation, building on our earlier work for the United States. Globally, as in the United States, pandemic-era inflation was due primarily to supply disruptions and sharp increases in the prices of food and energy; however, and in sharp contrast to the 1970s, the inflationary effects of these supply shocks have not been persistent, in part due to the credibility of central bank inflation targets. As the effects of supply shocks have subsided, tight labor markets, and the rises in nominal wages, have become relatively more important sources of inflation in many countries. In several countries, including the United States, curbing wage inflation and returning price inflation to target may require a period of modestly higher unemployment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32532,32532,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Understanding Expert Choices Using Decision Time,"David Card, Stefano DellaVigna, Chenxi Jiang & Dmitry Taubinsky","Laboratory experiments find a robust relationship between decision times and perceived values of alternatives. This paper investigates how these findings translate to experts' decision making and information acquisition in the field. In a stylized model of expert choice between two alternatives, we show that (i) less-commonly chosen alternatives are more likely to be chosen later than earlier; (ii) decision time is higher when the likelihood of choosing each alternative is closer to fifty percent; and (iii) the ultimate quality of the chosen alternative may increase or decrease with decision time, depending on whether earlier or later signals are more informative. We test these predictions in the editorial setting, where we observe proxies for paper quality and signals available to editors. We document that (i) the probability of a positive decision rises with decision time; (ii) average decision time is higher when our estimated probability of a positive decision is closer to fifty percent; and (iii) paper quality is positively (negatively) related to decision time for papers with Reject (R&R) decisions. Structural estimates show that the additional information acquired in editorial delays is modest, and has little impact on the quality of decisions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32515,32515,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
Gender-Specific Transportation Costs and Female Time Use: Evidence from India’s Pink Slip Program,"Yutong Chen, Kerem Coşar, Devaki Ghose, Shirish Mahendru & Sheetal Sekhri","Reducing gender-specific commuting barriers in developing countries has complex and diverse effects on women’s labor dynamics. We study a program that offers free bus rides for women in several Indian states (the Pink Slip program) using a synthetic difference-in-differences approach to shed light on labor supply and time use decisions of women. We observe decreased bus expenses and time saved on travel. Skilled employed women increase labor supply, while low-skill married women shift focus to household chores. Unemployed women intensify job searches, yet overall employment rates remain unchanged. Our findings highlight that alleviating commuting costs does not uniformly boost women’s labor participation, as gender roles and societal norms continue to shape outcomes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32508,32508,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024
The Concave Phillips Curve,Narayana R. Kocherlakota,"This paper derives the curvature properties of the short-run Phillips curve in a class of canonical models of price-setting frictions. Contrary to conventional thinking, the Phillips curve is asymptotically horizontal for high levels of economic activity and asymptotically vertical for low levels of economic activity. Moreover, it is globally concave for a wide class of models, including many in which average real marginal cost is an unbounded convex function of economic activity. Intuitively, when economic activity is very high (low), substitution effects within the model-implied true price index imply that inflation behaves as if prices are nearly fully sticky (flexible). Using (conventional) measures of inflation that understate the relevant substitution effects may lead to misleading conclusions about the curvature of the Phillips curve, and to corresponding errors in the formulation of monetary policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32528,32528,24-Jun,NBER,6/3/2024

Reinforcement Learning from Experience Feedback: Application to Economic Policy,Tohid Atashbar,"Learning from the past is critical for shaping the future, especially when it comes to economic policymaking. Building upon the current methods in the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the large language models (LLMs), this paper introduces Reinforcement Learning from Experience Feedback (RLXF), a procedure that tunes LLMs based on lessons from past experiences. RLXF integrates historical experiences into LLM training in two key ways - by training reward models on historical data, and by using that knowledge to fine-tune the LLMs. As a case study, we applied RLXF to tune an LLM using the IMF's MONA database to generate historically-grounded policy suggestions. The results demonstrate RLXF's potential to equip generative AI with a nuanced perspective informed by previous experiences. Overall, it seems RLXF could enable more informed applications of LLMs for economic policy, but this approach is not without the potential risks and limitations of relying heavily on historical data, as it may perpetuate biases and outdated assumptions.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/07/Reinforcement-Learning-from-Experience-Feedback-Application-to-Economic-Policy-549977,2024-114,"Fri, 07 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/8/2024

Policy Multipliers in Japan Under QQE,Sam Ouliaris ; Celine Rochon,"This paper tests whether Japan's key macro policy multipliers have declined since 2013, the year that Japan introduced Qualitative and Quantitative Easing. We use the augmented Blanchard-Perotti structural VAR model introduced in Ouliaris and Rochon (2021) to study the dynamic effects of shocks in the central bank’s asset holdings, interest rates, and debt levels relative to GDP on economic activity in Japan. We find that both the expenditure and tax multipliers of Japan have fallen, implying that the effectiveness of fiscal policy in Japan declined following the change in monetary policy. Moreover, we find that the efficacy of quantitative easing is small, implying the need for huge interventions to have a significant effect on real GDP, and that the effectiveness of quantitative easing has declined since 2013. We argue that the reduction in policy multipliers can be attributed to the upward trend in the government debt level relative to GDP which, despite historically low interest rates, has increased Japan’s structural deficit, and the likelihood of reduced expenditures and higher taxes going forward.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/07/Policy-Multipliers-in-Japan-Under-QQE-549954,2024-113,"Fri, 07 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/8/2024
Monitoring Privately-held Firms' Default Risk in Real Time: A Signal-Knowledge Transfer Learning Model,Jorge A Chan-Lau ; Ruofei Hu ; Luca Mungo ; Ritong Qu ; Weining Xin ; Cheng Zhong,"We develop a mixed-frequency, tree-based, gradient-boosting model designed to assess the default risk of privately held firms in real time. The model uses data from publicly-traded companies to construct a probability of default (PD) function. This function integrates high-frequency, market-based, aggregate distress signals with low-frequency, firm-level financial ratios, and macroeconomic indicators. When provided with private firms' financial ratios, the model, which we name signal-knowledge transfer learning model (SKTL), transfers insights gained from 35 thousand publicly-traded firms to more than 4 million private-held ones and performs well as an ordinal measure of privately-held firms' default risk.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/07/Monitoring-Privately-held-Firms-Default-Risk-in-Real-Time-A-Signal-Knowledge-Transfer-549982,2024-115,"Fri, 07 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/8/2024
Exposure to Artificial Intelligence and Occupational Mobility: A Cross-Country Analysis,Mauro Cazzaniga ; Carlo Pizzinelli ; Emma J Rockall ; Marina Mendes Tavares,"We document historical patterns of workers' transitions across occupations and over the life-cycle for different levels of exposure and complementarity to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Brazil and the UK. In both countries, college-educated workers frequently move from high-exposure, low-complementarity occupations (those more likely to be negatively affected by AI) to high-exposure, high-complementarity ones (those more likely to be positively affected by AI). This transition is especially common for young college-educated workers and is associated with an increase in average salaries. Young highly educated workers thus represent the demographic group for which AI-driven structural change could most expand opportunities for career progression but also highly disrupt entry into the labor market by removing stepping-stone jobs. These patterns of “upward” labor market transitions for college-educated workers look broadly alike in the UK and Brazil, suggesting that the impact of AI adoption on the highly educated labor force could be similar across advanced economies and emerging markets. Meanwhile, non-college workers in Brazil face markedly higher chances of moving from better-paid high-exposure and low-complementarity occupations to low-exposure ones, suggesting a higher risk of income loss if AI were to reduce labor demand for the former type of jobs.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/07/Exposure-to-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Occupational-Mobility-A-Cross-Country-Analysis-549989,2024-116,"Fri, 07 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/8/2024
The Effect of E-Cigarette Flavor Bans on Tobacco Use,"Chad D. Cotti, Charles J. Courtemanche, Yang Liang, Johanna Catherine Maclean, Erik T. Nesson & Joseph J. Sabia","Advocates for sales restrictions on flavored e-cigarettes argue that flavors appeal to young people and lead them down a path to nicotine addiction. This study is among the first to examine the effect of state and local restrictions on the sale of flavored electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products on youth and young adult tobacco use. Using data from the State and National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys, we find that the adoption of an ENDS flavor restriction reduces frequent and everyday youth ENDS use by 1.2 to 2.5 percentage points. Auxiliary analyses of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System show similar effects on ENDS use for young adults ages 18-20. However, we also detect evidence of an unintended effect of ENDS flavor restrictions that is especially clear among 18-20-year-olds: inducing substitution to combustible cigarette smoking. Finally, there is no evidence that ENDS flavor restrictions affect ENDS use among adults aged 21 and older or non-tobacco-related health behaviors such as binge drinking and illicit drug use.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32535,32535,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
Pricing Under Distress,"S. Borağan Aruoba, Andrés Fernández, Daniel Guzmán, Ernesto Pastén & Felipe Saffie","Uncertainty triggers two confounding effects: a realization and an anticipation effect.  By using the 2019 riots in Chile as a quasi-natural experiment, we show that the pricing behavior of supermarkets is consistent with a pure anticipation effect: during the 31-day period following the start of the Riots, supermarkets reduce the frequency of price changes and, conditional on a price change, the absolute magnitude of price changes increase. A quantitative menu cost model with news about a future increase in idiosyncratic demand dispersion can deliver these pricing dynamics.

Using data on bankruptcy efficiency and business credit around the world, we document that business credit booms are followed by severe declines in output, investment, and consumption in environments with poorly functioning business bankruptcy. On the contrary, in settings with well functioning business bankruptcy, the aftermath of credit booms is characterized by moderate changes in economic activities.

On Robust Inference in Time Series Regression,"Richard T. Baillie, Francis X. Diebold, George Kapetanios, Kun Ho Kim & Aaron Mora","Least squares regression with heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors (“OLS-HC regression”) has proved very useful in cross section environments. However, several major difficulties, which are generally overlooked, must be confronted when transferring the HC technology to time series environments via heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard errors (“OLS-HAC regression”). First, in plausible time-series environments, OLS parameter estimates can be inconsistent, so that OLS-HAC inference fails even asymptotically. Second, most economic time series have autocorrelation, which renders OLS parameter estimates inefficient. Third, autocorrelation similarly renders conditional predictions based on OLS parameter estimates inefficient. Finally, the structure of popular HAC covariance matrix estimators is ill-suited for capturing the autoregressive autocorrelation typically present in economic time series, which produces large size distortions and reduced power in HAC-based hypothesis testing, in all but the largest samples. We show that all four problems are largely avoided by the use of a simple and easily-implemented dynamic regression procedure, which we call DURBIN. We demonstrate the advantages of DURBIN with detailed simulations covering a range of practical issues.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32554,32554,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
"Automation and Rent Dissipation: Implications for Wages, Inequality, and Productivity",Daron Acemoglu & Pascual Restrepo,"This paper studies the effects of automation in economies with labor market distortions that generate worker rents—wages above opportunity cost—in some jobs. We show that automation targets high-rent tasks, dissipating rents and amplifying wage losses from automation. It also reduces within-group wage dispersion for exposed groups. Automation-driven rent dissipation is inefficient and reduces (and could even negate) the productivity gains from automation. Using data for the US from 1980 to 2016, we find evidence of sizable rent dissipation and reduced within-group wage dispersion due to automation. Using these estimates and accounting for equilibrium effects, we estimate that automation accounts for 52% of the increase in between-group inequality in the US since 1980, with rent dissipation being responsible for a fifth of this contribution. We also estimate that inefficient rent dissipation offset 60–90% of the productivity gains from automation since 1980.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32536,32536,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
What Can Measured Beliefs Tell Us About Monetary Non-Neutrality?,"Hassan Afrouzi, Joel P.

In a general equilibrium model with both nominal rigidities and endogenous information acquisition, we analytically characterize firms’ optimal dynamic information policies and how their beliefs affect monetary non-neutrality. We then show that data on the cross-sectional distributions of uncertainty and pricing durations are both necessary and sufficient to identify monetary non-neutrality. Finally, implementing our approach in New Zealand survey data, we find that informational frictions approximately double monetary non-neutrality and endogeneity of information is important: models with exogenous information would overstate monetary non-neutrality by approximately 50%.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32541,32541,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
Food Policy in a Warming World,"Allan Hsiao, Jacob Moscona & Karthik Sastry","Do governments systematically intervene in agricultural markets in response to climate shocks? If so, what are the aggregate and distributional consequences? We construct a global dataset of agricultural policies and extreme heat exposure by country and crop since 1980. We find that extreme heat shocks to domestic production lead to increased consumer assistance. This effect is persistent, primarily implemented via border policies, and stronger in election years when politicians are particularly responsive to constituent demands. Shocks to foreign production lead to increased producer assistance, consistent with policymakers' targeting redistribution rather than price stabilization. Interpreted via a model, the estimates imply that policy responses almost fully stabilize prices in shocked markets, reducing losses to domestic consumers by 97% while increasing those to domestic producers and foreign consumers by 55% and 105%, respectively.  Responsive policy exacerbates overall welfare losses from projected end-of-century climate shocks by 14%.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32539,32539,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
Outages in sovereign bond markets,"Mark Kerssenfischer, Caspar Helmus","We use outages as natural experiments to study sovereign bond market functioning. When the euro area futures market goes down, trading activity on the cash market declines, liquidity evaporates, and transaction prices deviate from fundamental values. Tracing back this macrolevel market breakdown to the micro-level, we show that particularly dealers withdraw from the cash market during outages. While most of their remaining trades remain fairly priced, dealer’s capacity to intermediate trades on the cash market is reduced, forcing more clients to trade directly with each other, leading to substantial mispricing. Lastly, outages on cash trading venues barely affect the futures market, suggesting that price formation and liquidity provision is a one-way street, and outages on the US and euro area futures market barely affect each other, in stark contrast to the significant price spillovers. Our results reveal the trade-offs between a (de)centralized market structure, they support cross-asset learning models to explain the link between liquidity and arbitrage, and they demonstrate how financial intermediaries can impose important limits to arbitrage.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2944~5cc218150b.en.pdf?190f6a113f52b9539118b14353e7bf44,2944,10-Jun-24,ECB,6/10/2024
Tasks and Black-white Inequality over the Long Twentieth Century,"Rowena Gray, Siobhan M. O'Keefe, Sarah Quincy & Zachary Ward","We present new evidence on the long-run trend of occupational task content by race in the United States, 1900-2021. Black workers began the transition to better paid, cognitive-intensive modern jobs at least a generation after white workers; substantial convergence only occurred from 1960 onwards. Longitudinal data suggests that transitions to new task content were racially biased: Black men moved to jobs with lower rewarded task content than white men, conditional on initial task content, though gaps decreased after World War II.   Routine-intensive Black workers were less likely to move up into non-routine analytic work compared to white workers in both historical and modern periods. The results suggest that task-displacement shocks, such as automating routine-manual work, widen Black-white inequality",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32545,32545,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
Employment and Labor Supply Responses to the Child Tax Credit Expansion: Theory and Evidence,Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach & Michael R. Strain,"The 2021 Child Tax Credit (CTC) expansion increased government benefits to families, and especially to families with the lowest incomes. Economic theory predicts that this policy intervention would have led to a reduction in labor supply among adults in those families. Our review of available research suggests that employment within broadly defined demographic groups was not reduced by the 2021 CTC changes. However, we present evidence that employment was reduced among mothers with relatively low levels of education — the demographic group that was most affected by the CTC expansion. For the 2021 CTC expansion, theory and evidence were in the strongest alignment when the research design that produced the evidence was most focused on the demographic groups most likely to be affected by the expansion.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32552,32552,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024

The Rise of the Religious Right: Evidence from the Moral Majority and the Jimmy Carter Presidency,Giulia Buccione & Brian G. Knight,"We investigate the rise of the religious right in the context of the Moral Majority and Jimmy Carter, the first Evangelical President. During Carter's Presidency, the Moral Majority, an Evangelical group headed by televangelist Jerry Falwell, turned against the incumbent Carter, a Democrat, and campaigned for Ronald Reagan, a Republican, in the 1980 Election. To investigate the role of religious groups and leaders in the political persuasion of followers, we first develop a theoretical model in which single-issue religious voters follow better-informed religious leaders when choosing which candidates to support. Using data from county-level voting returns, exit polls, and surveys, we document that Evangelical voters indeed shifted their support from Carter in 1976 to Reagan in 1980. We also provide three pieces of evidence that the Moral Majority played a role in this switching: survey data on Moral Majority campaign issues, exposure to Jerry's Falwell's television ministry, and exposure to state headquarters of the Moral Majority.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32551,32551,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
Comprehensive E-cigarette Flavor Bans and Tobacco Use among Youth and Adults,"Henry Saffer, Selen Ozdogan, Michael Grossman, Daniel L. Dench & Dhaval M. Dave","The vast majority of youth e-cigarette users consume flavored e-cigarettes, raising concerns from public health advocates that flavors may drive youth initiation into and continued use of e-cigarettes. Flavors drew further notice from the public health community following the sudden outbreak of lung injury among vapers in 2019, prompting several states to enact sweeping bans on flavored e-cigarettes. In this study, we examine the effects of these comprehensive bans on e-cigarette use and potential spillovers into other tobacco use by youth, young adults, and adults. We utilize both standard difference-in-differences (DID) and synthetic DID methods, in conjunction with four national data sets. We find evidence that young adults decrease their use of the banned flavored e-cigarettes as well as their overall e-cigarette use, by about two percentage points, while increasing cigarette use. For youth, there is some suggestive evidence of increasing cigarette use, though these results are contaminated by pre-trend differences between treatment and control units. The bans have no effect on e-cigarette and smoking participation among older adults (ages 25+). Our findings suggest that statewide comprehensive flavor bans may have generated an unintended consequence by encouraging substitution towards traditional smoking in some populations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32534,32534,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
Organizing a Kingdom,"Charles Angelucci, Simone Meraglia & Nico Voigtländer","We develop a framework that examines the organizational challenges faced by central rulers governing large territories, where administrative power needs to be delegated to local elites. We describe how economic change can motivate rulers to empower different elites and emphasize the interaction between local and nationwide institutions. We show that rising economic potential of towns leads to local administrative power (self-governance) of urban elites. As a result, the ruler summons them to central assemblies in order to ensure effective communication and coordination between self-governing towns and the rest of the realm. This framework can explain the emergence of municipal autonomy and towns’ representation in early modern European parliaments—a blueprint for Western Europe’s institutional framework that promoted state-formation and economic growth in the centuries to follow. We provide empirical evidence for our core mechanisms and discuss how the model applies to other historical dynamics, and to alternative organizational settings.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32542,32542,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024

Sleep: Educational Impact and Habit Formation,"Osea Giuntella, Silvia Saccardo & Sally Sadoff","There is growing evidence on the importance of sleep for productivity, but little is known about the impact of interventions targeting sleep. In a field experiment among U.S. university students, we show that incentives for sleep increase both sleep and academic performance. Motivated by theories of cue-based habit formation, our primary intervention couples personalized bedtime reminders with morning feedback and immediate rewards for sleeping at least seven hours on weeknights. The intervention increases the share of nights with at least seven hours of sleep by 26 percent and average weeknight sleep by an estimated 19 minutes during a four-week treatment period, with persistent effects of about eight minutes per night during a one to five-week post-treatment period.  Comparisons to secondary treatments show that immediate incentives have larger impacts on sleep than delayed incentives or reminders and feedback alone during the treatment period, but do not have statistically distinguishable impacts on longer-term sleep habits in the post-treatment period. We estimate that immediate incentives improve average semester course performance by 0.075--0.088 grade points, a 0.10--0.11 standard deviation increase. Our results demonstrate that incentives to sleep can be a cost-effective tool for improving educational outcomes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32550,32550,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024

I find that the incumbent could have likely profitably deterred entry. It did not, however, waiting instead to respond only once the entrant began building.

The Social Value of Hurricane Forecasts,Renato Molina & Ivan Rudik,"What is the impact and value of hurricane forecasts? We study this question using newly-collected forecast data for major US hurricanes since 2005. We find higher wind speed forecasts increase pre-landfall protective spending, but erroneous under-forecasts increase post-landfall damage and rebuilding expenditures. Our main contribution is a new theoretically-grounded approach for estimating the marginal value of forecast improvements. We find that the average annual improvement reduced total per-hurricane costs, inclusive of unobserved protective spending, by $700,000 per county. Improvements since 2007 reduced costs by 19%, averaging $5 billion per hurricane.

Attention Cycles,Joel P. Flynn & Karthik Sastry,"We study how bounded rationality coevolves with the business cycle. We introduce a business-cycle model in which firms face a cognitive cost of making precise decisions. Theoretically, we characterize equilibrium with non-parametric, state-dependent stochastic choice. Firms have greater incentives to pay attention in downturns because they are owned by risk-averse households. Correspondingly, the model generates counter-cyclical attention, pro-cyclical mistakes, and an endogenous attention wedge that depresses aggregate productivity when attention is low. Empirically, we test the model's predictions using novel measures of firms' mistakes and attention. Quantitatively, attention cycles generate significant stochastic volatility of output growth and shock propagation asymmetries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32553,32553,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
Place-Based Economic Development and Long-Run Firm Employment and Sales: Evidence from American Indian Reservations,"Joseph A.

Our analysis focuses on the effect of this national (across 29 U.S. states) place-based economic development program over several decades. We create a novel data set linking a firm-level panel dataset of business outcomes and tribal casino operations by geographic location over several decades. We find that after the start of tribal casino operations, there is a substantial average increase in employment and sales for local firms. We also show that casino operations drive initial increases in employment and sales; however, pre-existing firms also realize gains in employment and sales in the subsequent 2-5 years after the start of casino operations. These effects also spill over to firms in non-related industries; in our analysis, we exclude the Arts, Entertainment, Recreation, Accommodation and Food Services industries and we continue to observe higher employment for firms located on tribal reservations with casino operations.

Voluntary Minimum Wages,Ellora Derenoncourt & David Weil,"Recent wage growth at the bottom of the earnings distribution in the U.S. has reversed a decades-long trend of widening wage inequality. Numerous state and local minimum wage increases have overtaken an effectively non-binding federal minimum, and robust labor demand in the post-pandemic recovery drove wage growth in the low-wage sector. An increasingly pervasive phenomenon over this same period (2014-2023) is the use of company-wide, voluntary minimum wages (VMWs) by private employers, including some of the largest U.S. retailers. We use anonymized payroll data for thousands of firms collected by a major credit bureau to study the effects of these policies on large retailers’ own wages and employment, as well as spillover effects onto other employers in shared labor markets, variously defined. Using stacked event studies centered around multiple VMW events and a continuous treatment variable defined as the gap between local area wages and the company minimum, we find that VMWs result in sizable wage increases and reductions in turnover at the companies that implemented them. Turning to wages at other companies, including those connected to the large retailer by worker flows, we estimate precise, economically negligible spillover effects. Despite the decline in separations from companies with voluntary minimums, overall hiring rates at connected employers do not decline, consistent with substitutability across new hires. Although voluntary minimum wage policies have affected over 3 million jobs among the largest retailers, their impact on the broader labor market is limited.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32546,32546,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
The Effects of Short-Term Rental Regulation: Insights from Chicago,"Ginger Zhe Jin, Liad Wagman & Mengyi Zhong","We provide an in-depth study of short-term rental (STR) regulation in Chicago. While many municipalities choose between outright bans or laissez-faire strategies concerning STR activities, Chicago pioneered a middle-ground ordinance, enabling the market to exist with limitations and registrations, and imposing a new tax. We show that compared to three control cities, the number of active Airbnb listings in Chicago declined 16.4% in the two years after the ordinance, but this effect is only significant after the city began receiving detailed data feeds from STR platforms. We further demonstrate (i) localized reductions in burglaries near buildings that prohibit STR listings as part of a new capability of the ordinance, (ii) Airbnb revenues declined more in zip codes with above-median hotel revenues, and (iii) Chicago's middle ground approach generated different and nuanced effects on different STR stakeholders, including the city itself in terms of its STR tax revenues.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32537,32537,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
Do Stronger IPR Incentivize Female Participation in Innovation? Evidence from Chinese AI Patents,"Shubhangi Agrawal, Sawan Rathi, Chirantan Chatterjee & Matthew J. Higgins","Do stronger intellectual property rights incentivize female participation in innovation? We provide new evidence on this question using a unique database of artificial intelligence patents publicly shared by the USPTO. Our identification strategy leverages China’s WTO TRIPs accession, which led to stronger intellectual property rights in 2002. We find a significant rise in the number of female inventors and an increase in the number of patents with females on inventor teams vis-a-vis a control group of countries. We also find that after stronger intellectual property rights, the quality of Chinese artificial intelligence patents with female inventors on the team improved. Results are robust controlling for unobserved heterogeneity at the country, technology class, and over time. Additional robustness tests with synthetic controls, coarsened exact matching, randomized inference and alternative control groups support our benchmark findings.

Synthesis of Evidence Yields High Social Cost of Carbon Due to Structural Model Variation and Uncertainties,"Frances C. Moore, Moritz A. Drupp, James Rising, Simon Dietz, Ivan Rudik & Gernot Wagner","Estimating the cost to society from a ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere requires connecting a model of the climate system with a representation of the economic and social effects of changes in climate, as well as the valuation and aggregation of diverse, uncertain impacts across both time and space. The literature on this cost, termed the social cost of carbon (SCC), is large and growing. Prior work has largely focused on better constraining the values of parameters such as climate sensitivity, the discount rate, and the damage function. A growing literature has also examined the effect of varying more fundamental structural elements of the models supporting SCC calculations. These structural model choices—including the introduction of climate or economic tipping points, changing the structure of economic preferences, and accounting for the persistence of climate damages—have been analyzed in piecemeal, uncoordinated fashion, leaving their relative importance unclear. Here we perform a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the SCC, combining 1823 estimates of the SCC from 147 studies published between 2000 and 2020 with a survey of the authors of these studies. The distribution of published SCC values for a 2020 pulse year is wide and substantially right-skewed, showing evidence of a heavy right tail (truncated mean of $132, median $39). Analysis of variance reveals important roles for structural elements in driving SCC estimates, particularly the inclusion of persistent damages via effects on economic growth, representation of the Earth system, and distributional weighting. However, our survey reveals that experts believe the literature is biased downwards due to an under-sampling of structural model variations, as well as biases in damage-function and discount-rate parameters. To address this imbalance, we train a random forest model on variation in the literature and use it to generate a synthetic SCC distribution that more closely matches expert assessments of appropriate model structure and discounting. This synthetic distribution has a median and mean of $185 and $284 per ton CO2, respectively, for a 2020 pulse year (5%–95% range: $32–$874), higher than all official government estimates, including a 2023 update from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32544,32544,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
Post-Neoliberal Globalization: International Trade Rules for Global Prosperity,Martin M. Guzman & Joseph E. Stiglitz,"This paper analyzes frameworks for the design of the rules for international trading, assuming that it is possible to have some rule of law. In the Arrow-Debreu benchmark, where there is no economic power and political power is seemingly irrelevant, there is no need for trade agreements – free trade is the optimal policy for each country.  But under even minimal deviations from that benchmark, trade agreements matter. We focus on environments in which there are market failures, technology is endogenous, and there is political power. Power dynamics play, for instance, a critical role in the design, implementation, and enforcement of agreements, with the latter being a critical difference between international agreements and domestic contracts and a key determinant of the feasibility and consequences of agreements.  With endogenous technology, trade rules proscribing industrial policies may lead to lower growth and greater cross-country inequalities. Finally, we develop a framework which may be useful in the design and implementation of trade rules.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32533,32533,24-Jun,NBER,6/10/2024
Why Are the Wealthiest So Wealthy? New Longitudinal Empirical Evidence and Implications for Theories of Wealth Inequality,"Elin Halvorsen, Joachim Hubmer, Serdar Ozkan, and Sergio Salgado","Correct order of authors: Hubmer, Halvorsen, Salgado, Ozkan.

We use 1993--2015 Norwegian administrative panel data on wealth and income to study lifecycle wealth dynamics. By employing a novel budget constraint approach, we show that at age 50 the excess wealth of the top 0.1%, relative to mid-wealth households, is accounted for by higher saving rates (38%), inheritances (34%), returns (23%), and labor income (5%). One-fourth of the wealthiest---the ""New Money""---start with negative wealth but experience rapid wealth growth early in life. Relative to the ""Old Money,"" the New Money are characterized by even higher saving rates, returns, and labor income. We use these dynamic facts to test six commonly used models of wealth inequality. Although these models can generate the high concentration of wealth seen in the cross-section, they tend to put too much weight on (accidental) bequests and fail to capture the contribution of the New Money. A model with heterogeneous returns that decrease in wealth, and non-homothetic preferences is consistent with the new facts on the dynamics of wealth accumulation.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-013,2024-013A,24-Jun,FED-STLOUIS,6/12/2024
"Spatial Competition, Strategic Entry Responses, and the North Dakota Railroad War of 1905",Chad Syverson,"The North Dakota Railroad War of 1905, which pitted a potential entrant (the Soo Line) against an established monopolist incumbent (the Great Northern Railway), offers a lucid empirical example of strategic behavior, and in particular the potential for entry deterrence through product proliferation. I use detailed geographic data and historical records to examine the profitability of both the incumbent’s and entrant’s potential and chosen strategies. I find that the incumbent could have likely profitably deterred entry. It did not, however, waiting instead to respond only once the entrant began building. This simultaneous entry arguably led to over expansion in the market. I investigate whether the chosen strategies may have ultimately ended up being both unprofitable for the firms involved as well as, potentially, socially wasteful.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/spatial-competition-strategic-entry-responses-and-the-north-dakota-railroad-war-of-1905/,2024-69,10-Jun-24,BFI,6/12/2024
Burn now or never? Climate change exposure and investment of fossil fuel firms,"Jakob Feveile Adolfsen, Malte Heissel, Ana-Simona Manu, Francesca Vinci","We investigate the impact of expectations about future climate policy on investment decisions of fossil fuel firms. Our empirical analysis reveals that firms with greater exposure to climate change significantly increased their investment in response to the Paris Agreement, in contrast to firms with lower exposure. Importantly, investment was directed towards traditional activities in the fossil fuel industry. By contrast, there are no indications that firms invested to transition towards renewable energy sources nor in making production less carbon-intensive.

Sovereign Green Bonds: A Catalyst for Sustainable Debt Market Development?,Gong Cheng ; Torsten Ehlers ; Frank Packer ; Yanzhe Xiao,"In traditional bond markets, sovereign bonds provide benchmarks and serve as catalysts for the corporate bond market development. Contrary to the usual sequence of bond market development, sovereign issuers are latecomers to sustainable bond markets. Yet, our empirical study finds that sovereign green bond issuance can have quantitative and qualitative benefits for the development of private sustainable bond markets. Our results suggest that both the number and the size of corporate green bond issuance increase more in a jurisdiction after the sovereign debut. The results are more pronounced in countries with stronger climate policies. Sovereign green bond issuance also improves the quality of green verification standards in the corporate bond market more generally, consistent with the aim of fostering third-party reviews and promoting best practice in green reporting and verification. Finally, our work provides evidence that the sovereign debut increases liquidity and diminishes yield spreads of corporate green bonds in the same jurisdiction.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/14/Sovereign-Green-Bonds-A-Catalyst-for-Sustainable-Debt-Market-Development-550527,2024-120,"Fri, 14 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/15/2024

Policymakers have consistently contended that deviations from price stability give rise to greater cyclical instability, and they have also frequently suggested that potential output is significantly lowered by inflation. The recurrent support for price stability that comes through in these statements implies that it is invalid to take periods in the U.S. record of deviations from price stability as indicating a policymaker belief in the desirability of inflation.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/continuity-and-change-in-the-federal-reserves-perspective-on-price-stability.htm,2024-041,24-Jun,FED-BOARD,6/15/2024

Information Friction in OTC Interdealer Markets,Benjamin Gardner and Yesol Huh,"In over-the-counter (OTC) securities markets, interdealer markets are an important venue through which dealers can offload positions and share risk amongst themselves. Contrary to the popular conception that search frictions matter the most in OTC markets, we find that in the interdealer market for U.S. corporate bonds, information frictions are most relevant. Large dealers face large and informed customers and pay more than small dealers to transact in the interdealer market, despite on average providing liquidity to other dealers.

We find that, during the first balance sheet reduction period between 2017 and 2019, dealers, households, and hedge funds bought significantly more Treasury coupons. However, during the post-pandemic balance sheet reduction period, it appears that dealers, private insurance, and the rest of the world purchased the Treasury coupon securities from the reduction in Federal Reserve purchases, not hedge funds.",https://www.federalreserve.gov//econres/notes/feds-notes/who-buys-treasuries-when-the-fed-reduces-its-holdings-20240614.html,1.02E+18,14-Jun-24,FED-BOARD-NOTES,6/15/2024
"Demand Uncertainty, Selection, and Trade",Erick Sager and Olga A. Timoshenko,"This paper examines the role of uncertainty on elasticities of trade flows with respect to variable trade costs in a canonical model of trade with monopolistic competition and heterogeneous firms. We identify two channels through which uncertainty impacts trade: through export participation thresholds (the selection effect) and the distribution of shocks governing export selection (the dispersion effect). While the selection effect dampens trade elasticities under uncertainty, the dispersion effect is ambiguous. We develop a methodology for using customs firm-level data to quantify trade elasticities under uncertainty, and the magnitude of each of the two channels through which uncertainty impacts trade. We find that uncertainty amplifies trade elasticities, on average, indicating that the dispersion effect of idiosyncratic firm-level shocks dominates -- though the effect is heterogeneous across industries. The overall magnitude of the endogenous selection mechanism on trade elasticities is small, indicating that the main drivers of trade in this class of trade models are overwhelmingly incumbent firms.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/demand-uncertainty-selection-and-trade.htm,2024-042,24-Jun,FED-BOARD,6/15/2024
A Tale of Two Margins: Monetary Policy and Capital Misallocation,Silvia Albrizio ; Beatriz Gonzalez ; Dmitry Khametshin,"This paper investigates the impact of monetary policy on capital misallocation, focusing on its heterogeneous effects on firms. Using Spanish firm-level data spanning 1999 to 2019, we demonstrate that expansionary monetary policy leads to a reduction in capital misallocation, measured by the within-industry dispersion of firms’ marginal revenue product of capital (MRPK). To analyze the underlying mechanism, we first examine the intensive margin and find that high-MRPK firms exhibit a greater increase in investment and debt financing relative to low-MRPK firms following a monetary policy easing surprise. We also find that a firm’s MRPK serves as a stronger determinant of its investment sensitivity to monetary policy than factors such as age, leverage, or cash, suggesting that MRPK is a reliable proxy for financial frictions. Next, we explore the extensive margin and demonstrate that monetary policy easing stimulates entry and discourages exit, although the quantitative impact is small. Moreover, we find no significant changes in the composition of high- and low-MRPK entrants or exiters. Overall, our findings suggest that expansionary monetary policy primarily reduces capital misallocation by alleviating financial frictions among incumbent productive and constrained firms.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/14/A-Tale-of-Two-Margins-Monetary-Policy-and-Capital-Misallocation-550533,2024-121,"Fri, 14 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/15/2024

Reaching for Duration and Leverage in the Treasury Market,"Daniel Barth, R. Jay Kahn, Phillip Monin and Oleg Sokolinskiy","We show substantial variation in mutual funds’ use of Treasury futures, both over time and across funds. This variation from mutual funds drives much of the time series variation in aggregate Treasury futures open interest, including over 60% of the recent rise in Treasury futures positions. We provide evidence these Treasury futures positions are largely attributable to mutual funds “reaching for duration” in order to track the duration of a benchmark index with high cash Treasury exposure. Specifically, we show mutual funds use futures to fill the gap between their portfolio and the index that results when they tilt their cash positions toward higher return but lower duration assets, such as mortgage-backed securities and equities, and away from cash Treasuries. Treasury futures positions are more common in mutual funds which indicate a focus on dual objectives of duration management and total return whose style has a higher allocation to Treasuries. Reaching for duration allows funds to track their index better at lower cost, but increases leverage in the Treasury market both through mutual funds long Treasury futures positions and through the leverage of hedge funds who take the corresponding short positions in Treasury futures.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/reaching-for-duration-and-leverage-in-the-treasury-market.htm,2024-039,24-Jun,FED-BOARD,6/15/2024

Aging Gracefully: Steering the Banking Sector through Demographic Shifts,Patrick A. Imam ; Christian Schmieder,"We analyze how aging populations might affect the stability of banking systems through changes in the balance sheets and risk preferences of banks over the period 2000-2022. While the anticipated decline in maturity transformation due to aging hints at a possible reduction in risk exposure, an older population may propel banks towards yield-seeking behaviors, offsetting the diminishing prominence of conventional lending operations. Through a comprehensive examination of advanced economies over the past two decades, our findings reveal a general enhancement in bank stability correlating with the aging of populations. However, the adaptive responses of banks to these demographic changes are potentially introducing tail risks. Given the rapid global shift towards aging societies, our analysis highlights the critical need for policymakers to be proactive and vigilant. This is particularly pertinent considering historical precedents where periods of relative stability have often been harbingers of emerging risks.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/14/Aging-Gracefully-Steering-the-Banking-Sector-through-Demographic-Shifts-550517,2024-118,"Fri, 14 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/15/2024
Inequality in a More Equal World—Labor Market Gender Gaps in St. Lucia,Hyunmin Park ; Swarnali A Hannan,"St. Lucia has enviably high female labor force participation rate and strikingly low participation gap vis-à-vis male. The latter is lower than OECD average and way below world average. Women are also more educated than men. Yet, using a micro dataset of St. Lucia Labor Force Survey over the period 2016-2021, our analysis points towards disproportionate effects of childcare on female participation and unemployment and a substantial gender gap in labor income for workers without higher education. Moreover, the income gap is not explained by observable worker characteristics. While the paper does not explore causal links, this unique feature of high female participation and, yet, considerable gender gaps in other dimensions could be due to the social, historical, and political structure that resulted in a matrifocal but not a matriarchal system. At the same time, the small gender gaps for workers with higher education across participation, unemployment, and labor income seem to suggest that women can overcome some barriers through education. Our results bring to the fore two crucial aspects related to gender studies: (i) While macroeconomic indicators like female labor participation rate are important tools, they are not always sufficient to capture progress in gender equality; and (ii) econometric analysis needs to be complemented with a more holistic understanding of the history and social context shaping deeply rooted gender traits.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/14/Inequality-in-a-More-Equal-World-Labor-Market-Gender-Gaps-in-St-550512,2024-117,"Fri, 14 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/15/2024

We uncover three key findings. First, our high-frequency data confirm that banks with high reliance on uninsured deposits and large unrealized losses on securities holdings suffered larger deposit outflows at the onset of the episode. Second, the BTFP played an outsized role in meeting these outflows at banks with larger securities losses, reflecting the at-par valuation of securities collateral at the BTFP (banks at the 90th percentile in securities losses replaced 26 cents of every dollar of outflows with BTFP borrowing, compared to only 7 cents on average). Third, in addition to funding loan growth and deposit outflows, banks used the BTFP to build cash holdings, indicating that the program enabled banks to position themselves against potential future funding needs.

Traumatic Financial Experiences and Persistent Changes in Financial Behavior: Evidence from the Freedman's Savings Bank,"Vellore Arthi, Gary Richardson & Mark Van Orden","The failure of the Freedman's Savings Bank (FSB), one of the only Black-serving banks in the early post-bellum South, was an economic catastrophe and one of the great episodes of racial exploitation in post-Emancipation history. It was also most Black Americans' first experience of banking. Can events like these permanently alter financial preferences and behavior? To test this, we examine the impact of FSB collapse on life insurance-holding, an accessible alternative savings vehicle over the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We document a sharp and persistent increase in insurance demand in affected counties following the shock, driven disproportionately by Black customers. We also use FSB migrant flows to disentangle place-based and cohort-based effects, thus identifying psychological and cultural scarring as a distinct mechanism underlying the shift in financial behavior induced by the bank's collapse. Horizontal and intergenerational transmission of preferences help explain the shock’s persistent effects on financial behavior.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32576,32576,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
"Book-Value Wealth Taxation, Capital Income Taxation, and Innovation","Fatih Guvenen, Gueorgui Kambourov, Burhan Kuruscu & Sergio Ocampo-Diaz","When is a wealth tax preferable to a capital income tax? When is the opposite true? More generally, can capital taxation be structured to improve productivity, incentivize innovation, and ultimately increase welfare? We study these questions theoretically in an infinite-horizon model with entrepreneurs and workers, in which entrepreneurial firms differ in their productivity and are subject to collateral constraints. The stationary equilibrium features heterogeneous returns and misallocation of capital. We show that increasing the wealth tax increases aggregate productivity. The gains result from the “use-it-or-lose-it” effect of wealth taxes when returns are heterogeneous, which causes a reallocation of capital from entrepreneurs with low productivity to those with high productivity. Furthermore, if the capital income tax is adjusted to balance the government's budget, aggregate capital, output, and wages also increase. We then study the welfare maximizing combination of wealth and capital income taxes and show that the optimal mix shifts towards a higher wealth tax and a lower capital income tax as the capital intensity of production increases. For a range of plausible parameter values, the optimal wealth tax is positive, whereas the capital income tax can be positive or negative (a subsidy). We then endogenize the entrepreneurial productivity distribution by introducing either ex ante innovation or entrepreneurial effort in production and show that this strengthens our results: by allowing entrepreneurs to keep more of the upside relative to a capital income tax, a wealth tax incentivizes more innovation and entrepreneurial effort, leading to larger increases in productivity, output, and welfare.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32585,32585,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Preschool Lottery Admissions and Its Effects on Long-Run Earnings and Outcomes,Randall Akee & Leah R.

We observe long-run outcomes by linking both admitted and non-admitted individuals to confidential administrative data including tax records. Funding for this preschool program comes from an Indigenous organization, which grants Indigenous students admissions preference and free tuition. We find treated children have between 5 to 6 percent higher earnings as young adults. The results are quite large for young women, especially those from the lower half of the initial parental household income distribution. There is also some evidence that children, regardless of gender, from households with below median parental incomes realize the largest average increases in earnings in adulthood. Finally, we find that increased earnings start at ages 21 and older for the treated students.

"Dynamic Models, New Gains from Trade?","Christoph Boehm, Andrei A. Levchenko, Nitya Pandalai-Nayar & Hiroshi Toma","Yes. We state closed-form expressions for steady state gains from trade that apply in a class of dynamic trade models that includes dynamic versions of the Krugman (1980), Melitz (2003), and customer capital (e.g., Arkolakis, 2010) models. The gains are a function of the domestic trade share and the long-run elasticity of trade with respect to iceberg trade costs, similar to Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodríguez-Clare (2012). In contrast to static settings, in a dynamic world this long-run elasticity cannot be estimated in one step by relying on tariff variation as shifters of trade costs. We show, instead, that this object can be recovered by combining two tariff elasticity estimates: the long- and the short-run. Thus, the short-run tariff elasticity indirectly enters the formula for the steady state gains from trade. Our main substantive finding is that the gains from trade are large. They depend crucially on the short-run tariff elasticity, and can be arbitrarily large even if the long-run tariff elasticity is high. Accounting for the transition path has a minor impact on the magnitude of the gains from trade, relative to simply comparing steady states.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32565,32565,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Sufficient Statistics for Measuring Forward-Looking Welfare,"David Baqaee, Ariel Burstein & Yasutaka Koike-Mori","We provide a method to measure welfare, in money-metric terms, taking into account expectations about the future. Our two key assumptions are that (1) the expenditure function is separable between the present and the future, and (2) there are some households that do not face idiosyncratic undiversifiable risk. Our sufficient statistics methodology allows for incomplete markets, lifecycle motives, non-rational expectations, non-exponential time discounting, and arbitrary functional forms. To apply our formulas, we require estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, goods and services’ prices over time, and repeated cross-sectional information on households’ income, balance sheets, and expenditures. We illustrate our method using the PSID from the United States. We find that static measures overstate cost-of-living increases for most households, particularly younger and poorer households. Our estimates can be used to study the welfare consequences of dynamic stochastic shocks that affect households along different margins and time horizons. For example, we find that involuntary job loss is associated with a 20% reduction in money-metric utility for households younger than 60 years old.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32567,32567,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Automating Short-Term Payroll Savings: Evidence from Two Large U.K. Experiments,"Sarah Holmes Berk, James J.

What are the effects of using it (or, alternatively, requiring an active enrollment choice) to increase short-term savings? We evaluate two experiments in the U.K. at employers that enable workers to set up payroll contributions to fund short-term savings accounts. In the first experiment (N = 7,404), employees at two firms were randomly assigned opt-in, opt-out, or active choice enrollment into the short-term savings program. Nine months later, participation was 48 percentage points higher under automatic enrollment than opt-in enrollment, and average balances were £114 higher. In the second experiment (N = 3,605), after years of offering opt-in payroll contributions to fund a short-term savings account, the employer changed to opt-out enrollment for new hires only.

We show theoretically that fiscal transfers without future tax increases cause a surge in inflation, increasing consumption demand and house prices.  The power of fiscal stimulus grows when borrowers are more indebted.  We then show quantitatively that transfers followed by easy monetary policy cause a surge in inflation which helps explain features of the post-Covid boom, including a boom in output and house prices.

Female-owned establishments were smaller than male-owned establishments and had lower capital-to-output ratios, which could reflect more-constrained financial access and other distortions.  Female-owned establishments employed more women and paid women higher wages, creating a potential cycle between increased female business ownership and increased female labor market participation.  Female-owned establishments concentrated in sub-industries like women's clothing and millinery, which is associated with some but not all of these differences.

Responding to a request for help, we conducted a field study in Mexican labor courts in which time pressure on the judges leads to their making mistakes, many of which are appealed. All we did was to index pages to random case files to help judges quickly find relevant information. We made no other changes whatsoever. Our treatment greatly reduced successful appeals, fully 50% in complex cases, and resulted in judicial opinions that were shorter and more on point.

Heterogeneity and Aggregate Fluctuations: Insights from TANK Models,Davide Debortoli & Jordi Galí,"We analyze the merits and limitations of simple tractable New Keynesian models (RANK and TANK) in accounting for the aggregate predictions of Heterogenous Agent New Keynesian models (HANK). By means of comparison of a number of nested HANK models, we investigate the role played by (i) idiosyncratic income risk, (ii) a binding borrowing constraint, and (iii) a portfolio choice between liquid and illiquid assets. We argue that the effects of household heterogeneity can be largely understood looking at the differential behavior of two types of households: hand-to-mouth and unconstrained. We find that a suitably specified and calibrated TANK model (which abstracts from idiosyncratic income risk) can capture reasonably well the aggregate implications of household heterogeneity and the main channels through which it operates. That ability increases in the presence of a policy rule that emphasizes inflation stability. In the limiting case of a strict inflation targeting policy, heterogeneity becomes irrelevant for the determination of aggregate output.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32557,32557,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Statistical Discrimination and the Distribution of Wages,"Prashant Bharadwaj, Rahul Deb & Ludovic Renou","We characterize the conditions under which the wage distributions for two groups are consistent with a general model of statistical discrimination. We adapt this theoretical characterization to develop a novel empirical test, the rejection of which we interpret as evidence of taste-based discrimination. In doing so, we provide a theoretical foundation via which the wage structure effect in the decomposition of wage distributions can be interpreted as evidence of taste-based discrimination. We provide a proof of concept application using Census and NLSY-79 data, which suggests taste-based discrimination at work against Black male workers in several broad occupation categories.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32562,32562,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Financial Incentives for Adoption and Kin Guardianship Improve Achievement for Foster Children,"David Simon, Aaron Sojourner, Jon Pedersen & Heidi Ombisa Skallet","This paper reports new evidence that giving financial rewards for adopting a child from foster care or becoming a kin guardian improves the later school performance of these children. It uses linked administrative data to examine a policy change in Minnesota. This change increased the payments to adoptive parents and kin guardians for children ages 6 and older, making them equal to what foster care payments were, but didn't raise payments as much for younger children. Difference-in-differences analysis shows that this policy of equalizing payments increased the average academic achievement of foster children by 31 percent of a standard deviation three years after their cases began. Additionally, the policy raised the total value of payments to these children by about $2,000 during this period. It also led to a 29 percent increase in the monthly chance of moving from foster care to adoption or kin guardianship, improved school stability, and reduced school suspensions. This research contributes to the limited evidence on how financial incentives can encourage adoptions and is one of the first to provide evidence of its positive effects on outcomes beyond the child welfare system.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32560,32560,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Turbocharging Profits? Contract Gaming and Revenue Allocation in Healthcare,"Atul Gupta, Ambar La Forgia & Adam Sacarny","Firms often exploit loopholes in government contracts to boost revenues. The welfare consequences of this behavior depend on how firms use the marginal windfall dollar, yet little evidence exists to guide policymakers. This paper studies how hospitals allocated over $3 billion obtained from gaming a Medicare payment loophole. The average gaming hospital increased both Medicare and total revenue by around 10%, implying large spillovers on other payers. Consistent with theories of organizational behavior, nonprofit hospitals deployed most of the windfall toward operating costs, while for-profits deducted the entire amount off their balance sheet, distributing a substantial portion to executives and shareholders. Accordingly, we detect modest reductions in mortality rates at nonprofits but no changes at for-profits. Our results imply that the consequences of such engineered windfalls vary substantially by hospital ownership.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32564,32564,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
International Policy Coordination in a Multisectoral Model of Trade and Health Policy,"Viral V. Acharya, Zhengyang Jiang, Robert J. Richmond & Ernst-Ludwig Von Thadden","We analyze international trade and health policy coordination during a pandemic by developing a two-economy, two-sector trade model integrated into a micro-founded SIR model of infection dynamics.  Disease transmission intensity can differ by goods (manufactured versus services and domestic versus foreign). Governments can adopt containment policies to suppress infection spread domestically, and levy import tariffs to prevent infection from abroad. The globally coordinated policy dynamically adjusts both policy instruments heterogeneously across sectors. The more-infected country aggressively contains the pandemic, raising tariffs and tilting the terms of trade in its favor, while the less-infected country lowers tariffs to share its economic pain. In contrast, in the Nash equilibrium of uncoordinated policies the more infected country does not internalize the global spread of the pandemic, lowering tariffs and its terms of trade,  especially in the contact-intensive services sector, while the less infected country counters the spread by raising tariffs. Coordination therefore matters: the health-cum-trade war leads to less consumption and production, as well as smaller health gains due to inadequate global diversification of infection curves.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32566,32566,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
School Closures and Parental Mental Health,"Sumedha Gupta, Dario Salcedo & Kosali I. Simon","Schools enhance the lives of families in various ways, and one potential consequence of their closures is worsened parental well-being. We study the effects of COVID-19 pandemic school closures on parental mental health by measuring consumption of products that are often used to cope with increased stress and depression. Using a cohort based difference in difference (DID) design and commercial claims data, we find an increase in maternal anti-depressant use by 1.5%, in zip codes with above median school closures; there are no statistically significant effects for paternal antidepressant use, and we are able to rule out fairly small values. Some parents may ""self-medicate"" as a coping mechanism rather than seek formal medical care. Using a county based DID design and retail scanner data, we find alcohol sales increased by 2% in counties with above median school closures. Both anti-depressant prescriptions and alcohol sales returned to base line levels as in-person schooling resumed. We explore whether the burdens of school closures were disparately concentrated in minoritized communities, and find that anti-depressant and alcohol use increases were concentrated in zip codes with above median Black and Asian populations, but not in zip codes with a predominantly White or Hispanic population. Overall, these results suggest that the school system plays an important role in maintaining population mental well-being outcomes and in helping families cope with stress.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32516,32516,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
U.S. Liquid Government Liabilities and Emerging Market Capital Flows,Annie Soyean Lee & Charles Engel,"Empirical work finds that flows of investments from the U.S. and other high income countries to emerging markets increase during times of quantitative easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and the reverse movement occurs under quantitative tightening. We offer new evidence to confirm these findings, and then propose a theory based on the liquidity of U.S. government liabilities held by the public. We hypothesize that QE, by increasing liquidity, offers greater flexibility for investors that might be concerned their funds will be tied up when shocks to income or investment opportunities arise. With the assurance that some of their portfolio can be readily sold in liquid markets, rich country investors are more willing to increase investments in illiquid loans to emerging markets. The effect of increasing the liquidity of U.S. government liabilities on investments in EMs may even be stronger during times of greater uncertainty.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32572,32572,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Property Insurance and Disaster Risk: New Evidence from Mortgage Escrow Data,Benjamin J. Keys & Philip Mulder,"We develop a new dataset to study homeowners insurance. Our data on over 47 million observations of households’ property insurance expenditures from 2014-2023 are inferred from mortgage escrow payments. First, we find a sharp 33% increase in average premiums from 2020 to 2023 (13% in real terms) that is highly uneven across geographies. This growth is associated with a stronger relationship between premiums and local disaster risk: A one standard-deviation increase in disaster risk is associated with $500 higher premiums in 2023, up from $300 in 2018. Second, using the rapid rise in reinsurance prices as a natural experiment, we show that the increase in the risk-to-premium gradient was largely caused by the pass-through of reinsurance costs. Third, we project that if the reinsurance shock persists, growing disaster risk will lead climate-exposed households to face $700 higher annual premiums by 2053. Our results highlight that prices in global reinsurance markets pass through to household budgets, and will ultimately drive the cost of rising climate risk.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32579,32579,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Career Expectations and Outcomes: Evidence (on Gender Gaps) from the Economics Job Market,"Brooke Helppie McFall, Eric D. Parolin & Basit Zafar","This paper investigates gender gaps in long-term career expectations and outcomes of PhD candidates in economics. For this purpose, we match rich survey data on PhD candidates (from the 2008-2010 job market cohorts) to public data on job histories and publication records through 2022. We document four novel empirical facts: (1) there is a robust gender gap in career expectations, with females about 10 percentage points less likely to ex-ante expect to get tenure or publish regularly; (2) the gender gap in expectations is remarkably similar to the gap observed for academic outcomes; (3) expectations are similarly predictive of outcomes for males and females. In addition, the predictive power of expectations does not differ by the relationship status of the individual; and (4) gender gaps in expectations can explain about 19% and 13% of the ex-post gaps in tenure and publications, respectively.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32446,32446,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
The Impact of Price Transparency in Outpatient Provider Markets,"Kayleigh Barnes, Sherry A. Glied, Benjamin R. Handel & Grace Kim","Medical provider price transparency is often touted as a way to lower health care spending. But the impact of price transparency is theoretically ambiguous: it could lower health care spending via increased consumer price shopping or improved insurer bargaining but could also raise health care prices via improved provider bargaining or provider collusion. We conduct a randomized-controlled trial to examine the impact of a state-wide medical charge transparency tool in outpatient provider markets in New York State. In the experiment, individual providers’ billed charges (list prices) were released randomly at the level of the procedure and three-digit zipcode. We use a comprehensive commercial claims database to assess the impact of this intervention and find that it leads to a small increase in overall billed charges (+0.75%). This effect is concentrated among low-priced providers in markets with low out-of-network spending, suggesting that the transparency tool improves provider pricing information. We find no evidence of quantity effects. Results do not vary consistently across specialty groups, market concentration, frequency of service use, or frequency of website use. These results are consistent with price transparency having a minimal effect on consumer shopping while slightly improving provider information about competitors’ charges.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32580,32580,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
"Political Connections, Allocation of Stimulus Spending, and the Jobs Multiplier","Joonkyu Choi, Veronika Penciakova & Felipe Saffie","We study the role of firms’ political influence on the effectiveness of government spending using ARRA as a laboratory. Through an IV approach, we show that a 10 percentage points increase in the share of politically connected spending lowers the job creation effect of stimulus by 33 percent at the state level. We exploit ex-post close state-level elections to establish that firms that contributed to winning candidates create fewer jobs after winning grants. Using a quantitative general equilibrium model, we show that politically connected spending also lowers the aggregate jobs multiplier, and that the dampening effect is rationalized by connected firms charging higher markups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32574,32574,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Extraordinary Labor Market Developments and the 2022-23 Disinflation,Steven J. Davis,"Two extraordinary U.S. labor market developments facilitated the sharp disinflation in 2022-23 without raising the unemployment rate. First, pandemic-driven infection worries and social distancing intentions caused a sizable drag on labor force participation that began to reverse in the first quarter of 2022, and perhaps earlier. As the reversal unfolded, it raised labor supply and reduced wage growth. Second, the pandemic-instigated shift to work from home (WFH) raised the amenity value of employment in many jobs and for many workers. This development lowered wage-growth pressures along the transition path to a new equilibrium with pay packages that recognized higher remote work levels and their benefits to workers. Surveys of business executives imply that the shift to WFH lowered average wage growth by two percentage points from spring 2021 to spring 2023. A direct inspection finds that average real wage growth from 2021 Q1 to 2024 Q1 in the U.S. economy was at least 3.5 to 4.4 ppts below the path suggested by pre-pandemic experience. This large shortfall in real wage growth aligns well with the interpretation of the 2022-23 disinflation offered here.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32584,32584,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Rent Guarantee Insurance,Boaz Abramson & Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh,"A rent guarantee insurance (RGI) policy makes a limited number of rent payments to the landlord on behalf of an insured tenant unable to pay rent due to a negative income or health expenditure shock. We introduce RGI in a rich quantitative equilibrium model of housing insecurity and show it increases welfare by improving risk sharing across idiosyncratic and aggregate states of the world, reducing the need for a large security deposits, and reducing homelessness which imposes large costs on society. While unrestricted access is not financially viable with either private or public insurance providers due to moral hazard and adverse selection, restricting access can restore viability. Private insurers must target better off renters to break even, while public insurers focus on households most at-risk of homelessness.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32582,32582,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
The Chronic Disease Index: Analyzing Health Inequalities Over the Lifecycle,"Kaveh Danesh, Jonathan T. Kolstad, Johannes Spinnewijn & William D. Parker","The rich live longer than the poor, but relatively little is known about the evolution of health inequality across the lifecycle. Using rich administrative data from the Netherlands, we develop an index of chronic disease burden based on the projected contribution to old-age mortality. Chronic conditions account for one-third of the mortality gap in old age. Using our index we demonstrate that health inequality arises much earlier in life; by age 35, the bottom half of the income distribution has the same disease burden as those age 50 in the top half. Approximately 60% of the divergence across income groups is due to low-income individuals developing chronic illness at a faster rate, rather than chronically ill individuals sorting into lower-income groups. Using linked health survey data, we then examine the contributions of various mediators to the incidence of chronic diseases over the life cycle. Socioeconomic and geographic factors explain most of the variation, while individual health behaviors play a moderate role. Our findings align with calls to target health policies toward early-life social determinants of health.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32577,32577,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Fertility Beliefs and Outcomes: The Role of Relationship Status and Attractiveness,"Yifan Gong, Tyler Skura, Ralph Stinebrickner & Todd R.

Comparing outcomes and beliefs yields a measure of belief accuracy. Individuals who are unmarried and not in relationships at age 24 are extremely optimistic about the probability of having children, while married individuals have very accurate beliefs. Novel attractiveness measures are central for understanding fertility beliefs and outcomes for females but not for males. Marriage is a mechanism that is relevant for understanding differences in beliefs, outcomes, and misperceptions across relationship and attractiveness groups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32578,32578,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Does the EITC Reduce Caregiving for Parents?,"Katherine Michelmore, Anna Wiersma Strauss & Emily E. Wiemers","Families provide substantial care to older adults with functional limitations. Policies that incentivize work have the potential to reduce this valuable care. This study uses the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and a simulated instrument approach to examine the consequences of increases in the generosity of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), a work-contingent cash benefit, for the care that parents receive from their EITC-eligible daughters. We find that increases in EITC generosity reduce the care that parents receive from their EITC-eligible daughters, especially older parents and those with functional limitations. To assess the full effect of this reduction in caregiving, we examine whether financial transfers increase as a substitute for reduced care, whether other adult children fill the care gap left by EITC-eligible daughters, and whether paid caregiving increases in response to declines in family care. We find no evidence of increased financial transfers and care gaps remain for older parents that are not filled by other children or paid care providers. We conclude that an unintended consequence of the EITC is that the older parents of EITC recipients receive less care from their children overall in response to increased EITC benefit generosity.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32583,32583,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
In Their Shoes,"Marianne Andries, Leonardo Bursztyn, Thomas Chaney & Milena Djourelova","We explore the mechanics of empathy. In a controlled immersive virtual reality experiment, we show that neutral information on unauthorized immigration magnifies the empathetic response of subjects when they witness the struggles of unauthorized migrants. We conjecture that perceiving others as similar magnifies empathy: it makes it possible to live their experience as if one were ‘in their shoes.’ In a separate, incentivized experiment, we show that the same neutral information increases perceived similarity to unauthorized migrants. We provide similar evidence in observational data, showing that contact with a given foreign origin group induces a greater empathetic response – more charitable donations – after the country of origin of this group is hit by a natural disaster, and a higher perceived similarity to this group. Together, our evidence suggests that the ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person or group can be enhanced through standard policy tools such as neutral information provision and inter-group contact.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32569,32569,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Effects of the Expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for Childless Young Adults on Material Wellbeing,"Jiwan Lee, Katherine Michelmore, Natasha Pilkauskas & Christopher Wimer","In 2021, the U.S. Congress temporarily expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without a qualifying child (childless EITC), to help counteract the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lower-wage working adults. This expansion roughly tripled the maximum benefits for qualifying filers and lowered the minimum age to claim the credit from 25 to 19, providing new benefits to low-income young adults. Using data from the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey and a difference-in-differences design, this study is among the first to examine the impact of the expanded childless EITC on young adults’ material hardship (food, housing, and expenses). We find that the temporary expansion led to a significant decrease in housing hardship among low-income, childless, young adults, and suggestive evidence that it also reduced food insufficiency and difficulty with expenses. Overall our findings show that the temporary expansion of the childless EITC helped reduce material hardship among young adults.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32571,32571,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Dynamic Targeting: Experimental Evidence from Energy Rebate Programs,"Takanori Ida, Takunori Ishihara, Koichiro Ito, Daido Kido, Toru Kitagawa, Shosei Sakaguchi & Shusaku Sasaki","Economic policies often involve dynamic interventions, where individuals receive repeated interventions over multiple periods. This dynamics makes past responses informative to predict future responses and ultimate outcomes depend on the history of interventions. Despite these phenomena, existing economic studies typically focus on static targeting, possibly overlooking key information from dynamic interventions. We develop a framework for designing optimal dynamic targeting that maximizes social welfare gains from dynamic policy intervention. Our framework can be applied to experimental or quasi-experimental data with sequential randomization. We demonstrate that dynamic targeting can outperform static targeting through several key mechanisms: learning, habit formation, and screening effects. We then propose methods to empirically identify these effects. By applying this method to a randomized controlled trial on a residential energy rebate program, we show that dynamic targeting significantly outperforms conventional static targeting, leading to improved social welfare gains. We observe significant heterogeneity in the learning, habit formation, and screening effects, and illustrate how our approach leverages this heterogeneity to design optimal dynamic targeting.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32561,32561,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Fighting Abuse with Prescription Tracking: Mandatory Drug Monitoring and Intimate Partner Violence,"Dhaval M. Dave, Bilge Erten, David W. Hummel, Pinar Keskin & Shuo Zhang","The opioid crisis generates broader societal harms beyond direct health and economic effects, impacting non-users through adverse spillovers on children, families, and communities. We study the spillover effects of a supply-side policy aimed at reducing the over-prescribing of opioids on women’s wellbeing by examining its effects on intimate partner violence (IPV). Using administrative data on incidents reported to law enforcement, in conjunction with quasi-experimental variation in the adoption of stringent mandatory access prescription drug monitoring programs, we find that these policies have generated a downstream benefit for women by significantly reducing their overall exposure to IPV and IPV-involved injuries by 9 to 10 percent. Strongest effects are experienced by groups with higher rates of opioid consumption at baseline, including non-Hispanic Whites. However, we also find a significant uptick in heroin-involved IPV incidents, suggesting substitution into illicit drug consumption. Our results highlight the need to identify high-risk groups prone to switching to illicit opioids and to address this risk through evidence-based policies. Accounting for effects on IPV adds to the estimated societal burden of the opioid epidemic.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32563,32563,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Optimal Age-based Policies for Pandemics: An Economic Analysis of Covid-19 and Beyond,"Luiz Brotherhood, Philipp Kircher, Cezar Santos & Michèle Tertilt","This paper investigates the importance of the age composition for pandemic policy design. To do so, it introduces an economic framework with age heterogeneity, individual choice, and incomplete information, emphasizing the value of testing. Calibrating the model to the US Covid-19 pandemic reveals an 80% reduction in death toll due to voluntary actions and the lockdown implemented in the US. The optimal lockdown, however, is more stringent than what was implemented in the US. Moreover, the social planner follows an asymmetric approach by locking down the young relatively more than the old. We underscore the importance of testing, showing its impact on reduced deaths, lower economic costs and laxer lockdown. We use the framework to provide systematic insights into pandemics caused by different viruses (among others the Spanish flu), and underline the influence of economic conditions on optimal policies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32558,32558,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Custom Proxy Voting Advice,"Edwin Hu, Nadya Malenko & Jonathon Zytnick","This paper studies institutional investors’ decision-making using novel data from a major proxy advisor. We highlight the significant role of customized proxy advice in shaping shareholders’ voting decisions. About 80% of funds receive customized advice, and custom recommendations differ substantially from benchmark recommendations. We show that customization plays two key roles. First, it helps shareholders express their ideologies through the vote. Second, it facilitates shareholders’ decision-making process by reducing the need to pay attention to every proposal individually and enabling focus on the more important proposals. Customization thus influences both the aggregation of preferences and the aggregation of information in voting outcomes. Our findings offer a new perspective on the role of proxy advisors and suggest a shift away from solely focusing on benchmark recommendations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32559,32559,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024
Market Design in Regulated Health Insurance Markets: Risk Adjustment vs. Subsidies,"Liran Einav, Amy Finkelstein & Pietro Tebaldi","Health insurance is increasingly provided through managed competition, in which subsidies for consumers and risk adjustment for insurers are key market design instruments. We illustrate that subsidies offer two advantages over risk adjustment in markets with adverse selection. They provide greater flexibility in tailoring premiums to heterogeneous buyers, and they produce equilibria with lower markups and greater enrollment. We assess these effects using demand and cost estimates from the California Affordable Care Act marketplace. Holding government spending fixed, we estimate that subsidies can increase enrollment by 16 percentage points (76%) over risk adjustment, while all consumers are weakly better off.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32586,32586,24-Jun,NBER,6/17/2024

Default and Interest Rate Shocks: Renegotiation Matters,"Victor Almeida, Carlos Esquivel, Timothy J. Kehoe, Juan Pablo Nicolini","We develop a sovereign default model with debt renegotiation in which interest-rate shocks affect default incentives through two mechanisms. The first mechanism, the standard mechanism, depends on how a higher interest rate tightens the government’s budget constraint. The second mechanism, the renegotiation mechanism, depends on how a higher rate increases lenders’ opportunity cost of holding delinquent debt, which makes lenders accept larger haircuts and makes default more attractive for the government. We use the model to study the 1982 Mexican default, which followed a large increase in U.S. interest rates. We argue that our novel renegotiation mechanism is key for reconciling standard sovereign default models with the narrative that U.S. monetary tightening triggered the crisis.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/working-papers/default-and-interest-rate-shocks-renegotiation-matters,806,17-Jun-24,FED-MINNEAPOLIS,6/18/2024
The Pass-through of Gaps between Market Rent and the Price of Shelter,Christopher D. Cotton,"The gap between market rent and the price of shelter was 6.6 percent larger in December 2023 relative to December 2019. Because shelter prices comprise 36 percent of the Consumer Price Index and therefore influence monetary policy decisions, it is vital to understand the pass-through of this difference, or “market-shelter gap.” I use MSA-level variation to answer this question. When there is a positive market–shelter gap, the price of shelter grows faster and market rent grows slower until the gap closes, which takes about five years. Faster shelter-price growth and slower market-rent growth each explain about half of the convergence.",https://www.bostonfed.org//publications/research-department-working-paper/2024/the-pass-through-of-gaps-between-market-rent-and-the-price-of-shelter.aspx,24-6,6/12/2024,FED-BOSTON,6/18/2024
The impact of environmental regulation on clean innovation: are there crowding out effects?,"Nicola Benatti, Martin Groiss, Petra Kelly, Paloma Lopez-Garcia","We examine the extent to which environmental regulation affects innovation and which policy types provide the strongest incentives to innovate. Using a local projection framework, we estimate the regulatory impact on patenting activity over a five-year horizon. As a proxy for environmental policy exposure, we estimate firm-level greenhouse gas emissions using a machine learning algorithm. At the country-level, policy tightening is largely associated with no statistically significant change in environmental technology innovation. At the firm-level, however, environmental policy tightening leads to higher innovation activity in technologies mitigating climate change, while the effect on innovation in other technologies is muted. This suggests that environmental regulation does not lead to a crowding-out of non-clean innovations. The policy type matters, as increasing the stringency of technology support policies and non-market based policies leads to increases in clean technology patenting, while we do not find a statistically significant impact of market-based policies.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2946~844af1ac30.en.pdf?d62d13f0434d594676f3ec7f23b616bb,2946,17-Jun-24,ECB,6/18/2024
The wage-price pass-through across sectors: evidence from the euro area,"Miguel Ampudia, Marco Jacopo Lombardi, Théodore Renault","This paper studies the pass-through from wages to producer prices using sectoral disaggregated data for the euro area. We find a positive and statistically significant wage-price pass-through that reaches 50% after three years, which differs across sectors. The wage-price pass-through in private servicesis significantly higher than in industry and takes longer before reaching its peak. While a higher labour intensity is a key component of the pass-through, our estimates indicate that differences in sectoral labour shares alone cannot explain the larger wage-price pass-through in private services compared to industry. Instead, the estimates hint at an important role for international competition in the domestic market for the tradeable sector. They also suggest that the sales destination matters: wage growth contributes to domestic inflation for goods but not to export inflation. Finally, we also provide evidence of an increase in the wage-price pass-through after 2020, particularly in private services.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2948~bb4dede124.en.pdf?36eb1043dd50a338b12d3edf63bfb478,2948,18-Jun-24,ECB,6/19/2024

"Historical Differences in Female-Owned Manufacturing Establishments: The United  States, 1850-1880","Ruveyda Gozen, Richard Hornbeck, Anders Humlum, Martin Rotemberg","We characterize female-owned manufacturing establishments using newly digitized manuscripts from the US Census of Manufactures (1850, 1860, 1870, 1880). Female-owned establishments were smaller than male-owned establishments and had lower capital-to-output ratios, which could reflect more-constrained financial access and other distortions. Female-owned establishments employed more women and paid women higher wages, creating a potential cycle between increased female business ownership and increased female labor market participation. Female-owned establishments concentrated in sub-industries like women’s clothing and millinery, which is associated with some but not all of these differences.

In Their Shoes,"Marianne Andries, Leonardo Bursztyn, Thomas Chaney, Milena Djourelova","We explore the mechanics of empathy. In a controlled immersive virtual reality experiment, we show that neutral information on unauthorized immigration magnifies the empathetic response of subjects when they witness the struggles of unauthorized migrants. We conjecture that perceiving others as similar magnifies empathy: it makes it possible to live their experience as if one were ‘in their shoes.’ In a separate, incentivized experiment, we show that the same neutral information increases perceived similarity to unauthorized migrants. We provide similar evidence in observational data, showing that contact with a given foreign origin group induces a greater empathetic response – more charitable donations – after the country of origin of this group is hit by a natural disaster, and a higher perceived similarity to this group. Together, our evidence suggests that the ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person or group can be enhanced through standard policy tools such as neutral information provision and inter-group contact.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/in-their-shoes/,2024-74,18-Jun-24,BFI,6/19/2024
Productivity-enhancing reallocation during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Tibor Lalinsky, Jaanika Meriküll, Paloma Lopez-Garcia","This paper studies how the Covid-19 pandemic and the extensive job retention support that accompanied it affected productivity in Europe. The focus is on the reallocation channel and productivity-enhancing reallocation of jobs, following Foster et al., 2016. An extensive micro-distributed analysis of firm-level data for 11 euro area countries is used. The unique firm-level datasets are constructed by merging balance-sheet and income-statement data with policy support data. The paper exploits variation in employment responsiveness to productivity over time, particularly examining the relationship between changes in employment responsiveness and the job retention support in 2020 and studying how well the support was targeted by firm productivity. Acknowledging limitations of a small set of countries covered and occasionally large confidence bounds around estimates, the findings suggest that (1) productivity-enhancing reallocation was weaker in the pandemic than in the Great Recession; (2) The countries that were more generous with job retention support and countries where more support was allocated to low-productivity firms showed weaker productivity-enhancing reallocation in 2020.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2947~339ed63d7b.en.pdf?277942012555ecebc1d51d9e2f34895d,2947,18-Jun-24,ECB,6/19/2024

The St. Louis Fed DSGE Model,Miguel Faria e Castro,"This document contains a technical description of the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model developed and maintained by the Research Division of the St. Louis Fed as one of its tools for forecasting and policy analysis. The St. Louis Fed model departs from an otherwise standard medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model along two main dimensions: first, it allows for household heterogeneity, in the form of workers and capitalists, who have different marginal propensities to consume (MPC). Second, it explicitly models a fiscal sector endowed with multiple spending and revenue instruments, such as social transfers and distortionary income taxes. Both of these features make the model well-suited for the analysis of fiscal policy counterfactuals, and monetary-fiscal interactions. We describe how the model is estimated using historical data for the US economy and how the COVID-19 pandemic is accounted for.

"Uncertainty, Social Valuation, and Climate Change Policy","Michael Barnett, William Brock, Hong Zhang, Lars Peter Hansen","Uncertainty, as it pertains to climate change and other policy challenges, oper-ates through multiple channels. Such challenges are commonly framed using social valuations such as the social cost of climate change and the social value of research and development. These valuations have contributions that vary across horizons. We propose decompositions when the nature of this uncertainty is broadly conceived. By drawing on insights from decision theory, stochastic impulse response theory, and the pricing of uncertain cash flows, we provide novel characterizations.

Their findings revise several stylized facts about U.S. housing markets. Real market rents did not fall during the 20th century for most cities. Instead, real rental price levels increased by about 20 percent from 1890 to 2006. There was also greater growth in real housing sales prices from 1965 to 1995 than is commonly understood. Using these series, the authors document several new facts about housing markets. The return to homeownership has varied considerably across cities and over time, but rental returns were historically much more important than capital gains in every city.

In cases with multiplicity, the lowest rental rate occurs near depreciation times the capital share. It is possible for the economy, without a change in fundamentals, to transition rationally from a higher-rate equilibrium to one with a lower rental rate, lower inequality, and lower welfare (for most agents).

Post-pandemic Productivity Dynamics in the United States,Mai Dao ; Josef Platzer,"We study U.S. labor productivity growth and its drivers since the COVID-19 pandemic. Labor productivity experienced large swings since 2020, due to both compositional and within-industry effects, but has since returned to its pre-pandemic trend. Industry-level panel regressions show that measures of labor market churn are associated with higher productivity growth both in the cross-section and over time. Sectors with higher investment in digitalization, particularly in teleworkable industries, also experience higher productivity growth on average.

Macroeconomic Expectations and Cognitive Noise,Yeji Sung,"This paper examines forecast biases through cognitive noise, moving beyond the conventional view that frictions emerge solely from using external data. By extending Sims’s (2003) imperfect attention model to include imperfect memory, I propose a framework where cognitive constraints impact both external and internal information use. This innovation reveals horizon-dependent forecast sensitivity: short-term forecasts adjust sluggishly while long-term forecasts may overreact. I explore the macroeconomic impact of this behavior, showing how long-term expectations, heavily influenced by current economic conditions, heighten inflation volatility. Moreover, structural estimation indicates that neglecting imperfect memory critically underestimates the informational challenges forecasters encounter.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/06/macroeconomic-expectations-and-cognitive-noise,2024-19,6/21/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,6/22/2024
Has the Transmission of US Monetary Policy Changed Since 2022?,Philip Barrett ; Josef Platzer,"Activity and inflation responded slowly to the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes in 2022. Was this because the transmission of monetary policy had changed? Or did other shocks offset tighter policy? We use pre-pandemic data to estimate a VAR with monetary policy shocks identified from high-frequency data, and use it as a filter to back out the sequence of monetary policy shocks consistent with data since 2022. We compare these implied shocks to the actual shocks and find the difference statistically significant during February-July 2022. These differences imply that monetary transmission was around 25 percent weaker than normal. Our method accounts for other shocks; allowing them to change to match the post-COVID covariance of the data produces similar results but in a shorter period. We decompose changes in the uncertainty of our estimate and find that colinearity of shocks is generally more important than uncertainty over model parameters. We extend our analysis to central bank information shocks and find Federal Reserve communication was less powerful than usual during 2021.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/21/Has-the-Transmission-of-US-Monetary-Policy-Changed-Since-2022-550898,2024-129,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/22/2024
Escaping the Financial Dollarization Trap: The Role of Foreign Exchange Intervention,Paul Castillo ; Ruy Lama ; Juan Pablo Medina,"Financial dollarization is considered a source of macroeconomic instability in many emerging economies. Dollarization constrains the ability of central banks to stimulate output during economic downturns. In contrast to the conventional monetary transmission mechanism, a monetary policy loosening in a dollarized economy leads to a currency depreciation, adverse balance sheet effects, and a contraction in investment and output growth. In this paper we evaluate the role of foreign exchange reserves in facilitating macroeconomic stabilization in a financially dollarized economy. We first show empirically that foreign exchange intervention in response to capital outflows can largely reduce the volatility of output and the real exchange rate in dollarized economies. We then develop a small open economy model with foreign currency debt and balance sheets effects. Our quantitative model shows that an active foreign exchange intervention policy is sufficient for offsetting the output volatility associated with financial dollarization. These results can explain the prevalence of low macroeconomic volatility in some dollarized economies (Christiano et al., 2021) and they highlight the role of foreign exchange reserves in reducing the welfare costs of dollarization.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/21/Escaping-the-Financial-Dollarization-Trap-The-Role-of-Foreign-Exchange-Intervention-550885,2024-127,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/22/2024
Green Fiscal Rules? Challenges and Policy Alternatives,Francesca Caselli ; Andresa Lagerborg ; Paulo A Medas,"This paper studies the impact of green fiscal rules – designed to protect climate-related spending –on debt dynamics. Simulations of green rules that exempt green spending from the rule limits for an emergingmarket economy illustrate that they can lead to unsustainable debt dynamics when the net zero emissions goal is pursued mostly using spending-based instruments (e.g., investment and subsidies). Or the rule would need to implicitly assume a large fiscal adjustment in the non-green budget, which would undermine its credibility. It will be needed to build broad public consensus for a more comprehensive fiscal strategy that tackles the difficult policy tradeoffs that will be required and takes into account long-term effects. A more appropriate mix of climate policies, including actively employing carbon pricing, should be pursued within the overall setting of fiscal and debt objectives. Developing ‘green’ medium-term fiscal frameworks would help to integrate climate change considerations into fiscal policy design in a more comprehensive manner.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/21/Green-Fiscal-Rules-Challenges-and-Policy-Alternatives-550880,2024-125,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/22/2024
Drivers of Post-COVID Private Consumption in the U.S.,Mai Dao ; La-Bhus Fah Jirasavetakul ; Jing Zhou,"Private consumption in the U.S. has recovered swiftly from the pandemic trough and has been running above the pre-pandemic trend even as interest rates rose sharply. This paper examines the underlying drivers for this strong growth in consumption. Using both state- and household-level data, we find that excess savings from the pandemic, large increases in household wealth (especially housing), along with solid real income gains contributed to strengthening post-pandemic consumption. Compared with pre-COVID estimates, the marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth is substantially higher, which, together with large gains in housing prices, made the wealth effect a key driver for post-pandemic consumption growth.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/21/Drivers-of-Post-COVID-Private-Consumption-in-the-U-S-550895,2024-128,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/22/2024

"The Price of De-Risking Reshoring, Friend-Shoring, and Quality Downgrading",Diego A. Cerdeiro ; Parisa Kamali ; Siddharth Kothari ; Dirk V Muir,"This paper estimates the costs of ‘de-risking’ scenarios between China and OECD members at the aggregate and sectoral levels. Aggregate large-scale de-risking – reshoring by increasing reliance on domestic production and friend-shoring by reducing imports from specific foreign countries – is quantified with the IMF’s GIMF model, suggesting significant permanent effects on the global economy. Returning integration to 2000 levels translates into long-term global GDP losses of 4.5 percent under reshoring and as much as 1.8 percent under friend-shoring. Friend-shoring does not necessarily deliver a boon to third countries as trade diversion benefits might be largely offset by contractions in China and OECD members. Sectoral de-risking, where all trade between rivals is eliminated in specific products, is quantified through empirical estimation of the scope for quality downgrading. The results demonstrate the potential for significant losses in input quality should there be an escalation in export bans. Losses are asymmetric against China in the specific case of semiconductors but can be significant for both sides in other sectors—including in critical areas such as environmental goods.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/20/The-Price-of-De-Risking-Reshoring-Friend-Shoring-and-Quality-Downgrading-545774,2024-122,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/22/2024
A Conceptual Policy Framework for Leveraging Digitalization to Support Diversification in Sub-Saharan Africa,Mame Astou Diouf ; Leonardo Pio Perez ; Felix F. Simione ; Arina Viseth ; Jiaxiong Yao,"The need for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries to diversify their economies is more urgent than ever. However, despite its established economic benefits, several challenges have precluded diversification in SSA. Against this backdrop, interesting initiatives to further adopt digital technologies, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest that digitalization is a promising avenue to overcome barriers to diversification. Fast-paced advances in the diffusion of digital technologies and knowledge have the potential to transform SSA economies through several channels. By connecting people and facilitating the rapid diffusion of information, digitalization also promises to reshape the industrial structure of activities in new and unprecedented ways. Therefore, digitalization has the potential to promote diversification and growth in SSA by acting both as an enabler and driver of economic activities, helping support resilience. Yet, while the empirical literature on SSA suggests that digitalization can provide new opportunities for growth, employment, productivity, and inclusion, the impact on diversification has not been studied. This paper aims to fill this important gap in the literature.

Firms' Perceived Cost of Capital,Niels Joachim Gormsen & Kilian Huber,"We study hand-collected data on firms’ perceptions of their cost of capital. Firms with higher perceived cost of capital earn higher returns on invested capital and invest less, suggesting that the perceived cost of capital shapes long-run capital allocation. The perceived cost of capital is partially related to the true cost of capital, which is determined by risk premia and interest rates, but there are also large deviations between the perceived and true cost of capital. Only 20% of the variation in the perceived cost of capital is justified by variation in the true cost of capital. The remaining 80% reflects deviations that are consistent with managers making mistakes. These deviations lead to misallocation of capital that lowers long-run aggregate productivity by 5% in a benchmark model. Forcing all firms to apply the same cost of capital would improve the allocation of capital relative to current corporate practice. The deviations in the perceived cost of capital challenge standard models, in particular the production-based asset pricing paradigm, and lead us to reject the “Investment CAPM.” We describe actionable methods that allow firms to improve their perceptions and capital allocation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32611,32611,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
The Value of De Minimis Imports,Pablo D. Fajgelbaum & Amit Khandelwal,"Section 321 of the 1930 Trade Act allows up to $800 in imports per person per day to enter the US duty-free and with minimal customs requirements. Fueled by rising direct-to-consumer trade, these “de minimis” shipments have exploded yet are not recorded in Census trade data. Who benefits from this type of trade, and what are the policy implications? We analyze international shipment data, including de minimis shipments, from three global carriers and US Customs and Border Protection. Lower-income zip codes are more likely to import de minimis shipments, particularly from China, suggesting that the tariff and administrative fee incidence in direct-to-consumer trade is pro-poor. Theoretically, imposing tariffs above a threshold leads to terms-of-trade gains through bunching, even in a setting with complete pass-through to linear tariffs. Empirically, bunching pins down the demand elasticity for direct shipments. Eliminating §321 would reduce aggregate welfare by $11.8-$14.3 billion and disproportionately hurt lower-income and minority consumers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32607,32607,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024

The Power of Inclusive Labor Force Participation for Mitigating Population Aging: Closing Gaps at the Intersection Between Race/Ethnicity and Gender in the United States,"René Böheim, Thomas Horvath, Thomas Leoni & Martin Spielauer","We develop a dynamic microsimulation model to project the labor force and economic dependency ratios in the United States from 2022 to 2060, taking population projections and the large inequalities between population groups of different race/ethnicity and gender into account. We contrast policy scenarios and show the potential impact that closing the gaps in education, health, and participation rates between population subgroups can have on increasing the U.S. labor force. Our baseline projections indicate an increase of the labor force of about 27 million people by 2060, which is mainly caused by population growth. The downstream effects of removing disparities in population health and educational attainment on labor force participation can add about 10% (+2.6 million people) to our baseline projections. The potential effects of closing gaps between genders and between minority groups and the non-Hispanic White population, however, are much larger if we assume the equalization of participation rates for individuals with similar characteristics. Closing gender gaps within ethno-racial groups, for instance, can add 9.9 to 14.3 million people to the labor force. Overall, reducing disparities in labor force participation rates has the potential to more than compensate the effects of demographic aging on the economic dependency ratio.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32590,32590,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Who Pays for Rising Health Care Prices? Evidence from Hospital Mergers,"Zarek Brot-Goldberg, Zack Cooper, Stuart V. Craig, Lev R. Klarnet, Ithai Lurie & Corbin L. Miller","We analyze the economic consequences of rising health care prices in the US. Using exposure to price increases caused by horizontal hospital mergers as an instrument, we show that rising prices raise the cost of labor by increasing employer-sponsored health insurance premiums. A 1% increase in health care prices lowers both payroll and employment at firms outside the health sector by approximately 0.4%. At the county level, a 1% increase in health care prices reduces per capita labor income by 0.27%, increases flows into unemployment by approximately 0.1 percentage points (1%), lowers federal income tax receipts by 0.4%, and increases unemployment insurance payments by 2.5%. The increases in unemployment we observe are concentrated among workers earning between $20,000 and $100,000 annually. Finally, we estimate that a 1% increase in health care prices leads to a 1 per 100,000 population (2.7%) increase in deaths from suicides and overdoses. This implies that approximately 1 in 140 of the individuals who become fully separated from the labor market after health care prices increase die from a suicide or drug overdose.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32613,32613,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Sovereign Haircuts: 200 Years of Creditor Losses,"Clemens M. Graf von Luckner, Josefin Meyer, Carmen M. Reinhart & Christoph Trebesch","We study sovereign external debt crises over the past 200 years, with a focus on creditor losses, or “haircuts”. Our sample covers 327 sovereign debt restructurings with external private creditors over 205 default spells since 1815. Creditor losses vary widely (from none to 100%), but the statistical distribution has remained remarkably stable over two centuries, with an average haircut of around 45 percent. The data also reveal that “serial restructurings”, meaning two or more debt exchanges in the same default spell, are on the rise. To account for this trend toward serial renegotiation, we introduce the “Bulow-Rogoff haircut” - a cumulative measure that captures the combined creditor loss across all restructurings during a single debt crisis. Using this measure, we show that longer debt crises deliver larger haircuts and that interim restructurings provide limited debt relief. We further examine past predictors of the size of haircuts and identify “rules of thumb” applicable to future defaults. Poorer countries, first-time debt issuers, and those that borrowed heavily from external creditors all record significantly higher haircuts in case of a default. Geopolitical shocks - such as wars, revolutions, or the break-up of empires – deliver the deepest haircuts. Sovereign debt investment disasters are often linked to (geo-)political disasters.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32599,32599,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
"Classical Right, New Right, and Voting Behavior: Evidence from a Quasi-Natural Experiment",Jesús Fernández-Villaverde & Carlos Sanz,"Due to a last-minute fight among the candidates, Vox, a party at the right end of the Spanish political spectrum, could not run in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, a relatively representative electoral constituency, in the general election of July 23, 2023. Since this fight was a power struggle within Vox unrelated to any fundamental in the constituency or ideological differences among the candidates, we can exploit this event as a quasi-natural experiment to measure the effects of new parties on electoral outcomes. Using three different but complementary research designs (matching, synthetic controls, and a triple-difference analysis), we get to the same main result: Vox's presence significantly increases votes for the right as a whole. The increase in votes for the right caused by Vox's presence is particularly strong in areas with high unemployment.

Agorastos","We construct the first consistent market rent and home sales price series for American cities across the 20th century using millions of newspaper real estate listings. Our findings revise several stylized facts about U.S. housing markets. Real market rents did not fall during the 20th century for most cities. Instead, real rental price levels increased by about 20% from 1890 to 2006. There was also greater growth in real housing sales prices from 1965 to 1995 than is commonly understood. Using these series we document several new facts about housing markets. The return to homeownership has varied considerably across cities and over time, but rental returns were historically much more important than capital gains in every city. We discuss the implications of our indices for the business cycle and the consumer price index. Finally, we provide evidence that housing prices increased unevenly across cities over time in response to natural building and regulatory constraints.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32593,32593,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Third Places and Neighborhood Entrepreneurship: Evidence from Starbucks Cafés,"Jinkyong Choi, Jorge Guzman & Mario L. Small","Sociologists have shown that “third places” such as neighborhood cafés help people maintain and use their network ties. Do they help local entrepreneurs, for whom networks are important? We examine whether the introduction of Starbucks cafés into U.S. neighborhoods with no coffee shops increased entrepreneurship. We find that, when compared to census tracts that were scheduled to receive a Starbucks but did not do so, tracts that received a Starbucks saw an increase in the number of startups of 5.0% to 11.8% (or 1.1 to 3.5 firms) per year, over the subsequent 7 years. There was no effect on neighborhoods with prior cafés. A partnership between Starbucks and Magic Johnson focused on underprivileged neighborhoods produced larger effects. Starbucks locations with more square footage and those with a higher number of visits also produced larger effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32604,32604,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
The Macroeconomics of Narratives,Joel P. Flynn & Karthik Sastry,"We study the macroeconomic implications of narratives, defined as beliefs about the economy that spread contagiously. In an otherwise standard business-cycle model, narratives generate persistent and belief-driven fluctuations. Sufficiently contagious narratives can ""go viral,"" generating hysteresis in the model's unique equilibrium. Empirically, we use natural-language-processing methods to measure firms' narratives. Consistent with the theory, narratives spread contagiously and firms expand after adopting optimistic narratives, even though these narratives have no predictive power for future firm fundamentals. Quantitatively, narratives explain 32% and 18% of the output reductions over the early 2000s recession and Great Recession, respectively, and 19% of output variance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32602,32602,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Charity: Have the Rates of US Households Contributing Money or Time Declined?,V. Kerry Smith,"This paper uses the responses to questions about charitable contributions from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) between 1992 and 2022 to consider the rates of US households contributing money or time to charitable organizations. The fraction donating $500 or more remained relatively constant over this period, with about 47% answering they had donated in both 1991 and 2021. The fraction of households volunteering time declined consistently after 2005 from 34% to 26%. When the samples are restricted to those giving financially or those volunteering, the results confirm the relationship between giving time or money depends on people’s other charitable behaviors.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32592,32592,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Is Software Eating the World?,Sangmin Aum & Yongseok Shin,"When explaining the declining labor income share in advanced economies, the macro literature finds that the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is greater than one. However, the vast majority of micro-level estimates shows that capital and labor are complements (elasticity less than one). Using firm- and establishment-level data from Korea, we divide capital into equipment and software, as they may interact with labor in different ways. Our estimation shows that equipment and labor are complements (elasticity 0.6), consistent with other micro-level estimates, but software and labor are substitutes (1.6), a novel finding that helps reconcile the macro vs. micro-literature elasticity discord. As the quality of software improves, labor shares fall within firms because of factor substitution and endogenously rising markups. In addition, production reallocates toward firms that use software more intensively, as they become effectively more productive. Because in the data these firms have higher markups and lower labor shares, the reallocation further raises the aggregate markup and reduces the aggregate labor share. The rise of software accounts for two-thirds of the labor share decline in Korea between 1990 and 2018. The factor substitution and the markup channels are equally important. On the other hand, the falling equipment price plays a minor role, because the factor substitution and the markup channels offset each other.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32591,32591,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
SAFE to update inflation expectations? New survey evidence on euro area firms,"Ursel Baumann, Annalisa Ferrando, Dimitris Georgarakos, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Timo Reinelt","This paper provides new survey evidence on firms’ inflation expectations in the euro area. Building on the ECB’s Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE), we introduce consistent measurement of inflation expectations across countries and shed new light on the properties and causal effects of these expectations. We find considerable heterogeneity in firms’ inflation expectations and show that firms disagree about future inflation more than professional forecasters but less than households. We document that differences in firms’ demographics, firms’ choices and constraints, and cross-country macroeconomic environments account for most of the variation in inflation expectations by roughly equal shares. Using an RCT approach, we show that firms update their inflation expectations in a Bayesian manner. Moreover, they revise their plans regarding prices, wages, costs and employment in response to information treatments about current or future inflation.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp28xx~5c9e8dc91b.en.pdf?a29ad10c25211ae0dbf091761c0cb23d,2949,24-Jun-24,ECB,6/24/2024
The Social Costs of Sovereign Default,"Juan P. Farah-Yacoub, Clemens M. Graf von Luckner & Carmen M. Reinhart","This paper investigates the economic and social consequences of sovereign default on external debt. We focus on the crises’ impact on real per capita GDP, infant mortality, life expectancy, poverty headcounts, and calorie supply per capita. After methodological exclusions, the sample covers 221 default episodes over 1815-2020. The analysis adopts an eclectic empirical strategy that relies on an augmented synthetic control method and local projections. Our findings suggest that sovereign defaults lead to significant adverse economic outcomes, with defaulting economies falling behind their counterparts by a cumulative 8.5 percent of GDP per capita within three years of default. Moreover, output per capita remains nearly 20 percent below that of non-defaulting peers after a decade. Based on the trajectory of the health, nutrition, and poverty indicators we study, we assess that the social costs of sovereign default are significant, broad-based, and long-lived.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32600,32600,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Diffuse Bunching with Frictions: Theory and Estimation,"Santosh Anagol, Allan Davids, Benjamin B. Lockwood & Tarun Ramadorai","We incorporate a general model of frictions into the bunching-based elasticity estimator. This model relies on fewer parameters than the conventional approach, replacing bunching window bounds with a single “lumpiness parameter,” while matching rich observed bunching patterns such as sharp-peaked diffusion around tax kinks and depressed density in the dominated region above a notch. Simulations suggest that in the presence of frictions, conventional methods may underestimate elasticities with overstated confidence. Our method draws information from the spread of bunching mass around kinks and asymmetry around notches, revealing the size of frictions, unobserved costs, and kink vs. notch misperceptions. Estimating this model on South African administrative tax data, we find that individuals and firms appear to treat the bottom zero-to-positive tax kink like a notch, and we uncover differences in lumpiness between wage earners vs. the self-employed and between firms with vs. without paid tax practitioners.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32597,32597,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Inflation Targets: Practice Ahead of Theory,Mervyn A. King,Inflation targets were introduced well ahead of the development of the theory of inflation targeting. The practice was successful because it comprised a new set of procedures and institutions for setting monetary policy in a transparent and accountable fashion – “constrained discretion”; the later theory was less useful because it purported to be a theory of the determination of the price level.  But inflation targeting does not constitute a new theory of the monetary transmission mechanism. The belief that it does led to the replacement of Milton Friedman’s dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” by the new dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere a transitory phenomenon”. This had unfortunate consequences during the recent inflation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges facing inflation targets in the future.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w32594,32594,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Voting on Public Goods: Citizens vs. Shareholders,"Robin J. Döttling, Doron Y. Levit, Nadya Malenko & Magdalena A. Rola-Janicka","We study the interplay between a ""one person-one vote"" political system and a ""one share-one vote"" corporate governance regime. The political system sets Pigouvian subsidies, while corporate governance determines firm-specific public good investments. Our analysis highlights a two-way feedback effect. In a frictionless economy, shareholder democracy is irrelevant: the political system fully offsets any effects of shareholder influence. With frictions in public policy provision, pro-social corporations fill the void of a dysfunctional regulatory system and increase the provision of public goods-demonstrating the benefit of shareholder democracy. Nevertheless, shareholder democracy can hurt a typical citizen because of the representation problem: it favors the preferences of the wealthy. If shareholders have extreme views, there can be a backlash against ESG initiatives, and the political system may undo or tax corporate social responsibility measures. Advancements in financial technologies that increase investor diversification or enable pass-through voting have important implications for these trade-offs of shareholder democracy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32605,32605,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Disaster Management,John Van Reenen & Agnes Norris Keiller,"Climate change is making natural disasters more frequent, yet little is known about the capacity of firms to withstand such disasters and adapt to their increased frequency. We examine this issue using a the latest wave of the World Management Survey (WMS) that includes new questions on firms’ climate change perceptions and adaptation behavior. Combining this with geocoded data on natural disasters and previous WMS waves, we create a panel spanning 8,000 firms across 33 countries and three decades that shows exposure to disasters decreases growth inputs, outputs and firm survival. More importantly, firms with structured management practices are more resilient, suffering much smaller drops in jobs and capital. To understand the mechanisms behind this resilience, we use the new WMS climate questions to show better managed firms have more accurate perceptions of climate-related risks to their businesses. Such firms are also more likely to have implemented measures to adapt to climate change both overall and in response to their perceived climate risk. Other aspects of firm organisation, such as decentralisation, also help protect against disasters, but their adaptation behaviour is not well-targeted. These results show that improving management is one way to help protect economies from climate change shocks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32595,32595,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Paying Your Fair Share: Perceived Fairness and Tax Compliance,"Brad C. Nathan, Ricardo Perez-Truglia & Alejandro Zentner","We provide evidence on the role of fairness for tax compliance: households are willing to pay more in taxes if they believe that other households are contributing their fair share. We conducted an information-disclosure natural field experiment in the context of property taxes in the United States. We induced exogenous shocks to households' perceptions about the average tax rate paid by other households. We find that a higher perceived average tax rate decreases the probability of filing a tax appeal. Translating our estimates into a money metric, we find that for each additional $1 contributed by the average household, a taxpayer is willing to pay an extra $0.43 in his or her own taxes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32588,32588,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024

Using administrative data and a difference-in-differences design, we find that test score gaps between high- and low-income students expanded on the high-stakes exam, consistent with wealthy students engaging in test prep. Yet the increase in stakes made scores more informative for students' college outcomes. Thus the ""muddling"" of information on natural ability and test prep improved the quality of the score signal, although it also exacerbated inequality.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32608,32608,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Williamson and Coase: Transaction Costs or Rent-Seeking in the Formation of Institutions,Gary D. Libecap,"The governance and transaction cost insights of Oliver Williamson (1975, 1985, 1996, 2010) and Ronald Coase (1937, 1992) have framed antitrust polices and firm management strategies. Transaction cost economics explain efficient governance adaptation. With a focus on private efficiency gains within firms and markets, however, neither Williamson nor Coase explore political exchange and rent-seeking. Coase (1960) sought to reform Pigouvian externality regulation based on transaction cost efficiencies. He called for assignment of property rights and bargaining, and for institutional comparisons of costs and benefits to reveal relative transaction cost and welfare advantages.  His 1960 paper is among the most cited in economics, but his remedies have not been adopted as the primary approach in major US environmental policies. All US environmental and natural resource laws since 1970 are Pigouvian. Limited Coasean bargaining occurs late and around the edges of the laws.  The efficiency advantages, welfare gains, and collaborative responses Coase suggested have not been achieved. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Act of 1976, enacted 16 years after Coase, used Pigouvian fishery regulation for 25 years, and upon failure, was replaced by abbreviated property rights and trade. Fishery economic values were lowered relative to what might have been possible. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 rejected previous Coasean legislation authorizing purchase of critical habitat and instead opted for uncompensated Pigouvian controls on private landowners, who held most endangered species. Landowners resisted, and only 3% of listed endangered species have recovered. There is no evidence of a weighing of comparative transaction costs between Coase or Pigou in enacting any legislation.  Rent-seeking via political bargaining among interest groups, politicians, and agency officials explains many of the observed patterns in externality regulation.  The analysis suggests that transaction cost economics play a lesser role in the political arena.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32603,32603,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Evaluating Pharmaceutical Policy Options,Kate Ho & Ariel Pakes,"Our calculations indicate that currently proposed U.S. policies to reduce pharmaceutical prices, though particularly beneficial for low-income and elderly populations, could dramatically reduce firms’ investment in highly welfare-improving R&D. The U.S. subsidizes the worldwide pharmaceutical market. One reason is U.S. prices are higher than elsewhere. If each drug had a single international price across the highest-income OECD countries, and total pharmaceutical firm profits were held fixed, then U.S. prices would fall by half and every other country’s prices would increase (by 28 to 300%). International prices would maintain firms’ R&D incentives and more equitably share the costs of pharmaceutical research.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32606,32606,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
One Cohort at a Time: A New Perspective on the Declining Gender Pay Gap,"Jaime Arellano-Bover, Nicola Bianchi, Salvatore Lattanzio & Matteo Paradisi","This paper studies the interaction between the decrease in the gender pay gap and the stagnation in the careers of younger workers, analyzing data from the United States, Italy, Canada, and the United Kingdom. We propose a model of the labor market in which a larger supply of older workers can crowd out younger workers from top-paying positions. These negative career spillovers disproportionately affect the career trajectories of younger men because they are more likely than younger women to hold higher-paying jobs at baseline. The data strongly support this cohort-driven interpretation of the shrinking gender pay gap. The whole decline in the gap originates from (i) newer worker cohorts who enter the labor market with smaller-than-average gender pay gaps and (ii) older worker cohorts who exit with higher-than-average gender pay gaps. As predicted by the model, the gender pay convergence at labor-market entry stems from younger men's larger positional losses in the wage distribution. Younger men experience the largest positional losses within higher-paying firms, in which they become less represented over time at a faster rate than younger women. Finally, we document that labor-market exit is the sole contributor to the decline in the gender pay gap after the mid-1990s, which implies no full gender pay convergence for the foreseeable future. Consistent with our framework, we find evidence that most of the remaining gender pay gap at entry depends on predetermined educational choices.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32612,32612,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
Dynamic Identification in VARs,"Paul Beaudry, Fabrice Collard, Patrick Fève, Alain Guay & Franck Portier","Most macroeconomic models view economic outcomes as being generated by a combination of endogenous and exogenous dynamic forces. In particular, the exogenous forces are generally modelled as a set of independent dynamics processes. In this paper we begin by showing that this dual dynamic structure is sufficient to identify the entire set of structural impulse responses inherent to any such model. No extra restrictions are needed. We then use this result to suggest how it can be used to evaluate common SVAR restrictions (impact restrictions, long run restrictions and proxy-VAR).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32598,32598,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
"Destabilizing Digital ""Bank Walks""","Naz Koont, Tano Santos & Luigi Zingales","We study the impact of digital banking on the value of the deposit franchise and the stability of the banking sector. Using the classification of digital banking in Koont (2023), we find that when the Fed funds rate increases, deposits flow out faster, and the cost of deposits increases more in banks that offer a mobile app and brokerage services. Using the model of Drechsler et al. (2023b), we find that correcting for digital betas and deposit outflows results in a deposit franchise value that is 14-22% lower for digital-broker banks relative to traditional banks. Moreover, we find that digital-broker banks’ deposit franchise values increase by less when interest rates rise, serving as less of a hedge. We apply this analysis to the case of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and find that the reduced value of the deposit franchise can explain why SVB was insolvent in early March 2023, even before the bank run occurred.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32601,32601,24-Jun,NBER,6/24/2024
"Inflation, Price Dispersion, and Welfare: The Role of Consumer Search",Francisca Sara-Zaror,"In standard macroeconomic models, the costs of inflation are tightly linked to the price dispersion of identical goods. Therefore, understanding how price dispersion empirically relates to inflation is crucial for welfare analysis. In this paper, I study the relationship between steady-state inflation and price dispersion for a cross section of U.S. retail products using scanner data. By comparing prices of items with the same barcode, my measure of relative price dispersion controls for product heterogeneity, overcoming an important challenge in the literature. I document a new fact: price dispersion of identical goods increases steeply around zero inflation and becomes flatter as inflation increases, displaying a Y-shaped pattern. Current sticky-price models are inconsistent with this finding. I develop a menu-cost model with idiosyncratic productivity shocks and sequential consumer search that reproduces the new fact and exhibits realistic price-setting behavior. In the model, inflation-induced price dispersion increases shoppers' incentives to search for low prices and thus competition among retailers. The positive welfare-maximizing inflation rate optimally trades off the efficiency gains from lower markups and the resources spent on search.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/inflation-price-dispersion-and-welfare-the-role-of-consumer-search.htm,2024-047,24-Jun,FED-BOARD,6/25/2024

We document that people who are lesbian, gay, and bisexual (or LGB) have significantly more difficulty managing financially than similarly situated heterosexual individuals—and this pre-dated the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences are found across a broad array of current and future financial well-being outcomes, including retirement savings, rainy-day funds, credit card and schooling debts, and the use of alternative financial services such as payday loans. Differences in partnership, financial assistance from parents, financial knowledge, and risk preferences cannot explain these differences. Instead, we document that some social vulnerabilities such as exposure to discriminatory behavior and violence are differentially experienced by LGB people, which may play a role.

On Commercial Construction Activity's Long and Variable Lags,"David Glancy, Robert Kurtzman, Lara Loewenstein","We use microdata on the phases of commercial construction projects to document three facts regarding time-to-plan lags: (1) plan times are long—about 1.5 years—and highly variable, (2) roughly 40 percent of projects are abandoned in planning, and (3) property price appreciation reduces the likelihood of abandonment. We construct a model with endogenous planning starts and abandonment that matches these facts.

Firms’ Response to Climate Regulations-Empirical Investigations Based on the European Emissions Trading System,Fotios Kalantzis ; Salma Khalid ; Alexandra Solovyeva ; Marcin Wolski,"Using a novel cross-country dataset, which merges firm-level financials with information on firms’ participation in the European Unions’ Emissions Trading System (ETS), we investigate how firm performance is affected by tightening of environmental policies that put a price on pollution. We find that more stringent policies do not have a strong negative impact on the profitability of ETS-regulated or non-ETS firms. While firms report an increase in their input costs during periods of high carbon prices, their reported turnover is also higher. Among ETS-regulated firms which must purchase emission certificates under the EU ETS, tightening of climate policies in periods of high carbon prices results in increased investment, particularly in intangible assets. We establish robustness of our results using a quantile regression analysis, ensuring our key findings are not driven by distributional irregularities.

Promise (Un)kept? Fintech and Financial Inclusion,Serhan Cevik,"The emergence of financial technologies—fintech—has become an engine of change, promising to expand access to financial services and give a boost to financial inclusion. The ownership of accounts in formal financial institutions increased from 51 percent of the world’s adult population in 2011 to 76 percent in 2021, but there is still significant variation across countries. So has the rapid growth of fintech delivered the promise of broadening financial services to the under-served populations? In this paper, I use a comprehensive dataset to investigate the relationship between fintech and financial inclusion in a panel of 84 countries over the period 2012–2020 and obtain interesting empirical insights. First, the magnitude and statistical significance of fintech on financial inclusion varies according to the type of instrument. While digital lending has a significant negative effect on financial inclusion, digital capital raising is statistically insignificant. Second, the overall impact of fintech is also statistically insignificant for the full sample, but becomes positive and statistically highly significant in developing countries. Policymakers need to develop an adequate regulatory framework that balances fostering innovation and ensuring equitable treatment of individuals and groups.

Crypto as a Marketplace for Capital Flight,Clemens M. Graf von Luckner ; Robin Koepke ; Silvia Sgherri,"This paper shows how cryptocurrency markets can fuel cross-border capital flight by serving as marketplaces that match counterparts with and without (illicit) access to FX. In countries where international transactions are restricted, crypto exchanges effectively allow domestic agents to pay a premium to buy foreign currency. The counterparts to these transactions are agents with access to FX, who sell crypto holdings purchased abroad. A stylized model illustrates that restricted foreign currency amid economic imbalances incentivizes these transactions via persistent crypto premia in local relative to global markets. We analyze relative crypto pricing data in several country case studies, providing empirical support that crypto markets serve as marketplaces for capital flight that already took place, rather than a novel channel for capital flight. We make available a novel dataset on crypto market premia, which we propose as indicators of excess demand for foreign currency and capital control intensity. The dataset will be posted along with this paper and updated periodically.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/28/Crypto-as-a-Marketplace-for-Capital-Flight-550966,2024-133,"Fri, 28 Jun 2024 ",IMF,6/29/2024
The Catalytic Impact of IMF Lending on Official Development Assistance,Bangyu He ; Phil Johnston ; Agustin Velasquez,"This paper explores the catalytic impact of IMF lending to Low-Income Countries on Official Development Assistance (ODA) during 1990-2019. It disentangles the effect on the amounts of ODA on countries’ participation in IMF programs (“extensive margin”) and the size of the IMF-supported program (“intensive margin”). To address selection biases, we rely on the interaction of past IMF program participation and IMF liquidity as an instrument for program participation and employ the review of access limits as an instrument for the size of disbursements. We document that a one percentage point (pp) of GDP increase in IMF disbursements catalyzes additional ODA of 2.7 pp of GDP. In addition, we find that IMF disbursements catalyze ODA mostly from multilateral donors (1.3 pp of GDP) and to lesser extent from traditional bilateral donors (0.6 pp of GDP). Among multilateral donors, the strongest effect is on World Bank disbursements, followed by the EU.

Evidence from State Flagship College Towns,Robert  Calvert  Jump  and  Adam Scavette,"Using synthetic differences-in-differences models, we study whether U.S. counties containing state flagship universities experienced resiliency via lower unemployment rates during the past three U.S. recessions. We find an insignificant effect for the 2001 recession and a large resiliency effect for the 2008-2009 recession. However, counties with flagship universities faced higher unemployment rates during the 2020 recession, and were therefore less resilient to the Covid-19 recession than other counties. These results support the hypothesis that stable consumption demand for non-tradables drives resiliency, which was absent during the 2020 recession when most university campuses were closed to students due to Covid-19 restrictions.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2024/wp_24-05,24-05,24-Jun,FED-RICHMOND,6/29/2024
How Inflation Expectations De-Anchor: The Role of Selective Memory Cues,"Nicola Gennaioli, Marta Leva, Raphael Schoenle & Andrei Shleifer","In a model of memory and selective recall, household inflation expectations remain rigid when inflation is anchored but exhibit sharp instability during inflation surges, as similarity prompts retrieval of forgotten high-inflation experiences. Using data from the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations and the University of Michigan’s Consumer Survey, we show that similarity can quantitatively account for the sharp post-pandemic rise in inflation expectations, particularly among the elderly. The memory-based model also accounts for how people estimate future inflation ranges and why they neglect infrequent experiences when forming point expectations. These predictions are likewise supported by the data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32633,32633,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Social Comparisons and Adolescent Body Misperception: Evidence from School Entry Cutoffs,Christopher S. Carpenter & Brandyn F. Churchill,"We provide novel evidence on the role of social comparisons in shaping adolescent body misperception. Using an instrumental variables approach leveraging variation in relative age generated by school entry cutoff months and data from the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children study, we show that relatively older students are more likely to misperceive their weight harshly relative to their BMIs compared to their same-age counterparts who are relatively younger within their classrooms. Meanwhile, relatively younger students are more likely to misperceive their weight leniently relative to their BMIs. We then show that relatively older students are less likely to be overweight or obese, consume more low-calorie foods, and report higher levels of physical activity. Overall, our results suggest that relatively older students base their weight-related expectations and behaviors on their younger peers, while relatively younger students compare themselves to their older peers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32629,32629,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Leaders in Social Movements: Evidence From Unions in Myanmar,"Laura E. Boudreau, Rocco Macchiavello, Virginia Minni & Mari Tanaka","Social movements are catalysts for crucial institutional changes. To succeed, they must coordinate members’ views (consensus building) and actions (mobilization). We study union leaders within Myanmar’s burgeoning labor movement. Union leaders are positively selected on both personality traits that enable them to influence others and ability but earn lower wages. In group discussions about workers’ views on an upcoming national minimum wage negotiation, randomly embedded leaders build consensus around the union’s preferred policy. In an experiment that mimics individual decision-making in a collective action set-up, leaders increase mobilization through coordination. Leaders empower social movements by building consensus that encourages mobilization.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32619,32619,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Breaking Boundaries: Lower Tail Dependence Can Triple the Economic Value of Index Insurance for Rural Households,"Enrique Estefania-Salazar, Michael Carter, Eva Iglesias & Álvaro Escribano","Despite its promise to help low-wealth households manage climate risk, index insurance remains hampered by downside basis risk, meaning that an insured party suffers a loss, but receives no payment because the insurance index fails to register a loss. While efforts to reduce basis risk focus on the creation of indices that better predict losses, this paper focuses on the creation of statistically rigorous insurance zones that minimize downside basis risk. In contrast to our approach, most existing index insurance contracts use statistically ad hoc administrative boundaries to demarcate insurance zones. To improve on this practice, we develop a machine learning algorithm that forms zones to maximizes lower tail dependence within the zone. After exploring the logic for using lower tail dependence, we apply our algorithm to the long-running index-based livestock insurance contract in Northern Kenya. We show that compared to the currently employed administrative insurance areas, our algorithm creates an insurance contract that increases the expected utility value of the insurance by 60-200% even when keeping the number of zones the same. Optimizing the number of zones using our method can further increase the economic value of index insurance to its beneficiaries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32618,32618,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
How Merger Synergies Can Harm Consumers: A Defense of the Efficiencies Offense,Paulo Ramos & Thomas G. Wollmann,"This paper uses an aggregative games framework to predict consumer welfare when market structure is endogenously determined. Our main results characterize mergers whose synergies reduce consumer welfare by inducing rivals to exit. The conditions under which such mergers arise are broad, regardless of whether we consider quantity competition among homogeneous products or price competition among multi-product firms facing multinomial logit demand. Calibrated models based on commonly used parameter values indicate that the synergies required to avoid consumer harm can be much higher than those implied by traditional merger analysis. Neither subsequent entry nor follow-on mergers necessarily mitigate the problem.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32630,32630,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
How Are Insurance Markets Adapting to Climate Change? Risk Selection and Regulation in the Market for Homeowners Insurance,"Judson Boomhower, Meredith Fowlie, Jacob Gellman & Andrew Plantinga","As climate risk escalates, property insurance is critical to reduce the risk exposure of households and firms and to aid recovery when disasters strike. To perform these functions efficiently, insurers need to access high quality information about disaster risk and set prices that accurately reflect the costs of insuring this risk. We use proprietary data on parcel-level wildfire risk, together with insurance premiums derived from insurers' regulatory filings, to investigate how insurance is priced and provided in a large market for homeowners insurance. We document striking variation in insurers' risk pricing strategies. Firms that rely on coarser measures of wildfire risk charge relatively high prices in high-risk market segments -- or choose not to serve these areas at all. Empirical results are consistent with a winner's curse, where firms with less granular pricing strategies face higher expected losses. A theoretical model of a market for natural hazard insurance that incorporates both price regulation and asymmetric information across insurers helps rationalize the empirical patterns we document. Our results highlight the underappreciated importance of the winner's curse as a driver of high prices and limited participation in insurance markets for large, hard-to-model risks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32625,32625,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Are We Fragmented Yet? Measuring Geopolitical Fragmentation and Its Causal Effect,"Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Tomohide Mineyama & Dongho Song","After decades of rising global economic integration, the world economy is now fragmenting. To measure this phenomenon, we introduce an index of geopolitical fragmentation derived from various empirical indicators. This index is developed using a flexible dynamic factor model with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility. We then employ structural vector autoregressions and local projections to assess the causal effects of changes in fragmentation. Our analysis demonstrates that increased fragmentation negatively impacts the global economy, with emerging economies suffering more than advanced ones. Notably, we document a key asymmetry: fragmentation has an immediate negative effect, while the benefits of reduced fragmentation unfold gradually. A sectoral analysis within OECD economies reveals that industries closely linked to global markets—such as manufacturing, construction, finance, and wholesale and retail trade—are adversely affected. Finally, we examine the interaction between fragmentation and the economic dynamics of regional economic blocs, highlighting significant differences in the impacts across various geopolitical blocs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32638,32638,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Retirement Benefit Distributions for California Educators,"Robert L. Clark, Denis Pelletier & Beth Ritter","Distribution choices by individuals retiring from CalSTRS are examined for participants that retired between 2016 and 2023. Women are much more likely to select a member-only annuity while a larger proportion of men select a J&S annuity that provide survivor benefits. Being married is a dominant factor in the selection of J&S annuities. Greater final annual salary, older ages at retirement, and more years of service are associated with a greater probability of choosing a J&S annuity. We also find that benefit choices from the primary benefit plan are jointly determined with distributions chosen from the supplemental pension plan. Interestingly, about half of retirees select a lump sum distribution from the supplemental plan while receiving an annuity from their primary plan.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32631,32631,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Household Climate Finance: Theory and Survey Data on Safe and Risky Green Assets,"Shifrah Aron-Dine, Johannes Beutel, Monika Piazzesi & Martin Schneider","This paper studies green investing in a quantitative asset pricing model with heterogeneous investors calibrated using high-quality, representative survey data of German households. We find substantial heterogeneity in green taste for both safe and risky green assets throughout the wealth distribution. Model counterfactuals show nonpecuniary benefits and hedging demands currently make green equity more expensive for firms. Yet, these taste effects are dominated by optimistic expectations about green equity returns, lowering firms' cost of green equity to a greenium of 1%. Looking ahead, we use our model to trace out the aggregate effects of information provision in an RCT and find green equity investment could potentially double when information about green finance spreads across the population.  Regarding safe green assets, our model counterfactuals show that if green deposits could be offered at a 50 basis point interest rate spread, aggregate green investments in the economy could quadruple in the medium run.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32615,32615,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Closing the Gates: Assessing Impacts of the Immigration Act of 1917,Ina Ganguli & Jennifer R. Withrow,"On February 5, 1917, the United States passed the Immigration Act of 1917, which included a test for all migrants arriving to the U.S. to prove they were literate. The Literacy Test was one of the first and few times the U.S. used a broad ‘skill-based’ immigration policy in an attempt to limit migration. We assess whether the Immigration Act had any measurable impacts on immigration to the U.S. Using a differences-in-differences approach and digitized data from Ellis Island ship manifests from directly before and after the Act’s passage and enactment, we show that the Act significantly altered selection into migration to the U.S. from Europe through Ellis Island, reducing migration from low literacy countries by 70 percent compared to arrivals from high-literacy countries. We also discuss other provisions of the Act that had the potential to influence the gender composition of arrivals. We show that women – and in particular single women – were less likely to arrive after its passage.  Our analysis suggests that even during this period of lower immigration due to WWI and rising literacy levels, the 1917 Act was a consequential moment in immigration history in the United States.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32624,32624,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
The Intergenerational Effects of Permanent Legal Status,"Elizabeth U. Cascio, Paul Cornell & Ethan G. Lewis","We estimate the effects of permanent legal status on the health of children born to immigrants in the United States using variation from the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA).  Our empirical approach compares trends in birth outcomes for foreign-born Mexican mothers across counties with different application rates under IRCA’s large-scale legalization programs. Maternal legalization raised birthweight.  Effects arose immediately after the application process began – five years before affected women became Medicaid-eligible – suggesting causal mechanisms besides improved access to early prenatal care.  Changes in the composition of births, stemming from changes in fertility and family reunification, contribute to but far from fully explain the birthweight impacts.  The more likely mechanisms were instead the increases in family income and reductions in stress that came from gaining legal status.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32635,32635,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Bond Market Views of the Fed,"Luigi Bocola, Alessandro Dovis, Kasper Jørgensen & Rishabh Kirpalani","This paper uses high frequency data to detect shifts in financial markets' perception of the Federal Reserve stance on inflation. We construct daily revisions to expectations of future nominal interest rates and inflation that are priced into nominal and inflation-protected bonds, and find that the relation between these two variables-positive and stable for over twenty years-has weakened substantially over the 2020-2022 period. In the context of canonical monetary reaction functions considered in the literature, these results are indicative of a monetary authority that places less weight on inflation stabilization. We augment a standard New Keynesian model with regime shifts in the monetary policy rule, calibrate it to match our findings, and use it as a laboratory to understand the drivers of U.S. inflation post 2020. We find that the shift in the monetary policy stance accounts for half of the observed increase in inflation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32620,32620,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Building a Wall Around Science: The Effect of U.S.-China Tensions on International Scientific Research,"Robert Flynn, Britta Glennon, Raviv Murciano-Goroff & Jiusi Xiao","This paper examines the impact of rising U.S.-China geopolitical tensions on three main dimensions of science: STEM trainee mobility between these countries, usage of scientific works between scientists in each country, and scientist productivity in each country. We examine each dimension from a “U.S.” perspective and from a “China” perspective in an effort to provide evidence around the asymmetric effects of isolationism and geopolitical tension on science. Using a differences-in-differences approach in tandem with CV and publication data, we find that between 2016 and 2019 ethnically Chinese graduate students became 16% less likely to attend a U.S.-based Ph.D. program, and that those that did became 4% less likely to stay in the U.S. after graduation. In both instances, these students became more likely to move to a non-U.S. anglophone country instead. Second, we document a sharp decline in Chinese usage of U.S. science as measured by citations, but no such decline in the propensity of U.S. scientists to cite Chinese research. Third, we find that while a decline in Chinese usage of U.S. science does not appear to affect the average productivity of China-based researchers as measured by publications, heightened anti-Chinese sentiment in the U.S. appears to reduce the productivity of ethnically Chinese scientists in the U.S. by 2-6%. Our results do not suggest any clear “winner,” but instead indicate that increasing isolationism and geopolitical tension lead to reduced talent and knowledge flows between the U.S. and China, which are likely to be particularly damaging to international science. The effects on productivity are still small but are likely to only grow as nationalistic and isolationist policies also escalate. The results as a whole strongly suggest the presence of a “chilling effect” for ethnically Chinese scholars in the U.S., affecting both the U.S.’s ability to attract and retain talent as well as the productivity of its ethnically Chinese scientists.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32622,32622,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Wealth at Birth and its Effect on Child Academic Achievement and Behavioral Problems,Luis F. Faundez & Robert Kaestner,"In this article, we examine the association between family wealth and academic achievement and socioemotional behaviors of children ages 5 to 12. We examine whether wealth prior to birth and at ages 4 or 5 affects academic test scores and behavioral problems during two periods of childhood, ages 5 to 8 and ages 9 to 12, for a large and relatively recent cohort of children. We also examine associations between different forms of wealth (e.g., home equity) and child achievement and behaviors. Finally, we assess whether wealth prior to birth mediates racial/ethnic disparities in child achievement and disparities in achievement by maternal education/ability (AFQT). Results of our analysis indicate that wealth, particularly financial wealth that is the most liquid, has a modest positive association with achievement test scores. We also find that wealth is associated with fewer behavioral problems, but these results are less robust.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32628,32628,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Price Discounts and Cheapflation During the Post-Pandemic Inflation Surge,Alberto Cavallo & Oleksiy Kryvtsov,"We study how within-store price variation changes with inflation, and whether households exploit it to attenuate the inflation burden. We use micro price data for food products sold by 91 large multi-channel retailers in ten countries between 2018 and 2024. Measuring unit prices within narrowly defined product categories, we analyze two key sources of variation in prices within a store: temporary price discounts and differences across similar products. Price changes associated with discounts grew at a much lower average rate than regular prices, helping to mitigate the inflation burden. By contrast, cheapflation—a faster rise in prices of cheaper goods relative to prices of more expensive varieties of the same good—exacerbated it. Using Canadian Homescan Panel Data, we estimate that spending on discounts reduced the change in the average unit price by 4.1 percentage points, but expenditure switching to cheaper brands raised it by 2.8 percentage points.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32626,32626,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
On the Ubiquity of Declining Business Dynamism,David Hummels & Kan Yue,"Recent work documents declining business dynamism in the United States, with concerning implications for markups, innovation and productivity. Using import data for 146 countries over three decades we document a set of new stylized facts describing market dynamism world-wide. Market entry rates and the reallocation of market shares fall significantly over time. Young exporters experience rising prices, falling market shares, and increased exit probabilities relative to longer-tenured incumbents. While the variance of price shocks hitting markets is rising, long-tenured incumbents exhibit lower volatility in prices and the response of prices and quantities to tariff shocks are falling over time. These patterns hold for over 90 percent of countries and products suggesting the inadequacy of explanations that point to the macroeconomic or regulatory environment of particular countries or the unique industrial organization of particular products.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32637,32637,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Beyond the War: Public Service and the Transmission of Gender Norms,"Abhay Aneja, Silvia Farina & Guo Xu","This paper combines personnel records of the U.S. federal government with census data to study how shocks to the gender composition of a large organization can persistently shift gender norms. Exploiting city-by-department variation in the sudden expansion of female clerical employment driven by World War I, we find that daughters of civil servants exposed to female co-workers are more likely to work later in life, command higher income, and have fewer children. These intergenerational effects increase with the size of the city-level exposure to female government workers and are driven by daughters in their teenage years at the time of exposure. We also show that cities exposed to a larger increase in female federal workers saw persistently higher female labor force participation in the public sector, as well as modest contemporaneous increases in private sector labor force participation suggestive of spill-overs. Collectively, the results are consistent with both the vertical and horizontal transmission of gender norms and highlight how increasing gender representation within the public sector can have broader labor market implications.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32639,32639,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Regime Changes and FDI: A Tale of Two Countries – Poland and Israel,Assaf Razin & Andrzej Cieslik,"This essay highlights the effects of radical transformations in the liberal characteristics of the regimes on foreign direct investors. To focus on the common patterns in the effects on foreign direct investment, of liberal vs. illiberal regime change, the essay spotlights the tale of two countries: Poland and Israel. The liberalization of the Polish economy and market reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s boosted Poland's attractiveness to international companies. However, decades-long of illiberal policies under the PiS regime has reduced Poland's appeal to foreign investors. Similarly, Israel's GNP especially the high-tech sector saw significant growth from the 1990s to the 2010s, driven by the liberalization of capital and finance surges, and the global IT boom immigration. As a more-or-less a laboratory experiment for the real-economy impact of an abrupt transition to an illiberal regime, early steps of a comprehensive judicial overhaul have disrupted Israel's growth, causing a sharp decline in foreign direct investment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32614,32614,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Reliability Options in Renewables-Dominated Electricity Markets,Shaun D. McRae & Frank A. Wolak,"Recent energy shortfalls in renewables-dominated electricity markets call for a mechanism to ensure demand is met under all system conditions. We demonstrate severe shortcomings of an increasingly popular mechanism—reliability options—caused by its interaction with fixed-price forward contracts for energy. Large generators can trigger the option exercise, weakening the short-term incentive to sell output provided by forward contracts alone. In the longer term, hydro generators sell more forward contracts and store less water, reducing system reliability. We empirically show that Colombian generators respond to these incentives. We analyze a standardized energy contracting approach to long-term resource adequacy that does not create these economic incentives.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32616,32616,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
The Long and Variable Lags of Monetary Policy: Evidence from Disaggregated Price Indices,S. Borağan Aruoba & Thomas Drechsel,"We study how monetary policy affects subcomponents of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCEPI) using local projections. Following a monetary policy contraction, the response of aggregate PCEPI turns significantly negative after over three years. There are stark differences in the timing and magnitude of the responses across price categories, including some prices that show an initially positive response. We discuss theoretical interpretations of our findings and point to useful directions for future theoretical research. We also show how to re-aggregate our cross-sectional estimates and their standard errors, taking into account dependence between different prices using a Seemingly Unrelated Regression approach. Re-aggregation exercises show that changes in expenditure behavior have not accelerated the long-lagged response of inflation to monetary policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32623,32623,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
How Good are Proxies for Legal Status? Evidence from the Legalization of Two Million Mexicans,"Elizabeth U. Cascio, Ethan G. Lewis & Chengguo Zhang","Two million Mexicans were granted lawful permanent residency in the U.S. under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). We find that occupation and program use variables in a prominent proxy for legal status poorly detect this event. A decade after legalization, the share of Mexicans who are likely legal according to these variables shows little absolute change in survey data, with estimates ruling out increases of three and eight percentage points relative to comparison groups of Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Blacks, respectively.

Identifying Agglomeration Shadows: Long-run Evidence from Ancient Ports,"Richard Hornbeck, Guy Michaels & Ferdinand Rauch","We examine “agglomeration shadows” that emerge around large cities, which discourage some economic activities in nearby areas.  Identifying agglomeration shadows is complicated, however, by endogenous city formation and “wave interference” that we show in simulations.  We use the locations of ancient ports near the Mediterranean, which seeded modern cities, to estimate agglomeration shadows cast on nearby areas.  We find that empirically, as in the simulations, detectable agglomeration shadows emerge for large cities around ancient ports.  These patterns extend to modern city locations more generally, and illustrate how encouraging growth in particular places can discourage growth of nearby areas.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32634,32634,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024

The Golden Revolving Door,"Ling Cen, Lauren Cohen, Jing Wu & Fan Zhang","Using both the onset of the US-China trade war in 2018 and the most recent Russia-Ukraine war and associated trade tensions, we show a counterintuitive pattern in global trade. Namely, while the average firm trading with these nations significantly decreases their trade with these jurisdictions following sanctions, government-linked firms show a marked contrast. In particular, government-linked firms actually significantly increase their trading activity following the onset of formal sanctions. The increase is large - roughly 33% (t=4.01). We find no increase broadly to other countries (even countries in the same regions) at the same time, nor of these same firms in these same regions at other times. In terms of mechanism, government-linked supplier firms are nearly twice as likely to receive tariff exemptions. More broadly, these effects are increasing in the level of government connection. For instance, firms geographically closer to the government agencies they supply increase their imports more acutely. Using micro-level data, government-supplying firms recruiting more employees with past government work experience also increase trading activity more – particularly when the past employee worked in a government-contracting role. Lastly, this results in sizable accrued benefits in terms of firm-level profitability, market share gains, and outsized stock returns.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32621,32621,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
The Economic Effects of American Slavery: Tests at the Border,Hoyt Bleakley & Paul Rhode,"To engage with the large literature on the economic effects of slavery, we use antebellum census data to test for statistical differences at the 1860 free-slave border. We find evidence of lower population density, less intensive land use, and lower farm values on the slave side. Half of the border region was half underutilized. This does not support the view that abolition was a costly constraint for landowners. Indeed, the lower demand for similar, yet cheaper, land presents a different puzzle: why wouldn't the yeomen farmers cross the border to fill up empty land in slave states, as was happening in the free states of the Old Northwest? On this point, we find evidence of higher wages on the slave side, indicating an aversion of free labor to working in a slave society. This evidence of systemically lower economic performance in slavery-legal areas suggests that the earlier literature on the profitability of plantations was misplaced, or at least incomplete.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32640,32640,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024
Monetary Policy without Moving Interest Rates: The Fed Non-Yield Shock,Christoph Boehm & T. Niklas Kroner,"Existing high-frequency monetary policy shocks explain surprisingly little variation in stock prices and exchange rates around FOMC announcements. Further, both of these asset classes display heightened volatility relative to non-announcement times. We use a heteroskedasticity-based procedure to estimate a “Fed non-yield shock”, which is orthogonal to yield changes and is identified from excess volatility in the S&P 500 and various dollar exchange rates. A positive non-yield shock raises stock prices in the U.S. and around the globe, and depreciates the dollar against all major currencies. The non-yield shock is essentially uncorrelated with previous monetary policy shocks and its effects are large in comparison. Its strong effects on the VIX and other risk-related measures point towards a dominant risk premium channel. We show that the non-yield shock can be related to Fed communications and that its existence has implications for the identification of structural monetary policy shocks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32636,32636,24-Jul,NBER,7/1/2024

Quantitative Easing and Inequality,Donggyu Lee,"This paper studies how quantitative easing (QE) affects household welfare across the wealth distribution. I build a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model with household portfolio choice, wage and price rigidities, endogenous unemployment, frictional financial intermediation, an effective lower bound (ELB) on the policy rate, forward guidance, and QE. To quantify the contribution of the various channels through which monetary policy affects inequality, I estimate the model using Bayesian methods, explicitly taking into account the occasionally binding ELB constraint and the QE operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve during the 2009-15 period. I find that the QE program unambiguously benefited all households by stimulating economic activity. However, it had nonlinear distributional effects. On the one hand, it widened the income and consumption gap between the top 10 percent and the rest of the wealth distribution by boosting profits and equity prices. On the other hand, QE shrank inequality within the lower 90 percent of the wealth distribution, primarily by lowering unemployment. On net, it reduced overall wealth and income inequality, as measured by the Gini index. Surprisingly, QE has weaker distributional consequences compared with conventional monetary policy. Lastly, forward guidance and an extended period of zero policy rates amplified both the aggregate and the distributional effects of QE.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1108,1108,7/1/2024,FED-NEWYORK,7/2/2024

The Lasting Impacts of Middle School Principals,"Eric A. Hanushek, Andrew J. Morgan, Steven G. Rivkin, Jeffrey C.

The results highlight the importance of school leadership, though striking differences emerge in the relative importance of different skill dimensions to different outcomes. The estimates reveal large and highly significant effects of principal value-added to cognitive skills on the productive activities of schooling and work but much weaker effects of value-added to noncognitive skills on these outcomes. In contrast, there is little or no evidence that middle school principals affect the probability a male is arrested and has a guilty disposition by raising cognitive skills but strong evidence that they affect these outcomes through their impacts on noncognitive skills, especially those related to the probability of an out-of-school suspension. In addition, the principal effects on the probability of engagement in the criminal justice system are much larger for Black than for nonBlack males, corresponding to race differences in engagement with the criminal justice system.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32642,32642,24-Jul,NBER,7/8/2024
Industrial Policy in the Global Semiconductor Sector,"Pinelopi K. Goldberg, Réka Juhász, Nathan J. Lane, Giulia Lo Forte & Jeff Thurk","The resurgence of subsidies and industrial policies has raised concerns about their potential inefficiency and alignment with multilateral principles. Critics warn that such policies may divert resources to less efficient firms and provoke retaliatory measures from other countries, leading to a wasteful ""subsidy race."" However, subsidies for sectors with inherent cross-border externalities can have positive global effects. This paper examines these issues within the semiconductor industry: a key driver of economic growth and innovation with potentially significant learning-by-doing and strategic importance due to its dual-use applications.
Our study aims to: (1) document and quantify recent industrial policies in the global semiconductor sector, (2) explore the rationale behind these policies, and (3) evaluate their economic impacts, particularly their cross-border effects, and compatibility with multilateral principles. We employ historical analysis, natural language processing, and a model-based approach to measure government support and its impacts. Our findings indicate that government support has been vital for the industry's growth, with subsidies being the primary form of support. They also highlight the importance of cross-border technology transfers through FDI, business and research collaborations, and technology licensing. China, despite significant subsidies, does not stand out as an outlier compared to other countries, given its market size.
Preliminary model estimates indicate that while learning-by-doing exists, it is smaller than commonly believed, with significant international spillovers. These spillovers likely reflect cross-country technology transfers and the role of fabless clients in disseminating knowledge globally through their interactions with foundries. Such cross-border spillovers are not merely accidental but result from deliberate actions by market participants that cannot be taken for granted. Firms may choose to share knowledge across borders or restrict access to frontier technology, thereby excluding certain countries.

Nenov, Vitor Santos & Alp Simsek","We use data on stock portfolios of Norwegian households to show that stock market wealth increases entrepreneurship by relaxing financial constraints. Our research design isolates idiosyncratic variation in household-level stock market returns. An increase in stock market wealth increases the propensity to start a firm, with the response concentrated in households with moderate levels of financial wealth, for whom a 20 percent increase in wealth due to a positive stock return increases the likelihood to start a firm by about 20%, and in years when the aggregate stock market return in Norway is high. We develop a method to study the effect of wealth on firm outcomes that corrects for the bias introduced by selection into entrepreneurship. Higher wealth causally increases firm profitability, an indication that it relaxes would-be entrepreneurs’ financial constraints. Consistent with this interpretation, the pass-through from stock wealth into equity in the new firm is one-for-one.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32643,32643,24-Jul,NBER,7/8/2024
Unobserved Contributions and Political Influence: Evidence from the Death of Top Donors,"Marco Battaglini, Valerio Leone Sciabolazza, Mengwei Lin & Eleonora Patacchini","It has long been observed that there is little money in U.S. politics compared to the stakes. But what if contributions are not fully observable or non-monetary in nature and thus not easily quantifiable? We study this question with a new data set on the top 1000 donors in U.S. congressional races.  Since top donors do not randomly support candidates, we propose an identification strategy based on information about top donors' deaths and the observed variations in candidates' performance after these events. The death of a top donor significantly decreases a candidate's chances of being elected in the current and future election cycles. Moreover, it affects the legislative activities of elected candidates. These effects do not depend on top donors' monetary contributions to a candidate but on their prominence and their total contributions during the election campaign.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32649,32649,24-Jul,NBER,7/8/2024
College Students and Career Aspirations: Nudging Student Interest in Teaching,"Alvin Christian, Matthew Ronfeldt & Basit Zafar","We survey undergraduate students at a large public university to understand the pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors driving their college major and career decisions with a focus on K-12 teaching. While the average student reports there is a 6% chance they will pursue teaching, almost 27%  report a nonzero chance of working as a teacher in the future. Students, relative to existing statistics, generally believe they would earn substantially more in a non-teaching job (relative to a teaching job). We run a randomized information experiment where we provide students with information on the pecuniary and non-pecuniary job characteristics of teachers and non-teachers. This low-cost informational intervention impacts students' beliefs about their job characteristics if they were to work as a teacher or non-teacher, and increases the reported likelihood they will major or minor in education by 35% and pursue a job as a teacher or in education by 14%. Linking the survey data with administrative transcript records, we find that the intervention had small (and weak) impacts on the decision to minor in education in the subsequent year. Overall, our results indicate that students hold biased beliefs about their career prospects, they update these beliefs when provided with information, and that this information has limited impacts on their choices regarding studying and having a career in teaching.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32641,32641,24-Jul,NBER,7/8/2024
Superstars or Supervillains? Large Firms in the South Korean Growth Miracle,"Jaedo Choi, Andrei A. Levchenko, Dimitrije Ruzic & Younghun Shim","We quantify the contribution of the largest firms to South Korea's economic performance over the period 1972-2011. Using firm-level historical data, we document a novel fact: firm concentration rose substantially during the growth miracle period. To understand whether rising concentration contributed positively or negatively to South Korean real income, we build a quantitative heterogeneous firm small open economy model. Our framework accommodates a variety of potential causes and consequences of changing firm concentration: productivity, distortions, selection into exporting, scale economies, and oligopolistic and oligopsonistic market power in domestic goods and labor markets. The model is implemented directly on the firm-level data and inverted to recover the drivers of concentration. We find that most of the differential performance of the top firms is attributable to higher productivity growth rather than differential distortions. Exceptional performance of the top 3 firms within each sector relative to the average firms contributed 15% to the 2011 real GDP and 4% to the net present value of welfare over the period 1972-2011. Thus, the largest Korean firms were superstars rather than supervillains.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32648,32648,24-Jul,NBER,7/8/2024

Just What the Doctor Ordered? The Benefits and Costs of E-Cigarette Regulation in Australia,"Donald S. Kenkel, Alan D. Mathios, Grace N. Phillips, Revathy Suryanarayana, Hua Wang & Sen Zeng","Australia had adopted a novel approach to e-cigarette policy by requiring a physician’s prescription to lawfully obtain nicotine e-cigarettes. We conducted an online discrete choice experiment to gauge how adult Australian smokers made hypothetical choices between cigarettes, prescription e-cigarettes, non-prescription e-cigarettes, and quitting. We estimate a mixed logit model, which allows us to predict the market shares under different policy scenarios. The mixed logit model also provides estimates of consumer willingness to pay for the benefits from the prescription status of e-cigarettes and the costs of illegal e-cigarette markets. We estimate that the average utility loss from an illegal retail market is worth AU$7.90 per pack-equivalent. We use the corresponding estimates of the compensating variations in income to conduct cost-benefit analyses of possible reforms to Australian e-cigarette regulation. In aggregate, we estimate that the benefits of allowing but not requiring prescriptions of e-cigarettes are AU$1.8 billion per year. Our paper provides a novel contribution to research on e-cigarette regulation and provides a case-study for the policy implementation in Australia. Our paper is also part of our research agenda to explore and develop methods to conduct policy analysis and cost-benefit analysis of regulatory policies that might create illegal markets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32654,32654,24-Jul,NBER,7/8/2024
Banks and Tax-Exempt Debt Arbitrage,James R. Hines Jr. & Emily Horton,"Interest paid by U.S. state and local bonds is tax-exempt, making these bonds attractive to investors – though a tax rule limits arbitrage opportunities by restricting associated interest expense deductions.  Prior to 1986, U.S. banks were not subject to the interest deduction limitation, making banks preferred holders of tax-exempt debt.  U.S. banks used tax-exempt debt to reduce their tax liabilities by roughly 20% in the 1950s and 45% in the 1960s, rising to as much as 80% by the early 1980s.  Despite their special exemption, and in part because of their widespread holdings, banks did not benefit from investing in tax-exempt bonds, as competition between banks reduced bond yields to the point of investor indifference.  The absence of a tax benefit from arbitrage appears not only in observed bond yields, but also in banks’ considerable unused potential for further tax reductions.  After the Tax Reform Act of 1986 removed their special tax exemption, banks significantly reduced their holdings of tax-exempt debt, particularly among banks most severely impacted by the rule change.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32647,32647,24-Jul,NBER,7/8/2024

Timing Sustainable Engagement in Real Asset Investments,"Bram van der Kroft, Juan Palacios, Roberto Rigobon & Siqi Zheng","This paper estimates the effect of sustainable shareholder engagement on firm's investments. We study the real estate industry where investments are sporadic and occur following depreciation cycles. SEC restrictions (rule 240.14a-8) on shareholder proposals, in combination with the asset depreciation cycles, create random variation enabling us to identify firms' sustainable investment decisions. Using unique micro-data tracking investments in all public US commercial real estate properties over the past two decades, we find that sustainable engagement effectively steers firms to initiate tangible and long-lasting sustainable retrofits. However, engagement is ineffective or impairs such investments when it does not coincide with reinvestment periods, or investors vote down the proposal.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32646,32646,24-Jul,NBER,7/8/2024

Republicans' expectations not only rose well above the inflation target, but also became more sensitive to a variety of shocks, including CPI releases and energy prices. We then exploit geographic variation in political affiliation at the MSA level to show that the partial de-anchoring of expectations had implications for realized inflation.

Estimation of Nonlinear Exchange Rate Dynamics in Evolving Regimes,"Jeffrey A. Frankel, Yao Hou & Danxia Xie","This paper develops a new econometric framework to estimate and classify exchange rate regimes. They are classified into four distinct categories: fixed exchange rates, BBC (band, basket and crawl), managed floating, and freely floating. The procedure captures the patterns of exchange rate dynamics and the interventions by authorities under each of the regimes. We pay particular attention to the BBC and offer a new approach to parameter estimation by utilizing a three-regime Threshold Auto Regressive (TAR) model to reveal the nonlinear nature of exchange rate dynamics. We further extend our benchmark framework to allow the evolution of exchange rate regimes over time by adopting the minimum description length (MDL) principle, to overcome the challenge of simultaneous two-dimensional inference of nonlinearity in the state dimension and structural breaks in the time dimension. We apply our framework to 26 countries. The results suggest that exchange rate dynamics under different regimes are well captured by our new framework.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32644,32644,24-Jul,NBER,7/8/2024
How Do Physicians Respond to New Medical Research?,"Philip DeCicca, Maripier Isabelle & Natalie Malak","What happens when the findings of a prominent medical study are overturned?  Using a medical trial on breech births, we estimate the effect of the reversal of such a medical study on physician choices and infant health outcomes.  Using the United States Birth Certificate Records from 1995-2010, we employ a difference-in-differences estimator for C-sections, low Apgar, and low birth weight measures. We find that the reversal of a multi-site, high profile, randomized control trial on the appropriate delivery of term breech births, the Term Breech Trial (TBT), led to a 15-23 percent decline in C-sections for such births at a time when the overall trend in C-sections was rising. We find our largest estimated effects amongst traditionally disadvantaged groups.  However, we do not find that such a change in practice had significant impacts on infant health. Contrary to prior studies, we find that physicians updated their beliefs quickly, and do indeed adjust to new medical research, particularly young physicians, prior to mandatory policy or professional guidelines.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32656,32656,24-Jul,NBER,7/8/2024

We construct a money metric measure of welfare that accounts for public goods (by using personalized prices) and the allocation of time. We then use our conceptual framework to analyse intrahousehold inequality in Japan, allowing for the presence of two public goods: expenditures on children and other public goods including housing. We show empirically that women have much stronger preferences for both public goods and this has critical implications for the distribution of welfare in the household.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32645,32645,24-Jul,NBER,7/8/2024

In countries where international transactions are restricted, crypto exchanges effectively allow domestic agents to pay a premium to buy foreign currency. The counterparts to these transactions are agents with access to FX, who sell crypto holdings purchased abroad. A stylized model illustrates that restricted foreign currency amid economic imbalances incentivizes these transactions via persistent crypto premia in local relative to global markets. We analyze relative crypto pricing data in several country case studies, providing empirical support that crypto markets serve as marketplaces for capital flight that already took place, rather than a novel channel for capital flight. We make available a novel dataset on crypto market premia, which we propose as indicators of excess demand for foreign currency and capital control intensity. The dataset will be posted along with this paper and updated periodically.","Fri, 28 Jun 2024 ",IMF,7/9/2024
Sovereign Debt Restructuring and Credit Recovery,Violeta A. Gutkowski,"This paper focuses on the significant growth of domestic credit once the debt is restructured and shows that is not correlated with the size of the haircut. Second, it performs an event study around Ecuador’s sovereign default and restructuring of 2008-2009 to study changes in domestic bank lending behavior. After external debt restructuring, private lending increased the most for banks highly exposed to public debt. Finally, it provides a simple model were uncertainty about the return on government external debt during default has spillover effects on the domestic economy by creating dispersion in beliefs across domestic banks, which leads to a misallocation of credit. External debt restructuring  eliminates domestic belief heterogeneity by making the return on bonds observable to everyone. This simple framing is not only consistent with the substantial growth in domestic credit upon debt restructuring but also with its independence from the haircut size observed in the data.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-015,2024-015A,24-Jul,FED-STLOUIS,7/9/2024

Beyond Debt: Net Worth Fiscal Anchors,Hua Chai ; Jason Harris ; Alexander F. Tieman,"This paper proposes anchoring medium- to long-term fiscal policy in a Public Sector Net Worth (PSNW) target. Such a target widens the scope of fiscal policy to include public sector assets, in addition to liabilities—the focus of debt-based rules. A PSNW target is directly relevant to ongoing policy debates on green fiscal rules and more generally, the reform of fiscal frameworks (such as the Euro Area’s) to allow for public investment in a high debt environment. Modeling a small open economy with public investment and endogenous growth, we show that, compared to debt-based anchors, a PSNW anchor is more conducive to public investment and economic growth, while providing for sensible policy reactions to changes in long-term interest rates. The net worth anchor also precludes unsustainable debt dynamics. Simulated transition dynamics show that replacing a debt anchor with a net worth anchor does not necessarily lead to higher debt-to-GDP ratios. In addition to the merits of a net worth anchor, the paper also discusses some operational challenges.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/07/08/Beyond-Debt-Net-Worth-Fiscal-Anchors-551340,2024-137,"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 ",IMF,7/10/2024
When Is the Use of Gaussian-inverse Wishart-Haar Priors Appropriate?,Atsushi Inoue and Lutz Kilian,"Several recent studies have expressed concern that the Haar prior typically employed in estimating sign-identified VAR models is driving the prior about the structural impulse responses and hence their posterior. In this paper, we provide evidence that the quantitative importance of the Haar prior for posterior inference has been overstated. How sensitive posterior inference is to the Haar prior depends on the width of the identified set of a given impulse response. We demonstrate that this width depends not only on how much the identified set is narrowed by the identifying restrictions imposed on the model, but also depends on the data through the reduced-form model parameters. Hence, the role of the Haar prior can only be assessed on a case-by-case basis. We show by example that, when the identification is sufficiently tight, posterior inference based on a Gaussian-inverse Wishart-Haar prior provides a reasonably accurate approximation.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2404.pdf,2404,7-Jul-24,FED-DALLAS,7/10/2024
A Semi-Structural Model for Credit Cycle and Policy Analysis – An Application for Luxembourg,Carlos de Resende ; Alexandra Solovyeva ; Moez Souissi,"The paper explores the nexus between the financial and business cycles in a semi-structural New Keynesian model with a financial accelerator, an active banking sector, and an endogenous macroprudential policy reaction function. We parametrize the model for Luxembourg through a mix of calibration and Bayesian estimation techniques. The model features dynamic properties that align with theoretical priors and empirical evidence and displays sensible data-matching and forecasting capabilities, especially for credit indicators. We find that the credit gap, which remained positive during COVID-19 amid continued favorable financial conditions and policy support, had been closing by mid-2022. Model-based forecasts using data up to 2022Q2 and conditional on the October 2022 WEO projections for the Euro area suggest that Luxembourg's business and credit cycles would deteriorate until late 2024. Based on these insights about the current and projected positions in the credit cycle, the model can guide policymakers on how to adjust the macroprudential policy stance. Policy simulations suggest that the weights given to measures of credit-to-GDP and asset price gaps in the macroprudential policy rule should be well-calibrated to avoid unwarranted volatility in the policy response.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/07/09/A-Semi-Structural-Model-for-Credit-Cycle-and-Policy-Analysis-An-Application-for-Luxembourg-551447,2024-140,"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 ",IMF,7/10/2024
Bank Profitability in Europe: Not Here to Stay,Ruo Chen ; Vincenzo Guzzo ; Fazurin Jamaludin ; Adil Mohommad ; Ritong Qu ; Yueshu Zhao,"Slower passthrough of policy interest rate hikes to deposit rates relative to their loan rates has led to sharply wider bank net interest margins. Combined with resilient asset quality, wider net interest margins supported record profits for European banks in 2023. Drawing on historical data from the balance sheets and income statements of over 2,500 European banks, this paper shows that abnormally high profits are expected to fade soon as interest income will decline, once policy rates start being lowered, while higher impairment costs historically have weighed on profits with a lag. Moreover, a number of structural factors that have eroded the performance of European banks in the past two decades have largely remained unaddressed and will continue being a drag on profits and capital. Therefore, policymakers should encourage banks to preserve capital buffers and build resilience to future shocks, while exercising caution when considering taxes on profits or other measures that could divert potential sources of capital from banks.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/07/09/Bank-Profitability-in-Europe-Not-Here-to-Stay-551129,2024-142,"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 ",IMF,7/10/2024
Unraveling the Wage-Output Disconnect: The Role of Labor Market Power,Melih Firat ; Can Sever,"In this paper, we theoretically and empirically explore the role of firm labor market power in the wage-output relationship. We start by laying out a theoretical model with imperfect labor mobility between firms and sectors, which implies upward-sloping labor supply curves that firms face, allowing firms to have labor market power (i.e., wage markdown). Assuming firm heterogeneity under oligopsony, markdowns can be represented as a function of firm labor market share. The model implies that firms with higher labor market share, indicated by a higher payroll share in their respective sectors, exhibit a weaker relationship between the changes in wages and output. We test the model’s prediction using data from the European subsample of the ORBIS dataset spanning from 2000 to 2018. We find that: (i) the pass-through of firm value added growth to wage growth is lower for firms with a higher payroll share in their sectors, with about one-fifth of the pass-through disappearing in firms at the top 1 percentile of the payroll share distribution, relative to an atomic firm; (ii) this pattern holds across various subsamples and timeframes, and also after accounting for several alternative explanations; and (iii) the weakening in the link between value added and wages growth due to firm labor market power intensifies during the downturns in the labor market or in the overall economy.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/07/08/Unraveling-the-Wage-Output-Disconnect-The-Role-of-Labor-Market-Power-551364,2024-136,"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 ",IMF,7/10/2024

Catch up to the technological frontier has been uneven, with limited progress in agriculture, but also in construction and trade, which have grown the most in terms of employment. We do find some Indian firms already operating at the technological frontier. These strong performers tend to be large firms. We then consider India’s employment challenge going forward.

The Heterogeneous Effects of Uncertainty on Trade,Ibrahim Nana ; Rasmané Ouedraogo ; Sampawende J Tapsoba,"This paper empirically investigates the relationship between uncertainty and trade. We use a gravity model for 143 countries over the 1980-2021 period to assess the impact of uncertainty on bilateral trade. We confirm that, in general, uncertainty has a negative impact on trade. The findings suggest that a one standard deviation increase in global uncertainty is associated with a decline in bilateral trade by 4.5 percent, with fuel and industrial products trade being the most impacted. This negative impact is observed for uncertainty on both sides of the border, with a higher impact of uncertainty from the importing country. The article goes deeper into the analysis and shows that deeper trade integration (horizontal integration) mitigates the negative impact of uncertainty on trade. In contrast, higher participation in global value chains (vertical integration) amplifies the negative effect of uncertainty on trade. We find that geopolitical tensions amplify the deterrent effect of uncertainty on trade. Finally, the result is heterogeneous across income levels, regions, and resource endowment: (a) uncertainty has a negative impact on bilateral trade between Emerging Markets and Developing Economies and Advanced Economies; however, (b) at the regional level, Africa and Europe’s intraregional trade decrease as uncertainty surges.

Bank Profits and Bank Taxes in the EU,Morgan Maneely ; Lev Ratnovski,"Since 2022, EU banks have been enjoying historically high profits. The profits are mostly driven by the delayed pass-through of the rapid monetary policy tightening to deposit rates and as such are likely transitory. Against this background, almost half of EU countries have introduced new taxes on banks. This paper documents the significant diversity in the design of the new bank taxes—in terms of their tax base, rate, duration, and burden. The paper discusses several trade-offs in the design of bank taxes and argues that an alternative or complementary policy response to temporarily high bank profits is to lock them in as usable bank capital, for example through an increase in countercyclical capital buffer rates.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/07/09/Bank-Profits-and-Bank-Taxes-in-the-EU-551126,2024-143,"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 ",IMF,7/10/2024

We exploit the largest and swiftest increase in interest rates since the creation of the euro and find that banks with a higher exposure to interest rate risk, i.e., with a larger duration gap after accounting for hedging, curtailed corporate lending more than their peers. Ceteris paribus, greater interest rate risk entails closer supervisory scrutiny and potential capital surcharges in the short term, and lower expected profitability and capital accumulation in the medium to long term. We then proceed to dissect banks’ credit allocation and find that banks with higher net duration reshuffled their loan portfolio away from long-term loans in an attempt to limit the increase in interest rate risk and targetedtheir lending contraction to small and micro firms. Firms exposed to banks with a larger exposure to interest rate risk were unable to fully rebalance their borrowing needs with other lenders, thus experiencing a relatively larger decrease in total borrowing during the monetary tightening episode.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2950~681c40ac7f.en.pdf?88060d946137e9b90fdce7b255a57edc,2950,9-Jul-24,ECB,7/11/2024
Buying insurance at low economic cost – the effects of bank capital buffer increases since the pandemic,"Markus Behn, Marco Forletta, Alessio Reghezza","Using granular data from the European corporate credit register, we examine how increases in macroprudential capital buffer requirements since the pandemic have affected bank lending behaviour in the euro area. Our findings reveal that, for the average bank, the buffer requirement increases did not have a statistically significant impact on lending to non-financial corporations. Furthermore, while we document relatively slower loan growth for banks with less capital headroom, also these banks did not decrease lending in absolute terms in response to higher requirements. These findings are robustin various specifications and emerge for both loan growth at the bank-firm level and the propensity to establish new bank-firm relationships. At the firm level, we document some heterogeneity depending on firm type and firm size. Firms with a single bank relationship and small and micro enterprises experienced a relative reduction in lending following buffer increases, although substitution effects mitigated real effects at the firm level. Overall, the results suggest that the pronounced macroprudential tightening since late 2021 did not exert substantial negative effects on credit supply.Hence, activating releasable capital buffers at an early stage of the cycle appears to be a robust policy strategy, since the costs of doing so are expected to be low.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2951~e55e828e44.en.pdf?1ee9dfcf059901a6982d61fb3e3965db,2951,10-Jul-24,ECB,7/11/2024
CRE Redevelopment Options and the Use of Mortgage Financing,"David Glancy, Robert Kurtzman, Lara Loewenstein","A significant share of commercial real estate (CRE) investment properties—about half by our estimates—are purchased without a mortgage. Using comprehensive microdata on transactions in the US CRE market, we analyze which types of properties are purchased without a mortgage, highlighting the important role of renovation or redevelopment options. We show that mortgage-financed properties are less likely to be subsequently redeveloped, and that owners anticipate these redevelopment frictions and avoid mortgage financing for properties with greater redevelopment options. These effects were even stronger during the COVID-19 pandemic, when uncertainty increased redevelopment option values.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2415-cre-redevelopment-options-and-use-of-mortgage-financing,24-15,07.10.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,7/11/2024
(Re-)Connecting Inflation and the Labor Market: A Tale of Two Curves,Hie Joo Ahn and Jeremy B. Rudd,"We propose an empirical framework in which shocks to worker reallocation, aggregate activity, and labor supply drive the joint dynamics of labor market outcomes and inflation, and where reallocation shocks take two forms depending on whether they result from quits or from job loss. In order to link our approach with previous theoretical and empirical work, we extend the procedure for estimating a Bayesian sign-restricted VAR so that priors can be directly imposed on the VAR's impact matrix. We find that structural shocks that shift the Beveridge curve have different effects on inflation. Our model allows us to fully decompose movements of or along the empirical Beveridge curve in terms of the contribution of each shock and also allows us to estimate the Phillips correlation associated with each shock; our results imply that observed Beveridge and Phillips correlations can change over time depending on what types of structural shocks predominate in a given period. Applying our model to the pandemic-related recession and recovery, we find that reallocation shocks were a key source of labor market dynamics during this period and explain how a post-pandemic ""soft landing,’’ in which inflation declined without a significant rise in unemployment, was possible.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/reconnecting-inflation-and-the-labor-market-a-tale-of-two-curves.htm,2024-050,24-Jul,FED-BOARD,7/12/2024

Predicting Analysts’ S&P 500 Earnings Forecast Errors and Stock Market Returns using Macroeconomic Data and Nowcasts,Steven A. Sharpe and Antonio Gil de Rubio Cruz,"This study scrutinizes the quality of “bottom-up” forecasts of near-term S&P 500 Composite earnings, derived by aggregating analysts’ forecasts for individual firm-level earnings. We examine whether forecasts are broadly consistent with current macroeconomic conditions reflected in economists’ near-term outlook and other available data. To the contrary, we find that a simple macroeconomic model of aggregate S&P 500 earnings, coupled with GDP forecasts from the Blue Chip Survey and recent dollar exchange rate movements, can predict large and statistically significant errors in equity analysts’ bottom-up forecasts for S&P 500 earnings in the current quarter and the quarter ahead. This finding is robust to the requirement that our econometric model is calibrated using only data available at the time of forecast. Moreover, the discrepancy between the macro-model-based earnings forecasts and analysts’ forecasts has predictive power for 3-month-ahead stock returns.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/predicting-analysts-sp-500-earnings-forecast-errors-and-stock-market-returns-using-macroeconomic-data-and-nowcasts.htm,2024-049,24-Jul,FED-BOARD,7/12/2024
Optimal Design of Contingent Capital,Lionel Melin and Ahyan Panjwani,"This paper proposes a parsimonious framework for designing contingent capital contracts (CoCos). CoCos designed this way (i) are either optimal or incentive compatible for equity holders, (ii) implement a unique equilibrium, and (iii) result in an optimal capital structure for the firm. We consider CoCos with equity conversion and write-down modalities. Equity conversion CoCos are optimal; write-down CoCos are incentive-compatible. Both types of CoCos can be implemented by exogenously specifying a capital ratio rule that triggers conversion and, hence, qualify as additional tier 1 (AT1) capital. A policymaker can use a normative criterion, e.g., capital ratio after conversion, to determine the desired capital ratio rule ex-ante. Given the policymaker's choice of the capital ratio rule, our model pins down the CoCo that respects (i), (ii), and (iii). We show that including such a CoCo in the firm's capital structure increases its optimal levered value while making it more resilient to bankruptcy. Lastly, CoCos in this framework are time-consistent. This characteristic alleviates the risk of renegotiation by stakeholders and removes the uncertainty of a discretionary trigger: precisely what spooked markets during the run on Credit Suisse in March 2023.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/optimal-design-of-contingent-capital.htm,2024-051,24-Jul,FED-BOARD,7/12/2024

"Human capital ladders, cyclical sorting, and hysteresis","Edoardo Maria Acabbi, Andrea Alati and Luca Mazzone","Using administrative data, we document that workers acquire more human capital at more productive firms. Recessions distort workers-firm sorting, flatten the job ladder and impact human capital accumulation, as workers match on average to worse firms. To quantify the aggregate relevance of these effects, we build a directed search model with aggregate risk and worker-firm heterogeneity, in which human capital accumulation depends on firm quality. We estimate the model and show that recessions have persistent negative effects on the productivity of worker-firm matches, with distortions in sorting and human capital accumulation accounting for approximately 30% of cumulative output losses.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/human-capital-ladders-cyclical-sorting-and-hysteresis,1077,"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 ",BOE,7/13/2024
Knowledge Diffusion Through FDI: Worldwide Firm-Level Evidence,JaeBin Ahn ; Chan Kim ; Nan Li ; Andrea Manera,"This paper examines the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on knowledge diffusion by analyzing the effect of firm-level FDI activities on cross-border patent citations. We construct a novel firm-level panel dataset that combines worldwide utility patent and citations data with project-level greenfield FDI and crossborder mergers and acquisitions (M&A) data over the past two decades, covering firms across 60 countries. Applying a new local projection difference-indifferences methodology, our analysis reveals that FDI significantly enhances knowledge flows both from and to the investing firms. Citation flows between investing firms and host countries increase by up to around 10.6% to 13% in five years after the initial investment. These effects are stronger when host countries have higher innovation capacities or are technologically more similar to the investing firm. We also uncover knowledge spillovers beyond targeted firms and industries in host countries, which are particularly more pronounced for sectors closely connected in the technology space.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/07/12/Knowledge-Diffusion-Through-FDI-Worldwide-Firm-Level-Evidence-551408,2024-152,"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 ",IMF,7/13/2024

Distributional Impacts of Heterogenous Carbon Prices in the EU,Magnus Merkle ; Geoffroy Dolphin,"We analyse the consequences of carbon price heterogeneity on households in The EU from 2010 to 2020. Accounting for both heterogeneity in carbon pricing across emission sources and the indirect effects from inter-industry linkages, we obtain two key findings. First, due to widespread carbon pricing exemptions, household burdens are lower than previously estimated. Second, lower-income groups are affected disproportionately, because they spend a smaller share of their expenditure on products that benefit from exemptions than their higher-income counterparts. Therefore, imposing uniform carbon prices both within and across countries would reduce carbon pricing regressivity on household expenditure in the EU. A global price would be most effective in this regard, as it would raise carbon prices embodied in EU imports. Further, because EU economies are open and apply higher average carbon prices than their trade partners, the domestic revenues exceed the costs embodied in EU household consumptions bundles. This increases the scope for reducing the burden of carbon pricing on lower-income households through revenue redistribution. Our results imply that the ongoing extension of carbon pricing to more sectors through the EU ETS II and the introduction of the EU’s CBAM should make carbon pricing less regressive, all else equal.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/07/12/Distributional-Impacts-of-Heterogenous-Carbon-Prices-in-the-EU-551414,2024-149,"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 ",IMF,7/13/2024

Climate Transition Risk and Financial Stability in France,Rachel Lee ; Hugo Rojas-Romagosa ; Iulia Ruxandra Teodoru ; Xiaoxiao Zhang,"This study empirically investigates the impact of the climate transition on the French financial sector using a micro-macro approach to examine the long-term effects of climate mitigation and decarbonization policies on sectoral output and the effects on firm profitability and the likelihood of corporate defaults. We employ a recursive-dynamic, multi-regional, multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate the Fit-for-55 climate scenario and then integrate the sectoral output paths derived from the model into firm-level corporate balance sheets and risks. We then assess the extent of credit exposure of banks to energy-intensive sectors. Our findings indicate that, under the Fit-for-55 scenario, the mining, chemicals and manufacturing sectors might face notable increases in their probability of defaults, in turn creating pockets of vulnerabilities in some parts of the banking system depending on their exposure to these energy-intensive sectors.

The model matches the age patterns in the level and dispersion of labor income and financial wealth in the U.S. despite the absence of preference heterogeneity and portfolio adjustment costs. Monetary policy affects the consumption of young households mainly through labor income and the consumption of old households mainly through asset returns. More than half of the aggregate consumption response to an expansionary monetary policy shock comes from those below the age of 40.

For example, a real-time decomposition of the 10-yr. Treasury yield shows term premiums essentially equal in late 2013 and 2023, while the long-run value of expected short-term interest rates is estimated to have fallen in a manner similar to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections and estimates from research on long-run neutral interest rates.

"Controls, not shocks: estimating dynamic causal effects in macroeconomics",Simon Lloyd and Ed Manuel,"A common approach to estimating causal effects in macroeconomics involves constructing orthogonalised ‘shocks’ then integrating them into local projections or vector autoregressions. For a general set of estimators, we show that this two-step ‘shock-first’ approach can be problematic for identification and inference relative to a one-step procedure which simply adds appropriate controls directly in the outcome regression. We show this analytically by comparing one and two-step estimators without assumptions on underlying data-generating processes. In simple ordinary least squares (OLS) settings, the two approaches yield identical coefficients, but two-step inference is unnecessarily conservative. More generally, one and two-step estimates can differ due to omitted-variable bias in the latter when additional controls are included in the second stage or when employing non-OLS estimators. In monetary-policy applications controlling for central-bank information, one-step estimates indicate that the (dis)inflationary consequences of US monetary policy are more robust than previously realised, not subject to a ‘price puzzle’.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/controls-not-shocks-estimating-dynamic-causal-effects-in-macroeconomics,1079,"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 ",BOE,7/13/2024

Markups and Entry in a Circular Hotelling Model,Robert J. Barro,The Hotelling locational model and its adaptations to a circular city provide a core framework for research in industrial organization.  The present paper expands the explanatory power of this model by incorporating a continuum of consumers with constant-elasticity demand functions along with stores that have constant marginal costs of production.  The stores are evenly spaced in equilibrium.  The model generates a simple formula in which the markup of price over marginal cost depends on the spacing between stores and a transportation-cost parameter but is independent of the elasticity of demand.  This result reflects pricing decisions by stores that factor in the threat of losing business entirely at the borders with neighboring stores.  The free-entry solutions for the number of stores and their spacing approximate socially optimal values but quantities of goods consumed are inefficiently low.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w32660,32660,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024

The environment examined starts with users who contribute based on their motives to create a public good. Their own actions determine the quality of that public good but also embed a free-rider problem. When AI is trained on that data, it can generate similar contributions to the public good. It is shown that this increases the incentive of human users to provide contributions that are more costly to supply. Thus, the overall quality of contributions from both AI and humans rises compared to human-only contributions. In situations where platform providers want to generate more contributions using explicit incentives, the rate of return on such incentives is shown to be lower in this environment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32686,32686,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Designing Scientific Grants,"Christoph Carnehl, Marco Ottaviani & Justus Preusser","This paper overviews the economics of scientific grants, focusing on the interplay between the inherent uncertainty in research, researchers' incentives, and grant design. Grants differ from traditional market systems and other science and innovation policy tools, such as prizes and patents. We outline the main economic forces specific to science, noting the limited attention given to grant funding in the economics literature. Using tools from information economics, we identify key incentive problems at various stages of the grant funding process and offer guidance for effective grant design.
In the allocation stage, funders aim to select the highest-merit applications while minimizing evaluation costs. The selection rule, in turn, impacts researchers' incentives to apply and invest in their proposals. In the grant management stage, funders monitor researchers to ensure efficient use of funds. We discuss the advantages and potential pitfalls of (partial) lotteries and emphasize the effectiveness of staged grant design in promoting a productive use of grants.
Beyond these broadly applicable insights, our overview highlights the need for further research on grantmaking. Understudied areas include, at the micro level, the interplay of different grant funding stages, and at the macro level, the interaction of grants with other instruments in the market for science.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32668,32668,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024

We find substantial correlations between test scores and long-run TVA but zero correlations between these two TVA measures and behavior TVA. We find that short-term test-score TVA and long-run TVA are highly correlated and equally good predictors of long-term outcomes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32671,32671,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Demand for Artificial Intelligence in Settlement Negotiations,Joshua S. Gans,"When AI prediction substantially resolves trial uncertainty, a party purchasing AI prediction will disclose it if it is in their favour and not otherwise, signalling the outcome to the other party. Thus, the trial outcome becomes common knowledge. However, this implies that the parties will settle rather than purchase the AI prediction. When parties have differing prior beliefs regarding trial outcomes, these differences are only resolved if the AI prediction is purchased and utilised. In this case, AI will be purchased in equilibrium. Different trial cost allocation rules awarding all costs to the losing party (the English Rule) or having each party bear their own costs (the American Rule) can impact the demand for AI for settlement negotiations, but how this occurs interacts with the expectations regarding whether a settlement will occur or not in AI's absence.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32685,32685,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Driving Change: Evaluating Connecticut's Collaborative Approach to Reducing Racial Disparities in Policing,"Susan T. Parker, Matthew B. Ross & Stephen Ross","We examine a statewide program that identifies police departments with large racial disparities in traffic stops and works with identified departments to reduce disparities. The intervention caused large (23.56%) and persistent (at least 12 months) reductions in the number of minorities involved in traffic stops, with no impact on stops of white drivers. Reductions in traffic stops involving minority drivers primarily result from fewer pretextual stops (85%) for lighting violations and non-moving violations. We find relative declines of approximately 30% for stops resulting in a warning or an arrest. Using data on crime and vehicle crashes, we find no evidence that crashes increase after traffic stops fall, but we do find moderate declines in the clearance rates for property crime.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32692,32692,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
The Effects of the 2021 Child Tax Credit on Parents’ Psychological Well-Being,Lisa A. Gennetian & Anna Gassman-Pines,"Although improving psychological well-being was not the explicit focus of the 2021 expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC), psychological health outcomes may have been affected by the positive income shocks generated by the credit. In this chapter we ask: How did the 2021 expanded CTC affect parents’ psychological well-being? Some studies have found that the CTC led to reductions in parental reports of clinical levels of depression and anxiety and in subclinical depressive and anxiety symptoms. Using similar methods, other studies have found no effect on these same outcomes. Importantly, however, the evidence does not point to the CTC worsening psychological well-being. We conclude that the evidence so far is thin, narrow, and mixed, even when our review is expanded to comparable studies on the impact of income support. Alignment of policy objectives with a broader range of measurement approaches will be important in building a more conclusive evidence base.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32662,32662,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Identifying Shocks to Systematic Risk in Times of Crisis,"Jacob Boudoukh, Yukun Liu, Tobias J. Moskowitz & Matthew P. Richardson","We characterize how risk evolves during a crisis. Using high-frequency data, we find that the first two principal components (PCs) of the covariance matrix of global asset returns experience large, sudden, and temporary spikes coinciding with well-known crises – Covid-19 pandemic, Global Financial Crisis, and Brexit. Despite the origin of these crises being very different, the risk dynamics share remarkably common features: PC1 shocks come solely from asset volatility, while PC2 shocks come from changing loadings/composition, effectively making it a “crisis” factor. Using the exogenous nature of Covid-19, we provide novel identification of risk dynamics by linking these changes to news about the virus and epidemiological model forecast errors over time and across countries. We conclude with investment implications, where shocks to systematic risk sharply reduce diversification benefits and ex ante attempts to hedge it are futile, which may be a defining characteristic of a crisis – that it is unavoidable.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32693,32693,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
"Labor Market Matching, Wages, and Amenities","Thibaut Lamadon, Jeremy Lise, Costas Meghir & Jean-Marc Robin","This paper develops the nonparametric identification of models with production complementarities, worker-firm specific disutility of labor and search frictions. Mobility in the model is subject to preference shocks, and we assume that firms can write wage contracts. We develop a constructive proof for the nonparametric identification of the model primitives from matched employer-employee data. We use the estimated model to decompose the sources of wage dispersion into worker heterogeneity, compensating differentials, and search frictions that generate between-firm and within-firm dispersion. We find that compensating differentials are substantial on average, but the contribution differs greatly between the lowest and highest types of workers. Finally, we use the model to provide an economic interpretation of several empirical regularities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32687,32687,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
"McCarthyism, Media, and Political Repression: Evidence from Hollywood",Hui Ren Tan & Tianyi Wang,"We study a far-reaching episode of demagoguery in American history. From the late 1940s to 1950s, anti-communist hysteria led by Senator Joseph McCarthy and others gripped the nation. Hundreds of professionals in Hollywood were accused of having ties with the communist. We show that these accusations were not random, targeting those with dissenting views. Actors and screenwriters who were accused suffered a setback in their careers. Beyond the accused, we find that the anti-communist crusade also had a chilling effect on film content, as non-accused filmmakers avoided progressive topics. The decline in progressive films, in turn, made society more conservative.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32682,32682,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Beliefs About the Economy are Excessively Sensitive to Household-Level Shocks: Evidence from Linked Survey and Administrative Data,Dmitry Taubinsky ⓡ Luigi Butera ⓡ Matteo Saccarola ⓡ Chen Lian,"We study how people's beliefs about the economy covary with household-level events, utilizing a unique link between Danish administrative data and a large-scale survey of consumer expectations. We find that compared to actual inflation, people's inflation forecasts covary much more strongly (and negatively) with both recently realized household income changes and measures of expected future household income changes. We formally establish that these findings are stark deviations from the Bayesian limited-information rational expectations (LIRE) benchmark. Similar results hold for perceptions of past inflation (""backcasts""), suggesting that imperfect recall is a key mechanism for biased forecasts. Building on this, a series of additional tests, some of which utilize data on adverse health events, suggests that the forecast biases are at least partly due to selective recall cued by affective associations. That is, negative (positive) household-level events cue negative (positive) recollections, which lead to pessimistic (optimistic) forecasts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32664,32664,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
"Codification, Technology Absorption, and the Globalization of the Industrial Revolution","Réka Juhász, Shogo Sakabe & David Weinstein","This paper studies technology absorption worldwide in the late nineteenth century. We construct several novel datasets to test the idea that the codification of technical knowledge in the vernacular was necessary for countries to absorb the technologies of the Industrial Revolution. We find that comparative advantage shifted to industries that could benefit from patents only in countries and colonies that had access to codified technical knowledge but not in other regions. Using the rapid and unprecedented codification of technical knowledge in Meiji Japan as a natural experiment, we show that this pattern appeared in Japan only after the Japanese government codified as much technical knowledge as what was available in Germany in 1870. Our findings shed new light on the frictions associated with technology diffusion and offer a novel take on why Meiji Japan was unique among non-Western countries in successfully industrializing during the first wave of globalization.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32667,32667,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
On the Determinants of Young Adult Outcomes: Impacts of Randomly Assigned Neighborhoods For Children in Military Families,"Laura Kawano, Bruce Sacerdote, William L. Skimmyhorn & Michael Stevens","Using the quasi-random assignment of 760,000 children in U.S. military families, we show that neighborhood attributes experienced during childhood have powerful impacts on SAT scores, college-going and earnings. For earnings and college going outcomes, location during high school is twice as important as location during elementary school, and for SAT scores, location during middle school has the strongest impact. There is little evidence of positive interactions in neighborhood quality across ages groups. Importantly, the same locations benefit children with equal potency across race or sex. Twenty years of exposure in a 1 standard deviation ""better"" county raises SAT composite scores by 10 points (1.8 percentiles), raises college attendance by 1.7 percentage points, earnings by 2.2 percentile points, and lowers EITC receipt by 10%. Impacts are three times more potent when we measure neighborhood quality at the zip code level: twenty years of exposure to a one (county level) standard deviation better zip code raises college going by 6.7 percentage points, SAT composite by 38 points and income percentile at age 25 by 6.1 points. By equalizing average neighborhood quality for Black and White families, we estimate that the Army's quasi-random assignment reduces Black-white earnings gaps among the children of Army personnel by 23%.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32674,32674,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
CEO Compensation and Adverse Shocks: Evidence from Changes in Environmental Regulations,"Seungho Choi, Ross Levine, Raphael Park & Simon Xu","Although corporate finance theory suggests how adverse shocks influence shareholder preferences toward corporate risk-taking and executive compensation, few researchers explore this relationship empirically. We construct a firm-year measure of unexpected shocks to environmental regulatory stringency. We find that adverse environmental regulatory shocks typically prompt corporate boards to reduce the risk-taking incentives of CEO compensation. However, this pattern is not uniform. Financially distressed firms exhibit milder reductions in compensation convexity, with some even increasing it, suggesting a “gambling for resurrection” strategy. Moreover, the strength of corporate governance influences shareholders’ capacity to align executive incentives with changing shareholder risk preferences.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32663,32663,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Investment in Preventive Care for Children of Middle Eastern Ancestry During the Trump Administration,"Shooshan Danagoulian, Owen Fleming, Daniel S. Grossman & David Slusky","Individuals of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) ancestry in the US have been targeted by anti-immigrant and counterterrorism policies and have been the focus of vitriolic political rhetoric.  Despite this, lack of data identifying MENA individuals has prevented systematic evaluation of the impact of these policies and rhetoric on MENA communities’ wellbeing, including investment in health capital.  This paper begins to address this gap in knowledge using a large, longitudinal medical records database with expanded race and ethnicity measures to describe disparities and evaluate the impact of immigration policies and anti-MENA rhetoric on preventive care use among MENA children in the US.  Specifically, we evaluate the election of Donald Trump, and find that the election decreased MENA children’s utilization of vaccinations and well visits. Documenting MENA health and outcomes following official US policy and rhetoric is paramount for understanding the full consequences of policies that target underrepresented groups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32676,32676,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Donald Trump's words,Nikita Savin & Daniel Treisman,"Donald Trump’s campaign speeches have impressed some and outraged others. Yet relatively little is known about how his rhetoric has changed over time and how it compares to that of other politicians, both in the US and abroad. We analyze a monthly series of Trump’s public addresses in 2015-24, comparing them to speeches by other U.S. presidential candidates and various world leaders, past and present. We find that Trump’s use of violent vocabulary has increased over time—reflecting increasing attention to wars but even more to crime—and now surpasses that of all other democratic politicians we studied. Simultaneously, Trump’s use of words related to economic performance has declined, matching a general trend among presidential candidates. Finally, although containing populist elements, Trump’s rhetoric diverges from the populist stereotype in notable ways, particularly in his relatively infrequent references to “the people.” He increasingly exemplifies a negative populism, concentrated on denigrating out-groups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32665,32665,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024

Lessons from the Biggest Business Tax Cut in US History,"Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, Owen M. Zidar & Eric Zwick","We assess the business provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the biggest corporate tax cut in US history. We draw five lessons. First, corporate tax revenue fell by 40 percent due to the lower rate and more generous expensing. Second, firms with larger declines in their effective tax wedge increased investment relatively more. In aggregate, we suggest a loose consensus from the literature that total tangible corporate investment increased by 11 percent. Third, the business tax provisions increased economic growth and wages by less than advertised by the Act’s proponents, with long-run GDP higher by less than 1% and labor income by less than $1,000 per employee. Fourth, provisions that increase foreign investment by US-based multinationals also boost their domestic operations. Fifth, some of the expired and expiring provisions, such as accelerated depreciation, generate more investment per dollar of tax revenue than others.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32672,32672,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
The Economics of Biodiversity Loss,"Stefano Giglio, Theresa Kuchler, Johannes Stroebel & Olivier Wang","We explore the economic effects of biodiversity loss by developing an ecologically-founded model that captures how different species interact to deliver the ecosystem services that complement other factors of economic production. Aggregate ecosystem services are produced by combining several non-substitutable ecosystem functions such as pollination and water filtration, which are each provided by many substitutable species playing similar roles. As a result, economic output is an increasing but highly concave function of species richness. The marginal economic value of a species depends on three factors: (i) the number of similar species within its ecosystem function, (ii) the marginal importance of the affected function for overall ecosystem productivity, and (iii) the extent to which ecosystem services constrain economic output in each country. Using our framework, we derive expressions for the fragility of ecosystem service provision and its evolution over time, which depends, among other things, on the distribution of biodiversity losses across ecosystem functions. We discuss how these fragility measures can help policymakers assess the risks induced by biodiversity loss and prioritize conservation efforts. We also embed our model of ecosystem service production in a standard economic model to study optimal land use when land use raises output at the cost of reducing biodiversity. We find that even in settings where species loss does not reduce output substantially today, it lowers growth opportunities and reduces resilience to future species loss, especially when past species loss has been asymmetric across functions. Consistent with these predictions of our model, we show empirically that news about biodiversity loss increases spreads on credit default swaps (CDS) more for countries with more depleted ecosystems.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32678,32678,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Spillovers in Public Benefit Enrollment: How does Expanding Public Health Insurance for Working-Age Adults affect Future Health Insurance Choices?,"M. Kate Bundorf, Melissa McInerney, Kosali I. Simon & Ruth Winecoff","Enrollment in one public benefit program often affects enrollment in others. We study life-course spillovers by examining how access to publicly subsidized health insurance prior to age 65 affects public benefit choices at the age of Medicare eligibility. We use administrative data to examine several Medicare enrollment choices: the heavily under-subscribed Medicaid “dual” coverage as a supplement to Medicare; Medicare Part D; the Part D Low Income Subsidy (LIS); and Medicare Advantage. Focusing on people living in low-income zip codes, we find a large increase in dual Medicaid among new Medicare beneficiaries in Medicaid expansion states relative to non- expansion states, as well as corresponding increases in healthcare use and reductions in out-of-pocket spending. The dual Medicaid increase exerts a bonus effect: greater take-up of LIS and Part D programs, which we attribute to the accompanying automatic enrollment in these programs. Our results on Medicare Advantage enrollment are inconclusive. Overall, our results suggest that experience with Medicaid before age 65 causes meaningful behavioral responses among the lowest-income beneficiaries when they age into Medicare; this emphasizes the importance of longitudinal spillovers also present in other public programs with eligibility criteria that differ by applicant age (e.g., Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32675,32675,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Intertemporal Choice Bracketing and the Measurement of Time Preferences,"Yonas Alem, John Loeser & Aprajit Mahajan","The implications of commonly used money earlier or later (MEL) games for intertemporal behavior depend critically upon subjects’ choice bracketing. If subjects bracket narrowly, responses reflect preferences independent of subjects’ financial environment. Alternatively, if subjects bracket broadly, responses reflect subjects’ marginal returns to investment. We test both hypotheses in a lab-in-the-field experiment, which involves repeated MEL games, a large unconditional cash transfer, and an illiquid savings product. Subjects do not narrowly bracket – randomized cash transfers induce greater patience in MEL choices. Subjects do not broadly bracket either – they fail to arbitrage across equivalent MEL and savings opportunities. We develop a conceptual framework and present evidence that narrowly bracketing subjects drive the predictive power of MEL outcomes for financial choices, providing a rationale for the common practice of interpreting MEL choices as a proxy for time preferences rather than financial environment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32683,32683,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Race and Ethnicity (Mis)measurement in the U.S. Criminal Justice System,"Keith Finlay, Elizabeth Luh & Michael G. Mueller-Smith","The United States criminal justice system is characterized by substantial disparities in outcomes across racial and ethnic groups. Understanding these disparities requires accurate measures of race and ethnicity of people involved in the justice system. We document how race and ethnicity are recorded by administrative agents and how operational concerns limit corrections to misreported race and ethnicity. To understand the impacts of these administrative processes, this paper uses novel linkages between person-level microdata from the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS) and race and ethnicity composites from U.S. Census Bureau census and administrative records, mostly composed of self-reported or family-reported race/ethnicity, to quantify mismeasurement of race and ethnicity in the justice system. We find that 17 percent of misdemeanor and felony defendants and 10 percent of prison inmates have an agency-recorded label that does not concord with the composite measure, largely driven by justice agencies poorly measuring people identified in Census Bureau data as Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander, or American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN). Using estimated correspondences between agency-recorded and the composite race and ethnicity, we reweight federal series on imprisonment rates and show that those series, which currently rely on small survey samples to impute racial and ethnic population shares, have substantially underestimated the incarceration rates of Whites, Blacks, and AIANs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32657,32657,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
"Learning, Catastrophic Risk and Ambiguity in the Climate Change Era",Frances C. Moore,"Key methodologies used for managing weather risks have relied on the assumption that climate is not changing and that the historic weather record is therefore representative of current risks. Anthropogenic climate change upends this assumption, effectively reducing the information available to actors and increasing ambiguity in the estimated climate distribution, with associated costs for weather risk management and risk-averse decision-makers. These costs result purely from the knowledge that the climate could be changing, may arise abruptly, are additional to any direct costs or benefits from actual climate change, and are, to date, entirely unquantified. Using a case study of extreme rainfall-related flood damages in New York City, this paper illustrates how these ambiguity-related costs arise. Greater uncertainty over the current climate distribution interacts with a steeply non-linear damage function to greatly increase the mean and variance of the posterior loss distribution. This is a systemic information shock that cannot be diversified within the insurance sector, producing higher and more volatile premiums and higher reinsurance costs. These effects are consistent with recent developments in US property insurance markets, where premium increases, bankruptcies, and insurer withdrawals have been linked to the growing costs of natural disasters.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32684,32684,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Aggregate Shocks and the Formation of Preferences and Beliefs,Paola Giuliano & Antonio Spilimbergo,"A growing body of work has shown that aggregate shocks affect the formation of preferences and beliefs. This article reviews evidence from sociology, social psychology, and economics to assess the relevance of aggregate shocks, whether the period in which they are experienced matters, and whether they alter preferences and beliefs permanently. We review the literature on recessions, inflation experiences, trade shocks, and aggregate non-economic shocks including migrations, wars, terrorist attacks, pandemics, and natural disasters. For each aggregate shock, we discuss the main empirical methodologies, their limitations, and their comparability across studies, outlining possible mechanisms whenever available. A few conclusions emerge consistently across the reviewed papers. First, aggregate shocks impact many preferences and beliefs, including political preferences, risk attitudes, and trust in institutions. Second, the effect of shocks experienced during young adulthood is stronger and longer lasting. Third, negative aggregate economic shocks generally move preferences and beliefs to the right of the political spectrum, while the effects of non-economic adverse shocks are more heterogeneous and depend on the context.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32669,32669,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
"The Distributional Effects of U.S. Tax Credits for Heat Pumps, Solar Panels, and Electric Vehicles",Severin Borenstein & Lucas W. Davis,"Over the last two decades, U.S. households have received $47 billion in tax credits for buying heat pumps, solar panels, electric vehicles, and other “clean energy” technologies. Using information from tax returns, we show that these tax credits have gone predominantly to higher-income households. The bottom three income quintiles have received about 10% of all credits, while the top quintile has received about 60%. The most extreme is the tax credit for electric vehicles, for which the top quintile has received more than 80% of all credits. The concentration of tax credits among high-income filers is relatively constant over time, though we do find a slight broadening for the electric vehicle credit since 2018. The paper then turns to the related question of cost effectiveness, examining how clean energy technology adoption has changed over time and discussing some of the broader economic considerations for this type of tax credit.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32688,32688,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024

Lessons from History for Successful Disinflation,Christina D. Romer & David H. Romer,"Why do some attempts at disinflation lead to substantial reductions in inflation while others do not? We investigate this question in the context of the Federal Reserve’s attempts at disinflation since World War II. Our central finding is that a fundamental determinant of success in reducing inflation was the strength of the Federal Reserve’s commitment to disinflation at the start of its attempts. In episodes where its commitment was high, there were significant declines in inflation that were often long-lasting, while in ones where its commitment was low, falls in inflation were at most small and short-lived. We find that although the extent of the Federal Reserve’s commitment was often clear to the public, there is no evidence that stronger commitment to disinflation directly affected expected inflation. Rather, the main channel through which weak commitment led to unsuccessful disinflation was premature abandonment of the disinflationary policy. We conclude by discussing the implications for the Federal Reserve’s current effort at disinflation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32666,32666,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Dynamic Price Competition with Capacity Constraints,"Jose M. Betancourt, Ali Hortaçsu, Aniko Öry & Kevin R. Williams","We study dynamic price competition between sellers offering differentiated products with limited capacity and a common sales deadline. In every period, firms simultaneously set prices, and a randomly arriving buyer decides whether to purchase a product or leave the market. Given remaining capacities, firms trade off selling today against shifting demand to competitors to obtain future market power. We provide conditions for the existence and uniqueness of pure-strategy Markov perfect equilibria. In the continuous-time limit, prices solve a system of ordinary differential equations. We derive properties of equilibrium dynamics and show that prices increase the most when the product with the lowest remaining capacity sells. Because firms do not fully internalize the social option value of future sales, equilibrium prices can be inefficiently low such that both firms and consumers would benefit if firms could commit to higher prices. We term this new welfare effect the Bertrand scarcity trap.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32673,32673,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Innovation Spillovers across U.S. Tech Clusters,"Xavier Giroud, Ernest Liu & Holger Mueller","The vast majority of U.S. inventors work for firms that also have inventors and plants in other tech clusters. Using merged USPTO–U.S. Census Bureau plant-level data, we show that larger tech clusters not only make local inventors more productive but also raise the productivity of inventors and plants in other clusters, which are connected to the focal cluster through their parent firms' networks of innovating plants. Cross-cluster innovation spillovers do not depend on the physical distance between clusters, and plants cite disproportionately more patents from other firms in connected clusters, across large physical distances. To rationalize these findings, and to inform policy, we develop a tractable model of spatial innovation that features both within- and cross-cluster innovation spillovers. Based on our model, we derive a sufficient statistic for the wedge between the social and private returns to innovation in a given location. Taking the model to the data, we rank all U.S. tech clusters according to this wedge. While larger tech clusters exhibit a greater social-private innovation wedge, this is not because of local knowledge spillovers, but because they are well-connected to other clusters through firms' networks of innovating plants. In counterfactual exercises, we show that an increase in the interconnectedness of U.S. tech clusters raises the social-private innovation wedge in (almost) all locations, but especially in tech clusters that are large and well-connected to other clusters.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32677,32677,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024

Furthermore, the differences between the two vary systematically according to investor characteristics. We use information treatments in the RCT to create exogenous differential variations in first- and higher-order beliefs. We find that an exogenous increase in first-order beliefs increases the portfolio share allocated to the stock market (risky assets), while an exogenous increase in higher-order beliefs reduces it.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32680,32680,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Implementing a Ramsey Plan,"Wei Jiang, Thomas J.

We show how a Ramsey plan can always be implemented by adding instantaneous debt to Lucas and Stokey’s contractible subspace and requiring that each continuation government preserve that debt’s purchasing power instantaneously. We formulate the Ramsey problem with a Bellman equation and use it to study settings with various initial term debt structures and government spending processes.

"Automation, Career Values, and Political Preferences","Maria Petrova, Gregor Schubert, Bledi Taska & Pinar Yildirim","Career opportunities and expectations shape people’s decisions and can diminish over time. In this paper, we study the career implications of automation and robotization using a novel data set of resumes from approximately 16 million individuals from the United States. We calculate the lifetime ""career value"" of various occupations, combining (1) the likelihood of future transitions to other occupations, and (2) the earning potential of these occupations. We first document a downward trend in the growth of career values in the U.S. between 2000 and 2016. While wage growth slows down over this time period, the decline in the average career value growth is mainly due to reduced upward occupational mobility. We find that robotization contributes to the decline of average local labor market career values. One additional robot per 1000 workers decreased the average local market career value by $3.9K between 2004 and 2008 and by $2.48K between 2008 and 2016, corresponding to 1.7% and 1.1% of the average career values from the year 2000. In commuting zones that have been more exposed to robots, the average career value has declined further between 2000 and 2016. This decline was more pronounced for low-skilled individuals, with a substantial part of the decline coming from their reduced upward mobility. We document that other sources of mobility mitigate the negative effects of automation on career values. We also show that the changes in career values are predictive of investment in long-term outcomes, such as investment into schooling and housing, and voting for a populist candidate, as proxied by the vote share of Trump in 2016. We also find further evidence that automation affected both the demand side and supply side of politics.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32655,32655,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Do Reforms Aimed at Reducing Time to Graduation Work? Evidence from the Italian Higher Education System,"Davide Malacrino, Samuel Nocito & Raffaele Saggio","This paper examines the impact of a reform aimed at expediting graduation times in Italian universities by reducing the number of exams students must pass to obtain a fixed number of credits. Using event-study estimates that leverage the reform's staggered implementation, we find that this policy change led to an increase in on-time graduation rates. However, it also resulted in a decreased probability of employment one-year post-graduation.

Redesigning Payments for Ecosystem Services to Increase Cost-Effectiveness,"Santiago Izquierdo-Tort, Seema Jayachandran & Santiago Saavedra","Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are a widely used approach for forest conservation through which people are paid to avoid deforesting land they enroll in the program. We present findings from a randomized trial in Mexico that tested whether a PES contract that requires enrollees to enroll all of their forest is more effective than the traditional PES contract that allows them to exercise choice. The modification's aim is to prevent landowners from enrolling only parcels they planned to conserve anyway while leaving aside other parcels to deforest. We find that the full-enrollment treatment reduces deforestation by 41% compared to the traditional contract. This extra conservation occurs despite the full-enrollment provision reducing the compliance rate due to its more stringent requirements. The full-enrollment treatment more than quadrupled cost-effectiveness, highlighting the potential to substantially improve the efficacy of conservation payments through simple contract modifications.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32689,32689,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Webmunk: A New Tool for Studying Online Behavior and Digital Platforms,"Chiara Farronato, Andrey Fradkin & Chris Karr","Understanding the behavior of users online is important for researchers, policymakers, and private companies alike. But observing online behavior and conducting experiments is difficult without direct access to the user base and software of technology companies. We introduce Webmunk, an open-source tool designed to make conducting online studies much easier. The user-facing side of Webmunk is a browser extension that can track consumer browsing behavior and experimentally modify consumers experiences as they browse the Internet. It can be installed just like any other browser extension, such as ad blockers. Through this extension, researchers can collect a host of consumer data, from URLs to web page HTML elements, clicks, and scroll positions. The extension can also modify information and change the look of a web page, allowing for researchers to implement interventions that vary across study participants. A key advantage of this approach is that interventions occur while participants are engaging in real world activities such as shopping, browsing the news, using social media, or searching for information. We demonstrate the power of Webmunk by discussing two studies in progress.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32694,32694,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Local Administration and Racial Inequality in Federal Program Access: Insights from New Deal Work Relief,"Price V. Fishback, Jessamyn Schaller & Evan J.

However, eligibility was determined by local and state administrators. We estimate Black-white gaps in work relief access separately by county. The results show that about 40 percent of Blacks resided in counties with equal or better access than similar whites. Access for Black men was much worse in the South. We find that Black access was better in areas where Black and white workers were complementary and where more public and private resources were available.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32681,32681,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
Search and Biased Beliefs in Education Markets,"Patrick Agte, Claudia Allende, Adam Kapor, Christopher Neilson & Fernando Ochoa","This paper asks how search costs, limited awareness of schools, misperceptions of schools’ attributes, and inaccurate beliefs over unknown schools affect families’ search and application decisions in Chile’s nation wide school choice process. We combine novel data on search activity with a panel of household surveys, administrative application data, randomized information experiments, and a model of demand and sequential search with subjective beliefs. Descriptively, households hold inaccurate beliefs and misperceptions along multiple dimensions which distort the perceived returns to search. Most importantly, they do not know all schools, and misperceive quality ratings of the schools they know and like. Improving the search technology would raise households’ search effort and welfare. Correcting misperceptions about known schools’ observables would cause students to match to schools with higher quality, equal to what can be achieved under a full-information benchmark. Models with out misperceptions would incorrectly predict quality reductions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32670,32670,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
How will Generative AI impact Communication?,Joshua S. Gans,"This paper examines the impact of Generative AI (GAI) on communication through the lens of salience and signalling models. It explores how GAI affects both senders' ability to create salient messages and receivers' costs of absorbing them. The analysis reveals that while GAI can increase communication by reducing costs, it may also disrupt traditional signalling mechanisms. In a salience model, GAI generally improves outcomes but can potentially reduce receiver welfare. In a pure signalling model, GAI may hinder effective communication by making it harder to distinguish high-quality messages. This suggests that GAI's introduction necessitates new instruments and mechanisms to facilitate effective communication and quality assessment in this evolving landscape.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32690,32690,24-Jul,NBER,7/15/2024
An Empirical Analysis of the Cost of Borrowing,"Miguel Faria e Castro, Samuel Jordan-Wood, and Julian Kozlowski","We examine borrowing costs for firms using a security-level database with bank loans and corporate bonds issued by U.S. companies. We find significant within-firm dispersion in borrowing rates, even after controlling for security and firm observable characteristics. Obtaining a bank loan is 132 basis points cheaper than issuing a bond, after accounting for observable factors. Changes in borrowing costs have persistent negative impacts on firm-level outcomes, such as investment and borrowing, and these effects vary across sectors.

Targeted Relief: Geography and Timing of Emergency Rental Assistance,"Theodore F. Figinski, Sydney Keenan, Richard Sweeney, and Erin Troland","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress established the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program, which provided nearly $45 billion to prevent evictions and increase housing stability. We provide new evidence on the implementation of ERA by examining the fine-grained geographic distribution of ERA funds and the timing of ERA expenditures by state and local governments. Using administrative data on ERA transactions, we find that ERA sent more funds per renting household to census tracts with higher pre-pandemic eviction filing rates, higher poverty rates, higher shares of Black renters, higher shares of renting households with children, and higher shares of renting single mothers. Our results suggest that ERA was largely successful in reaching communities that were most likely to have the highest risk of eviction. We also document that ERA spending increased substantially around the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium and at a time when eviction filings were increasing, which may confound quasi-experimental analysis of ERA.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/targeted-relief-geography-and-timing-of-emergency-rental-assistance.htm,2024-055,24-Jul,FED-BOARD,7/17/2024

We quantify the impact of Japan's low-rate policies on its government and households. Because of the duration mismatch on the government balance sheet, the government's fiscal space expands when real rates decline, allowing the government to keep its promises to older Japanese households. A typical younger Japanese household does not have enough duration in its portfolio to continue to finance its spending plan and will be worse off.

Unequal Climate Policy in an Unequal World,"Elisa Belfiori, Daniel Carroll and Sewon Hur","We study climate policy in an economy with heterogeneous households, two types of goods (clean and dirty), and a climate externality from the dirty good. Using household expenditure and emissions data, we document that low-income households have higher emissions per dollar spent than high-income households, making a carbon tax regressive. We build a model that captures this fact and study climate policies that are neutral with respect to the income distribution. A central feature of these policies is that resource transfers across consumers are ruled out. We show that the constrained optimal carbon tax in a heterogeneous economy is heterogeneous: Higher-income households face a higher rate. Our main result shows that when the planner is limited to a uniform carbon tax, the tax follows the Pigouvian rule but is lower than the unconstrained carbon tax. Finally, we embed this model into a standard incomplete markets framework to quantify the policy effects on the economy, climate and welfare, and we find a Pareto-improving result.

The Countercyclical Benefits of Regulatory Costs,Alexander Mechanick and Jacob P. Weber,"Legal academics, journalists, and senior executive branch officials alike have assumed that the cost of imposing new regulatory requirements is higher in severe recessions that drive the central bank’s policy rate to zero than in other times. This is not correct; the aggregate output costs of regulatory requirements decrease, not increase, in such recessions. This article is the first to analyze how this effect arises, drawing on both conventional macroeconomic models and empirical findings from the econometrics literature. Scholars and policymakers have likely missed the countercyclical benefits of regulatory costs because of informal, ad hoc macroeconomic assumptions embedded in regulatory analysis.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1109,1109,7/17/2024,FED-NEWYORK,7/19/2024
Measuring capital at risk with financial contagion: two-sector model with banks and insurers,Giovanni Covi and Anne-Caroline Huser,"How do interdependent economic shocks impact the financial system and reverberate within it? To model the financial system, we start with a two-sector microstructural model of the financial system that includes banks and insurers. We develop a stress testing methodology that stochastically computes economic profits and losses at banks and insurers following correlated corporate default shocks. Taking into account the feedback and amplification of the initial shock though the financial system, we quantify its impact on firms’ capital positions. This methodology is applied to a very rich panel data set of UK banks and insurers. Our approach enables us to distil the contribution of initial economic shocks and the feedback and amplification mechanisms to extreme tail events. Overall, we find that, since the Covid pandemic (2020–21), the UK financial system has experienced an improvement in both profit expectations and tail losses. Comparing sectoral losses in an extreme stress scenario, we find that insurers are more affected than banks by economic credit and traded risk losses, while fire sale losses affect banks more than insurers.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/measuring-capital-at-risk-with-financial-contagion-two-sector-model-with-banks-and-insurers,1081,"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 ",BOE,7/19/2024
The Effect of Primary Dealer Constraints on Intermediation in the Treasury Market ,"Falk Bräuning, Hillary Stein","Using confidential microdata, we show that shocks to primary dealers’ risk-bearing constraints have significant effects on the US Treasury securities market. In response to tighter constraints, dealers reduce their Treasury positions, triggering a reduction in aggregate turnover and an increase in bid–ask spreads. These effects are more pronounced in securities that contribute more to the utilization of risk constraints. The impaired intermediation also affects Treasury yields, amplifying the yield response to net demand shifts. Moreover, tighter dealer constraints weaken Treasury auction outcomes: Bid-to-cover ratios decline, driven by dealers’ less aggressive bidding, and the highest yield accepted by participants rises, thereby increasing the government’s cost of issuing debt. Using our estimates, we back out key elasticities to show that the shadow cost of dealer constraints is as high as one-third of dealers’ intermediation margin.",https://www.bostonfed.org//publications/research-department-working-paper/2024/the-effect-of-primary-dealer-constraints-on-intermediation-in-the-treasury-market,24-7,7/17/2024,FED-BOSTON,7/19/2024

CPI inflation perceptions respond very quickly, in a matter of hours after the release. We also find that firms’ expected own-price growth has a strong positive correlation with changes in CPI inflation, particularly for increases in inflation. This sensitivity is stronger when inflation is high. Firms are also more responsive when inflation coverage in the media is elevated and appear to have had a supply-side view of the economy since 2022: higher aggregate inflation leads to lower expected sales volume growth and higher expected cost growth.

Analyzing more than half of the auto loans originated during the past 16 years, we find that longer-maturity new car loans have significantly higher interest rates with a yield curve much steeper than comparable-maturity Treasury securities. In addition, we show that the majority of auto loans were prepaid, including loans of zero interest, and that many prepaying borrowers could have paid materially less interest by choosing loans of a shorter maturity.

Balance-Sheet Netting in U.S. Treasury Markets and Central Clearing,"David Bowman, Yesol Huh, and Sebastian Infante","In this paper, we provide a comprehensive investigation of the potential for expanded central clearing to reduce the costs of the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) on Treasury market intermediation in both cash and repo markets. Combining a detailed analysis of the rules involved in calculating the SLR with a unique set of regulatory data, we conclude that expanding central clearing would have relatively limited effects on the level of SLRs. We do find intermediaries’ increase their balance sheet netting when their regulatory balance sheet costs are higher. Our data permits us to establish a number of empirical facts related to the noncentrally cleared bilateral (NCCB) repo segment, and to repo activity overall, at the bank holding company level. We find that sizeable amounts of bilaterally-cleared activity would not be nettable even if centrally cleared. We also find that a significant portion of activity is already nettable outside of central clearing because dealers are structuring their NCCB trades to net. While expanded central clearing could have other benefits, such as imposing a more uniform margin regime on Treasury market intermediation, the scope of its effects on reducing balance sheet costs associated with the leverage ratio is limited.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/balance-sheet-netting-in-us-treasury-markets-and-central-clearing.htm,2024-057,24-Jul,FED-BOARD,7/19/2024
Collateral demand in wholesale funding markets,"Jamie Coen, Patrick Coen and Anne-Caroline Hüser","Repo markets are systemically important funding markets, but are also used by firms to obtain the assets provided as collateral. Do these two functions complement each other? We build and estimate a model of repo trade between heterogeneous firms, and find that the answer is no: volumes and gains to trade would both be higher absent collateral demand. This is because on average the firms that need funding are also those that value the collateral to speculate or hedge interest rate risk.

The impact of aggregate fluctuations across the UK income distribution,Tomas Key and Jamie Lenney,"In this paper, we examine the response of earnings and employment to fluctuations in aggregate economic activity (GDP) across the income distribution. Using data from the UK’s Labour Force Survey, we present evidence that aggregate fluctuations have economically significant but heterogeneous impacts across the income distribution. Sensitivity is greatest at the very bottom (first decile) of the income distribution and smallest in the upper middle (seventh and eight deciles) of the distribution. The transmission of GDP fluctuations also differs across the income distribution. Changes to hours worked and employment explain the majority of the labour earnings response in the bottom half of the distribution, whereas changes to the hourly wage are more important in the top half. In a further decomposition, we show that the changes to employment are largely due to fluctuations in the employment to unemployment transition rate. We also find that GDP fluctuations are positively correlated with job switching in the bottom half of the distribution.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/the-impact-of-aggregate-fluctuations-across-the-uk-income-distribution,1083,"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 ",BOE,7/19/2024

From Adoption to Innovation: State-Dependent Technology Policy in Developing Countries,Jaedo Choi ; Younghun Shim,"Should policymakers in developing countries prioritize foreign technology adoption over domestic innovation?

Furthermore, non-adopters increased patent citations to foreign sellers, suggesting knowledge spillovers. Motivated by these findings, we build a two-country growth model with innovation and adoption. As the gaps narrow, productivity gains and spillovers from adoption diminish and foreign sellers strategically raise fees due to intensified competition, which renders adoption subsidies less effective.

Snow Belt to Sun Belt Migration: End of an Era?,"Sylvain Leduc, Daniel Wilson","Internal migration has been cited as a key channel by which societies will adapt to climate change. We show in this paper that this process has already been happening in the United States. Over the course of the past 50 years, the tendency of Americans to move from the coldest places (“snow belt”), which have become warmer, to the hottest places (“sun belt”), which have become hotter, has steadily declined. In the latest full decade, 2010-2020, both county population growth and county net migration rates were essentially uncorrelated with the historical means of either extreme heat days or extreme cold days. The decline in these correlations over the past 50 years is true across counties, across commuting zones, and across states. It holds for urban and suburban counties; for rural counties the correlations have even reversed. It holds for all educational groups, with the sharpest decline in correlations for those with four or more years of college. Among age groups, the pattern is strongest for age groups 20-29 and 60-69, suggestive of climate being an especially important factor for those in life stages involving long-term location choices. Given climate change projections for coming decades of increasing extreme heat in the hottest U.S. counties and decreasing extreme cold in the coldest counties, our findings suggest the “pivoting” in the U.S. climate-migration correlation over the past 50 years is likely to continue, leading to a reversal of the 20th century snow belt to sun belt migration pattern.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/07/snow-belt-to-sun-belt-migration-end-of-an-era,2024-21,7/18/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,7/20/2024

Using 2000-2021 data for 76 economies and a simple methodology, we find that each respective series’ common factor and conventional US GFCy-drivers together typically explain about 30 percent of the variation in domestic credit, up to 40 percent in stock market returns, about 60 percent in house prices, and more than 75 percent in interest rates and government bond spreads. These median estimates much exceed the 25 percent for capital flows. Our findings help to put the existing literature into context and have important implications for economic and financial stability policies, notably for the usage of quantity tools (e.g., FX interventions) that impact asset prices.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/07/19/The-Global-Financial-Cycle-Quantities-versus-Prices-552069,2024-158,"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 ",IMF,7/20/2024
Policy Options for Climate Mitigation: Emissions Trading Schemes in Asia-Pacific,Margaux MacDonald ; Ian W.H. Parry,"Large reductions in global emissions are needed for the world to be on track to meet global temperature goals. Asia-Pacific countries have a critical role in emissions reduction given their large and rising share in global emissions. This paper discusses the main opportunities and behavioral responses for reducing emissions, and commonly used mitigation instruments. It then considers key design issues for carbon pricing, with a focus on emissions trading schemes (ETS), describes measures to overcome the obstacles to carbon pricing, and discusses experiences with carbon pricing relevant for Asia-Pacific economies. Lastly, the paper covers complementary policy reforms, including reinforcing mitigation instruments, public investment, fuel tax reform, green industrial policies, and supporting reforms to the energy sector. Carbon pricing, including ETSs can be the centerpiece of climate mitigation strategies for most countries, particularly if ETSs are designed to mimic some of the administrative and economic attractions of carbon taxes and implemented appropriately.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/07/18/Policy-Options-for-Climate-Mitigation-Emissions-Trading-Schemes-in-Asia-Pacific-552110,2024-155,"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 ",IMF,7/20/2024
Insurers' Investments and Insurance Prices,Benjamin Knox and Jakob Ahm Sørensen,"We develop a theory that connects insurance prices, insurance companies’ investment behavior, and equilibrium asset prices. Consistent with the model’s predictions, we show empirically that (1) insurers with more stable insurance funding take more investment risk and, therefore, earn higher average investment returns; (2) insurers set lower prices on policies when expected investment returns are higher, both in the cross-section of insurance companies and in the time series. Our results hold for both life insurance and property and casualty insurance companies. The findings show that insurers’ asset allocation and product pricing decisions are more connected than previously thought.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/insurers-investments-and-insurance-prices.htm,2024-058,24-Jul,FED-BOARD,7/20/2024
Diverse Paths to College Success: The Impact of Massachusetts' Urban and Nonurban Charter Schools on College Trajectories,Sarah Cohodes & Astrid Pineda,"The charter school movement encompasses many school models. In Massachusetts in the 2010's, the site of our study, urban charter schools primarily used ""No Excuses"" practices, whereas nonurban charters had greater model variety. Using randomized admissions lotteries, we estimate the impact of charter schools by locality on college preparation, enrollment, and graduation. Urban charter schools boost all of these outcomes. Nonurban charter schools raise college enrollment and graduation despite reducing state test scores and AP enrollment. Our results suggest that there is more than one path to a college degree and that test score impacts may not predict college outcomes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32732,32732,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Moral Hazard and Unemployment in Competitive Equilibrium,Patrick Rey & Joseph E. Stiglitz,"Principal-agent models take outside options, determining participation and incentive constraints, as given. We construct a general equilibrium model where workers’ reservation wages and the maximum punishment acceptable before workers quit are instead determined endogenously. We simultaneously extend the standard effort efficiency-wage model by incorporating noisy signals, labor market frictions, and the possibility of performance-based pay, analyzing the equilibrium response to an adverse signal, and establishing conditions under which equilibrium entails lowering wages (performance contracting) rather than firing. We provide a complete analysis of the general equilibrium comparative statics, showing, for instance, that frictions (sand-in-the-wheels) may decrease unemployment and that the equilibrium is determined by two simple aggregates which depend on the parameters of the economy, interpretable as the intercept and slope of a pseudo-labor supply curve, embedding all the binding constraints (e.g., the no-shirking and labor market participation constraints). We also show that there may exist only a firing equilibrium, a no-firing equilibrium, multiple (firing and no-firing) equilibria, and no pure-strategy equilibrium. The economy is, in general, not efficient either in the selection of the form of equilibrium or the wages paid within any type of equilibrium. We discuss welfare enhancing government interventions, including publicly provided sand-in-the-wheels.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32700,32700,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Driving Towards Integration: Early Childhood Education Implications of Extending Driving Privileges to Undocumented Immigrants,"Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes, Monica Deza, Genti Kostandini & Tianyuan Luo","We estimate the effect of granting access to driver licenses to undocumented immigrants on their offspring’s access to early childhood education (ECE). Using individual-level data from the ACS, we find that granting driving privileges to undocumented immigrants leads to a 6% increase in ECE attendance among Hispanic children with likely undocumented parents. We explore potential mechanisms and find that these laws enhance mobility, driving autonomy, and English proficiency among likely undocumented immigrants. These laws also increase hourly wages among likely undocumented mothers, which may increase their bargaining power and financial resources. The findings highlight the positive externalities of extending driving privileges to undocumented immigrants.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32723,32723,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
The Speed of Firm Response to Inflation,"Ivan Yotzov, Nicholas Bloom, Philip Bunn, Paul Mizen & Gregory Thwaites","This paper analyses the response of firms to monthly CPI inflation releases using high-frequency data from a large economy-wide business survey. CPI inflation perceptions respond very quickly, in a matter of hours after the release. We also find that firms’ expected own-price growth has a strong positive correlation with changes in CPI inflation, particularly for increases in inflation. This sensitivity is stronger when inflation is high. Firms are also more responsive when inflation coverage in the media is elevated and appear to have had a supply-side view of the economy since 2022: higher aggregate inflation leads to lower expected sales volume growth and higher expected cost growth. Firms also seem to anticipate the monetary policy response, as positive inflation changes are associated with higher expected borrowing rates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32731,32731,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Subjective Income Expectations and Household Debt Cycles,"Francesco D’Acunto, Michael Weber & Xiao Yin","Matched transaction-level, credit-registry, and survey-based data reveal that consumers on average form excessively high (low) income expectations relative to ex-post realizations after unexpected positive (negative) income shocks. These extrapolative income expectations lead consumers to increase current spending, accumulate more debt, and face more defaults when lower-than-expected incomes are realized. We assess the aggregate implications by estimating a consumption model with defaultable unsecured debt and diagnostic Kalman filtering whereby consumers over-extrapolate income shocks when forming expectations. Extrapolative income expectations help explain state-dependent household debt cycles qualitatively and quantitatively.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32715,32715,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
An Engine of (Pay) Growth? Productivity and Wages in the UK Auto Industry,"Agnes Norris Keiller, Tim Obermeier, Andreas Teichgraeber & John Van Reenen","When labour market competition is imperfect, positive industry (and firm) productivity shocks can be passed through to workers in the form of higher wages. We document how the UK auto industry, following a period of decline, experienced a four-decade-long productivity boom. There was a thirteen-fold increase in real output per worker between 1980 and 2018, compared to a four-fold increase in manufacturing. Greater foreign ownership, tougher competition and improved industrial relations all likely played a role. The greater use of intermediate inputs (outsourcing) and growing capital intensity account for most of this growth, but we estimate that TFP still grew three times as fast in the auto industry than the rest of manufacturing. Examining whether this productivity increase has been shared with employees, we find that auto workers experienced far stronger hourly wage growth than workers in the rest of manufacturing. After controlling for individual fixed effects, the auto wage premium relative to the rest of manufacturing doubled from 8% in the 1980s to 17% in the 2010s. Interpreted through the lens of a rent sharing model, we estimate that most of the wage increase (63% in the baseline case) can be accounted for by the auto productivity boom. In contrast, the bargaining power of UK auto workers seems to have fallen. If worker power had held up at the 1980s level, the wage premium would have been about 38% higher in the 2010s.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32695,32695,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Is Maturity-Transformation Risk Priced into Bank Deposit Rates?,Matthias Fleckenstein & Francis A. Longstaff,"We use the term structure of bank CD rates to examine whether maturity-transformation risk is priced into the rates banks offer customers. We find that depositors pay a significant cost for the liquidity provided by bank deposits. This cost is strongly related to the amount of maturity-transformation risk that these deposit accounts create. The cost is also negatively correlated with the convenience premia in Treasury markets, which suggests that households do not view deposit liquidity and Treasury liquidity as perfect substitutes. The results have important implications about the role of deposit franchises and market power in banking markets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32724,32724,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
The Shifting Finance of Electricity Generation,Aleksandar Andonov & Joshua Rauh,"Despite the incentives of incumbent domestic listed corporations (DLCs) in the electricity generation industry, private equity, institutional investors, and foreign corporations have played an outsized role in financing the energy transition. These new entrants are twice as likely to create power plants as incumbents. They owned 58% of wind, 47% of solar, and 34% of natural gas electricity production as of 2020. The ownership changes are concentrated in deregulated wholesale markets which attract more capital from new entrants to create renewable and natural gas plants, acquire existing plants, and accelerate the decommissioning of coal plants. Sales of fossil fuel plants from DLCs to foreign corporations result in some leakage, but private equity has similar decommissioning rates to incumbents. The new ownership types create more efficient power plants with a lower heat rate and improve the efficiency of acquired plants. Our results also highlight an important tradeoff in bringing new financing sources to the electricity sector. When selling electricity, private equity and foreign corporations use contracts with shorter duration, shorter increment pricing, and more peak-period sales, and obtain a $2.59 higher average price per MWh.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32733,32733,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Don’t Throw the Baby Out With the Bathwater: Firm Response to Downstream Product Shocks,"Phares Akari, Chirantan Chatterjee & Matthew J. Higgins","We explore how firms respond to downstream product shocks. We find that affected firms increase R&D and make additional safety-related investments in their existing assets-in-place. These investments vary with firm capabilities and across shock severity. Competitors appear to vicariously learn and also engage in similar upstream investments. We present evidence that these upstream investments have important performance implications. First, these investments are positively related to transition probabilities and approval rates for products that received them. Second, these investments are related to a decrease in the intensity and rate of future downstream product shocks. Surprisingly, however, these investments appear to have limited impact on mitigating the negative demand response caused by these shocks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32703,32703,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
"Extreme Events, Educational Aspirations and Long-term Outcomes","Rene A. Iwo, Elizabeth Frankenberg, Cecep Sumantri & Duncan Thomas","The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was an extremely destructive event in Aceh, Indonesia, killing over 160,000 people and destroying infrastructure, homes, and livelihoods over miles of coastline. In its immediate aftermath, affected populations faced a daunting array of challenges. At the population level, questions of how the disaster affected children’s and parents’ aspirations for education and whether it permanently disrupted schooling progression are critical in understanding how shocks affect human capital in the short and long term. We use longitudinal data from the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR) to examine how disaster exposure affects educational aspirations and eventual attainment. We find that damage to one’s community depresses aspirations in the short term but that this weakens with time. With respect to educational attainment 15 years after the event, children’s aspirations, parents’ education, and family socioeconomic status are more important determinants of whether children complete high school and go on to tertiary schooling than disaster exposure. While these results likely reflect, at least in part, the successful post-tsunami reconstruction program, they also establish enormous resilience among survivors who bore the brunt of the tsunami.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32702,32702,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Digital Advertising and Market Structure: Implications for Privacy Regulation,"Daniel Deisenroth, Utsav Manjeer, Zarak Sohail, Steven Tadelis & Nils Wernerfelt","Digital advertising, which uses consumer data to target ads to users, now accounts for most of global ad expenditures. Privacy concerns have prompted regulations that restrict the use of personal data. To inform these policy debates, we develop an equilibrium model of advertising and market structure to analyze the impact of privacy regulation on market outcomes. We test the model’s predictions using the launch of Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature, which created a natural experiment that limited the use of consumer data. Leveraging data from all U.S. advertisers on Meta combined with offline administrative data, we find that reductions in digital ad effectiveness led to decreases in investments in advertising, increases in market concentration, and increases in product prices. These effects are economically meaningful in magnitude and suggest potential harms to both firms and consumers from privacy regulation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32726,32726,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024

The Gas Trap: Outcompeting Coal vs. Renewables,Bård Harstad & Katinka Holtsmark,"We analyze a fundamental dilemma and time-inconsistency problem facing a climate coalition producing natural gas. In the short term, it is tempting to export more to outcompete coal. When this policy is anticipated, however, investments in renewables fall and emissions ultimately increase. When the coalition cannot pre-commit, its policies will be counterproductive. We discuss the robustness of this result and possible solutions. If the coalition can invest directly in renewables, for instance, the incentive to maintain a high price on exports can mitigate the temptation to reduce the price to outcompete coal. Under certain conditions, the commitment outcome can be implemented.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32718,32718,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024

On the Origins of Direct Rule: Armed Groups and Customary Chiefs in Eastern Congo,"Soeren J. Henn, Gauthier Marchais, Christian Mastaki Mugaruka & Raúl Sánchez de la Sierra","Armed groups routinely delegate domains of rule to village customary chiefs—indirect rule. The larger a chief’s power over the villagers relative to the group’s, the more there is indirect rule. Over time, enabled by the chief’s efforts to legitimize the group, the group expands the taxes they collect themselves in addition to those collected by the chief for them and substitutes the chief for justice administration—converging to direct rule. This suggests indirect rule is a temporary arrangement by uninformed or illegitimate rulers with an inherent agency problem, overcome when rulers acquire enough skill to replace pre-existing political authorities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32722,32722,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
How Do You Find a Good Manager?,"Ben Weidmann, Joseph Vecci, Farah Said, David J. Deming & Sonia R.

The method requires repeated random assignment of managers to multiple teams and controls for individuals’ skills. A good manager is someone who consistently causes their team to produce more than the sum of their parts. Good managers have roughly twice the impact on team performance as good workers. People who nominate themselves to be in charge perform worse than managers appointed by lottery, in part because self-promoted managers are overconfident, especially about their social skills. Managerial performance is positively predicted by economic decision-making skill and fluid intelligence – but not gender, age, or ethnicity. Selecting managers on skills rather than demographics or preferences for leadership could substantially increase organizational productivity.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32699,32699,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024

Toward a Holistic Approach to Central Bank Trust,Sandra Eickmeier & Luba Petersen,"We examine public trust in the European Central Bank (ECB) and its determinants using data from the Bundesbank Household Panel survey for Germany. Employing an interdisciplinary approach that integrates insights from political science and psychology, we offer a fresh perspective on the factors influencing central bank trust that is more holistic than the conventional one. Our primary findings can be summarized as follows. Households who state that competence, which we define as the ECB's performance in maintaining stable prices and making decisions grounded in rules, science, and data, matters for their trust in the ECB, tend to express higher trust in the ECB. Conversely, those who place greater importance on values, particularly the integrity of top central bankers, honest communication and broader concern, tend to trust the ECB less. Trust in the ECB also hinges on trust in political institutions more generally and, to a lesser extent, on generalized trust (i.e. trust in others).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32716,32716,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Mispricing Narratives after Social Unrest,"Bocar A. Ba, Abdoulaye Ndiaye, Roman Rivera & Alexander Whitefield","We study how negative sentiment around an industry impacts beliefs and behaviors, focusing on demands for racial justice after the murder of George Floyd and the salience of the “defund the police” movement. We assess stakeholder beliefs on the impact of protests on the stock prices of police-affiliated firms. In our survey experiment, laypeople and finance professionals predicted more negative stock price outcomes when they lacked details on the products supplied by such firms. Exposure to narratives about the context of the protests further reduced the prediction accuracy of these groups. In contrast, product information improved the prediction accuracy of respondents. Turning to real-life behavior, we find that mutual funds exposed to protests were 20% less likely to hold police stocks, after the protests, than funds in areas without protests. Political support for maintaining police funding, though in the majority, declined by 4.3 percentage points in protest areas. The salience of the “defund the police” narrative led to significant overreactions in both financial predictions and real-life behavior.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32730,32730,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Does Income Affect Health? Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial of a Guaranteed Income,"Sarah Miller, Elizabeth Rhodes, Alexander W. Bartik, David E. Broockman, Patrick K. Krause & Eva Vivalt","This paper provides new evidence on the causal relationship between income and health by studying a randomized experiment in which 1,000 low-income adults in the United States received $1,000 per month for three years, with 2,000 control participants receiving $50 over that same period. The cash transfer resulted in large but short-lived improvements in stress and food security, greater use of hospital and emergency department care, and increased medical spending of about $20 per month in the treatment relative to the control group. Our results also suggest that the use of other office-based care—particularly dental care—may have increased as a result of the transfer. However, we find no effect of the transfer across several measures of physical health as captured by multiple well-validated survey measures and biomarkers derived from blood draws. We can rule out even very small improvements in physical health and the effect that would be implied by the cross-sectional correlation between income and health lies well outside our confidence intervals. We also find that the transfer did not improve mental health after the first year and by year 2 we can again reject very small improvements. We also find precise null effects on self-reported access to health care, physical activity, sleep, and several other measures related to preventive care and health behaviors. Our results imply that more targeted interventions may be more effective at reducing health inequality between high- and low-income individuals, at least for the population and time frame that we study.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32711,32711,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
The impact of ECB Banking Supervision on climate risk and sustainable finance,"Andreas Beyer, Lena Schreiner","This paper provides a first empirical analysis of the impact of the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) climate-risk-related supervisory efforts on (i) climate risk exposure and related risk management of banks; and (ii) on the induced shifts in banks’ portfolio choices with regard to additional green finance. From 2020 onwards, the ECB has introduced various measures to enhance climate-risk-related supervisory efforts. Our identification strategy exploits the fact that the ECB’s efforts on climate supervision has only been introduced for selected banks within the European Union i.e., the Significant Institutions under the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Other banks (i.e., the Less Significant Institutions) have remained unaffected. We set up a difference-in-difference setup based on a novel data set and find a significant impact on both improvements in climate risk exposure and management and on an increase in banks’ green finance activities.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2952~384c55df93.en.pdf?8f4cbc327164492003fa44af2f840e85,2952,22-Jul-24,ECB,7/22/2024
Paid Sick Leave and Childcare,Johanna Catherine Maclean & Sabrina Wulff Pabilonia,"Unlike most developed countries, the U.S. lacks a federal paid sick leave policy. As a result, many workers must choose between losing earnings and attending to childcare responsibilities. To date, 14 states and the District of Columbia have adopted paid sick leave mandates that provide up to seven days of paid leave per year that can be used for family responsibilities and healthcare. In this study, we estimate the effects of state paid sick leave mandates on parents’ time spent providing childcare using time diaries from the 2004–2022 American Time Use Survey. Findings from difference-in-differences estimators suggest that post-mandate, parental time spent providing childcare increases by 4.9%. Effects are generally stronger among women and parents with younger children. Overall, our findings suggest that paid sick leave mandates allow parents to better balance work and family responsibilities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32710,32710,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
"Exploiting Complementarity in Applied General-Equilibrium Models: Heterogeneous Firms, Multinationals, Capacity Constraints, Endogenous Zeros",James R. Markusen,"Applied general-equilibrium (AGE) models have often made compromises to circumvent difficult modeling problems. One of these is avoiding endogenous zeros, ruling out important questions. Traditional perfect competition models: when do technologies or trade links switch from active to inactive or vice versa? Heterogeneous firms: what types of firms are active in equilibrium? Multinationals: when do firms switch from exporting to foreign production? Capacity constraints: could trade links or production sectors hit capacity limits? Here I exploit the complementarity approach to general equilibrium, focusing on modeling heterogeneous firms and endogenous multinational production. Instead of the traditional continuum formulation, there is a discrete and finite set of firm types, differing in marginal costs across but not within types. There is an upper bound on the number of firms that can enter in each firm type. Formulated as a non-linear complementarity problem, we can solve for the set of active firm types in relation to characteristics of the economy such as size or trade costs and their modes of operation: no entry, domestic, exporting, multinational. The analysis easily incorporates endogenous markups and positive aggregate profits. Productivities can be calculated directly from data and no integrals/integration/parametric distributions are required.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32721,32721,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
The Socioeconomic Outcomes of Native Groups in Argentina,Pedro Dal Bó & Carolina Lopez,"This study uses individual-level census data from Argentina to examine the socioeconomic disparities between Native and non-Native people. Native people fare worse across a variety of indicators, including housing, education, employment, and health. On average, the observed disparities amount to 12 percent of the standard deviation and persist even after controlling for factors such as geographic location. Furthermore, there are differences in the intergenerational transmission of education between Natives and non-Natives: for each level of education of the parents, the children of Natives have, on average, fewer years of education than the children of non-Natives. Finally, the study also reveals large differences between Native groups: while some achieve average outcomes that surpass those of the non-Native population, others significantly lag behind. Notably, these differences are correlated with a characteristic of their pre-Columbian economy: the practice of agriculture.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32704,32704,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Anti-social norms,"Leopoldo Fergusson, José-Alberto Guerra & James A. Robinson","Since formal rules can only partially reduce opportunistic behavior, third-party sanctioning to promote fairness is critical to achieving desirable social outcomes. Social norms may underpin such behavior, but they can also undermine it. We study one such norm the ""don’t be a toad"" norm, as it is referred to in Colombia that tells people to mind their own business and not snitch on others. In a set of fairness games where a third party can punish unfair behavior, but players can invoke the ""don’t be a toad"" norm, we find that the mere possibility of invoking this norm completely reverses the benefits of third-party sanctioning to achieve fair social outcomes. We establish this is an anti-social norm in a well-defined sense: most players consider it inappropriate, yet they expect the majority will invoke it. To understand this phenomenon we develop an evolutionary model of endogenous social norm transmission and demonstrate that a payoff advantage from adherence to the norm in social dilemmas, combined with sufficient heterogeneity in the disutility of those who view the norm as inappropriate, can generate the apparent paradox of an anti-social norm in the steady-state equilibrium. We provide further evidence that historical exposure to political violence, which increased the ostracization of snitches, raised sensitivity to this norm.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32717,32717,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
The Employment Effects of a Guaranteed Income: Experimental Evidence from Two U.S. States,"Eva Vivalt, Elizabeth Rhodes, Alexander W. Bartik, David E. Broockman & Sarah Miller","We study the causal impacts of income on a rich array of employment outcomes, leveraging an experiment in which 1,000 low-income individuals were randomized into receiving $1,000 per month unconditionally for three years, with a control group of 2,000 participants receiving $50/month. We gather detailed survey data, administrative records, and data from a custom mobile phone app. The transfer caused total individual income to fall by about $1,500/year relative to the control group, excluding the transfers. The program resulted in a 2.0 percentage point decrease in labor market participation for participants and a 1.3-1.4 hour per week reduction in labor hours, with participants’ partners reducing their hours worked by a comparable amount. The transfer generated the largest increases in time spent on leisure, as well as smaller increases in time spent in other activities such as transportation and finances. Despite asking detailed questions about amenities, we find no impact on quality of employment, and our confidence intervals can rule out even small improvements. We observe no significant effects on investments in human capital, though younger participants may pursue more formal education. Overall, our results suggest a moderate labor supply effect that does not appear offset by other productive activities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32719,32719,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Contrasting the Local and National Demographic Incidence of Local Labor Demand Shocks,Richard K. Mansfield,"This paper examines how spatial frictions that differ among heterogeneous workers and establishments shape the geographic and demographic incidence of alternative local labor demand shocks, with implications for the appropriate level of government at which to fund local economic initiatives.   LEHD data featuring millions of job transitions facilitate estimation of a rich two-sided labor market assignment model.  The model generates simulated forecasts of many alternative local demand shocks featuring different establishment compositions and local areas.  Workers within 10 miles receive only 11.2% (6.6%) of nationwide welfare (employment) short-run gains, with at least 35.9% (62.0%) accruing to out-of-state workers, despite much larger per-worker impacts for the closest workers. Local incidence by demographic category is very sensitive to shock composition, but different shocks produce similar demographic incidence farther from the shock. Furthermore, the remaining heterogeneity in incidence at the state or national level can reverse patterns of heterogeneous demographic impacts at the local level.  Overall, the results suggest that reduced-form approaches using distant locations as controls can produce accurate estimates of local shock impacts on local workers, but that the distribution of local impacts badly approximates shocks' statewide or national incidence.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32706,32706,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024

Using confidential supervisory data (covering $25 trillion in daily notional exposures) we examine banks’ positions in connection with covered-interest parity (CIP) deviations. Exploiting cross-sectional variation in CIP deviations that have largely challenged existing theories, we document three novel forces that drive bases: 1) foreign safe asset scarcity, 2) market power and segmentation of banks specializing in different markets, and 3) concentration of demand. Our findings shed empirical light on the interplay of frictions influencing banks’ provision of dollar funding.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32707,32707,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Do Mergers and Acquisitions Improve Efficiency? Evidence from Power Plants,Mert Demirer & Ömer Karaduman,"Using rich data on hourly physical productivity and thousands of ownership changes from US power plants, we study the effects of acquisitions on efficiency and underlying mechanisms. We find a 2% average increase in efficiency for acquired plants, beginning five months after acquisitions. Efficiency gains rise to 5% under direct ownership changes, with no significant change when only parent ownership changes. Investigating the mechanisms, three-quarters of the efficiency gain is attributed to increased productive efficiency, while the rest comes from dynamic efficiency through changes in production allocation. Our evidence suggests that high-productivity firms buy underperforming assets from low-productivity firms and make them as productive as their existing assets through operational improvements. Finally, acquired plants improve their performance beyond efficiency by increasing output and reducing outages.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32727,32727,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Government as Venture Capitalists in AI,"Martin Beraja, Wenwei Peng, David Y. Yang & Noam Yuchtman","Venture capital plays an important role in funding and shaping innovation outcomes, characterized by investors’ deep knowledge of the technology, industry, and institutions, as well as their long-running relationships with the entrepreneurship and innovation community. China, in its pursuit of global leadership in AI innovation and technology, has set up government venture capital funds so that both national and local governments act as venture capitalists. These government-led venture capital funds combine features of private venture capital with traditional government innovation policies. In this paper, we collect comprehensive data on China’s government and private venture capital funds. We draw three important contrasts between government and private VC funds: (i) government funds are spatially more dispersed than private funds; (ii) government funds invest in firms with weaker ex-ante performance signals but these firms exhibit growth rates exceeding those of firms in which private funds invest; and (iii) private VC funds follow government VC investments, especially when hometown government funds directly invest on firms with weaker ex-ante performance signals. We interpret these patterns in light of VC funds’ traditional role overcoming information frictions and China’s unique institutional environment, which includes important frictions on mobility and information.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32701,32701,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
The Social Value of Temporary Carbon Removals and Delayed Emissions,Ben Groom & Frank Venmans,"An economic approach to calculating the Social Value of Temporary Reductions (SVTR) in atmospheric carbon is discussed. The SVTR allows different carbon removals projects to be prioritised in a way that maximises welfare and establishes equivalence between temporary, risky removals with permanent ones in terms of avoided welfare losses from climate damages. The approach is compared to previous attempts in the physical and natural sciences and economics to price temporary emissions reductions, none of which successfully integrate economics and climate science. Applications of the SVTR exist in public project appraisal, Life Cycle Analysis, pricing carbon debts and determining short term carbon credit and offset contracts. Potential criticisms of equivalence measures and tonne-year accounting stemming from concerns that temporary removals do not impact long-term temperatures are shown to be special cases of our integrated economic approach. Temporary removals provide transitory cooling benefits and if repeated are equivalent to permanent solutions. They also can have permanent effects via learning by doing or reducing the likelihood of tipping points. The SVTR helps determine how temporary removals can fit into an efficient response to climate. Ruling out temporary removals and equivalence, and the intertemporal transfers that they imply, could unnecessarily tie the hands of policy makers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32734,32734,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Billionaire Superstar: Public Image and Demand for Taxation,Ricardo Perez-Truglia & Jeffrey Yusof,"In the United States, there are 741 billionaires with a combined net worth of $5.2 trillion. These billionaires live highly public lives, with some achieving superstar status. Despite growing inequality, billionaires face effective tax rates lower than the average American. Is this due to a lack of public support for taxation? Is it due to misperceptions about billionaires’ lives and careers? To address these questions, we conducted a survey experiment with a sample of 9,013 Americans. We designed multiple treatments based on research on preferences for redistribution and arguments made by academics, journalists, and the general public to increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy. Our findings reveal significant misperceptions about billionaires, with individuals updating their beliefs in response to information. Contrary to expert predictions that all treatments would positively affect the demand for taxation, most treatments have a null or negative effect. Providing information about the lavish lifestyles of billionaires does have a robust positive effect on the demand for taxation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32712,32712,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
"Estimation of Property Value Changes from Nearby Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Projects in the United States","Kaifang Luo, Yueming Lucy Qiu, Pengfei Liu & Yingdan Mei","Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) techniques are vital to decarbonization goals. A CCUS supply chain captures CO₂ and delivers it to a suitable location where CO₂ can either be used or injected deep underground for long-term storage. CCUS projects reduce carbon emissions but also pose certain risks to local communities. Using nationwide CCUS data combined with property-level transaction records from 1990 to 2021 in the U.S., we quantify the net impact of proximity to CCUS projects on nearby housing prices in light of their positive and negative externalities. The results show that proximity to CCUS projects leads to a price premium on nearby house sales prices, but such effects disappear beyond the 4.2-km buffer. Compared to homes without CCUS projects nearby, houses with CCUS projects within 4.2 km typically command a price premium of 3.90% (or $8,582). CCUS deployment could be facilitated with a more detailed explanation of the housing price premium. The observed increase in property values near CCUS operations in the U.S. provides insights that could inform CCUS project development in other regions, though local regulatory and socio-economic factors must be carefully considered.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32713,32713,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Navigating Software Vulnerabilities: Eighteen Years of Evidence from Medium and Large U.S. Organizations,"Raviv Murciano-Goroff, Ran Zhuo & Shane Greenstein","How prevalent are severe software vulnerabilities, how fast do software users respond to the availability of secure versions, and what determines the variance in the installation distribution? Using the largest dataset ever assembled on user updates, tracking server software updates by over 150,000 medium and large U.S. organizations between 2000 and 2018, this study finds widespread usage of server software with known vulnerabilities, with 57% of organizations using software with severe security vulnerabilities even when secure versions were available. The study estimates several different reduced-form models to examine which organization characteristics correlate with higher vulnerability prevalence and which update characteristics causally explain higher responsiveness to the releases of secure versions. The disclosure of severe vulnerability fixes in software updates does not jolt all organizations into installing them. Factors related to the cost of updating, such as whether the software is hosted on a cloud-based platform and whether the update is an incremental change or a major overhaul, play an important role. Observables cannot easily explain much variation. These findings suggest that there could be high returns to incorporating organizations' relative (in)attentiveness to act on software update releases into the design of cybersecurity policies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32696,32696,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
The Effects of Wealth on Health Care Spending: Evidence from the Housing Market,Michael F. Lovenheim & Jun Hyun Yun,"The U.S. healthcare system requires substantial out-of-pocket payments by most consumers, which can prevent some from receiving needed medical services. Recent policy proposals seek to address this problem by increasing government health care spending in order to reduce out-of-pocket costs. The social value of these policies rests in part on the extent to which consumers face credit constraints in financing medical spending. We present a novel analysis of whether elderly households face such credit constraints by estimating the effects of wealth variation from home price changes on out-of-pocket medical expenditures. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study and various measures of home price changes, we find no evidence that housing wealth impacts out-of-pocket medical spending. The estimates are universally small and precise, allowing us to rule out even modest-sized effects. Effects are zero across the expenditure distribution, for specific categories of expenditure, and for different types of consumers split by health insurance status and SES. Our results suggest that further subsidizing health care for elderly homeowners, the majority of older Americans, would increase moral hazard costs without increasing access to needed care.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32729,32729,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Production Function Estimation Using Subjective Expectations Data,"Agnes Norris Keiller, Áureo de Paula & John Van Reenen","Standard methods for estimating production functions in the Olley and Pakes (1996) tradition require assumptions on input choices. We introduce a new method that exploits (increasingly available) data on a firm’s expectations of its future output and inputs that allows us to obtain consistent production function parameter estimates while relaxing these input demand assumptions. In contrast to dynamic panel methods, our proposed estimator can be implemented on very short panels (including a single cross-section), and Monte Carlo simulations show it outperforms alternative estimators when firms’ material input choices are subject to optimization error. Implementing a range of production function estimators on UK data, we find our proposed estimator yields results that are either similar to or more credible than commonly-used alternatives. These differences are larger in industries where material inputs appear harder to optimize. We show that TFP implied by our proposed estimator is more strongly associated with future jobs growth than existing methods, suggesting that failing to adequately account for input endogeneity may underestimate the degree of dynamic reallocation in the economy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32725,32725,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
HANK faces unemployment,"Agostino Consolo, Matthias Hänsel","Since the advent of Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models, countercyclical unemployment risk has been deemed an important amplification mechanism for business cycles shocks. Yet, the aggregate effects of such “unemployment fears” are hard to pin down. We thus revisit this issue in the context of a rich two-asset HANK model, proposing new ways to isolate their general equilibrium effects and tackle the long-standing challenge of modelling wage bargaining in this class of model. While unemployment fears can exert noticeable aggregate effects, we find their magnitude to depend importantly on the distribution of firm profits. Households’ ability to borrow stabilizes the economy. Our framework has also implications for policy: in the aftermath of an adverse energy price shock, fiscal policy can help reducing the hysteresis effects on unemployment and most households gain if the central bank accommodates an employment recovery at the cost of higher inflation.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2953~5ee2906d40.en.pdf?02e541bd815aa7cd1ff32aeb784d4e7e,2953,22-Jul-24,ECB,7/22/2024
Granular Income Inequality and Mobility using IDDA: Exploring Patterns across Race and Ethnicity,"Illenin O. Kondo, Kevin Rinz, Natalie Gubbay, Brandon Hawkins, John L. Voorheis & Abigail K. Wozniak","We explore the evolution of income inequality and mobility in the U.S. for a large number of subnational groups defined by race and ethnicity, using granular statistics describing income distributions, income mobility, and conditional income growth derived from the universe of tax filers and W-2 recipients that we observe over a two-decade period (1998–2019). We find that income inequality and income growth patterns identified from administrative tax records differ in important ways from those that one might identify in public survey sources. The full set of statistics that we construct is available publicly alongside this paper as the Income Distributions and Dynamics in America, or IDDA, dataset. Using two applications, we illustrate IDDA’s relevance for understanding income inequality trends. First, we extend Bayer and Charles (2018) beyond earnings gaps between Black and White men and document that, unlike those for other groups, earnings for both Black men and Black women fell behind earnings for White men following the Great Recession. This trend lasted through 2019, the end of the data period.

Taxing Capital in a Globalized World: The Effects of Automatic Information Exchange,"Hjalte Fejerskov Boas, Niels Johannesen, Claus Thustrup Kreiner, Lauge Truels Larsen & Gabriel Zucman","In the second half of the 2010s more than 100 countries—including all large offshore financial centers—started to automatically exchange bank information with foreign tax authorities. This informational big-bang marks a break with the situation of offshore bank secrecy that prevailed before. We study its effects on tax compliance by analyzing the universe of information reports sent by foreign banks to Danish authorities, matched to population-wide micro-data on income, wealth, and cross-border bank transfers. In response to the automatic exchange of bank information, tax evaders may repatriate previously undeclared offshore wealth, they may start to self-report offshore income to the tax authorities, or the tax authorities may detect their evasion in audits that use the new information reports. Using a variety of research designs, we find large compliance effects along all these margins, with the largest response coming from repatriation of wealth. Overall we estimate that the automatic exchange of bank information has closed about 70% of the offshore tax gap. These results highlight the power of international cooperation to improve tax compliance: tax evasion is not a law of nature in a globalized world.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32714,32714,24-Jul,NBER,7/22/2024
Average inflation targeting: how far to look into the past and the future?,"Frantisek Masek, Jan Zemlicka","We analyze the optimal window length in the average inflation targeting rule within a Behavioral THANK model. The central bank faces an occasionally binding effective lower bound (ELB) or persistent supply shocks, and can also use quantitative easing. We show that the optimal averaging period is infinitely long given a conventional degree of myopia. Finite yet long-lasting windows dominate for higher cognitive discounting; i.e., the makeup property is shown to be qualitatively resistant to deviation from rational expectations. We point out that the optimal window may depend on the speed of return to the target path. We solve the model both locally and globally to disentangle the effects of uncertainty due to the ELB.

Given the prolonged duration of loan recovery, spanning several years, and the potential for macroeconomic fluctuations during this time frame, our study explores whether the sensitivity of realised LGD to macroeconomic conditions varies based on the timing of cash flows. We find that, regardless of the cash flow timing, the sensitivity of the LGD to macroeconomic conditions is higher for real-estate secured loans than for unsecured loans. The most relevant macroeconomic variables for the secured LGD are unemployment rate and stock returns, followed by house prices and the long-term interest rate. For unsecured loans, real GDP growth and stock returns are the most relevant predictors.

Trade and Inequality in an Overlapping Generations Model with Capital Accumulation,"Jun Nie, B. Ravikumar, and Michael J. Sposi","We study the lifecycle aspect of within-country inequality that stems from capital and labor services supplied by individuals. Our environment is a combination of a multicountry trade model and an overlapping generations model with production and capital accumulation. Trade liberalization increases the measured total factor productivity in each country, which increases the marginal product of capital and incentivizes capital accumulation. Higher capital stock and higher measured productivity raise the marginal product of labor and, hence, wages. Inequality, measured by the ratio of old agents' income to that of the young, evolves over time due to capital accumulation during the transition from autarky to an open-economy world. Immediately after liberalization, inequality increases. Over time, capital accumulates at a diminishing rate and inequality declines.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-018,2024-018A,24-Jul,FED-STLOUIS,7/24/2024

The explicit inclusion of equilibrium real exchange rate appreciation in the identification of the natural rate is the main deviation from the Laubach-Williams approach.

Public Perceptions of Canada’s Investment Climate,Flora Lutz ; Yuanchen Yang ; Chengyu Huang,"Canada’s muted productivity growth during recent years has sparked concerns about the country’s investment climate. In this study, we develop a new natural language processing (NPL) based indicator, mining the richness of Twitter (now X) accounts to measure trends in the public perceptions of Canada’s investment climate. We find that while the Canadian investment climate appears to be generally favorable, there are signs of slippage in some categories in recent periods, such as with respect to governance and infrastructure. This result is confirmed by both survey-based and NLP-based indicators. We also find that our NLP-based indicators would suggest that perceptions of Canada’s investment climate are similar to perceptions of U.S. investment climate, except with respect to governance, where views of U.S. governance are notably more negative. Comparing our novel indicator relative to traditional survey-based indicators, we find that the NLP-based indicators are statistically significant in helping to predict investment flows, similar to survey-based measures.

The benefits of CCOs as coordination devices can make them optimal even if CCOs entail deadweight losses; if the latter are large, however, CCOs are detrimental for welfare.

We use trade‑level data to study price pressure effects in the UK gilt market from September to October 2022. During this period, forced sales by liability‑driven investment funds (LDI funds) led to price discounts on the order of 10%, accounting for roughly half the total decline in gilt prices. Balance sheet segmentation and operational issues slowed equity injections into LDIs by well‑capitalised pension investors, leading LDIs to instead sell gilts. This effect was most pronounced for pooled LDIs, which invest on behalf of multiple pension schemes, because of co‑ordination problems between pensions.

Firms’ sales expectations and marginal propensity to invest,"Andrea Alati, Johannes J Fischer, Maren Froemel and Ozgen Ozturk","By Andrea Alati, Johannes J Fischer, Maren Froemel and Ozgen Ozturk

How do firms adjust their investment in response to sales shocks and what determines the response? Using a unique firm‑level survey, we propose a novel approach to estimate UK firms’ marginal propensity to invest (MPI) out of additional income: the forecast error of their sales growth expectations. Investment responds significantly to these sales surprises, with a 1 percentage point unexpected growth in sales translating into a 0.31 percentage point increase in capital expenditure. Firms that are more attentive to the state of the economy are more responsive, consistent with sales growth surprises providing firms with information about their demand. Sales growth surprises also cause firms to increase their prices, supporting this interpretation. We do not find evidence that these results are driven by financial frictions, uncertainty, or productivity shocks.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/firms-sales-expectations-and-marginal-propensity-to-invest,1087,"Fri, 26 Jul 2024 ",BOE,7/27/2024
Can Mobile Technologies Enhance Productivity? A Structural Model and Evidence from Benin Food Suppliers,Cedric I Okou,"This paper analyzes the drivers of digital technologies adoption and how it affects the productivity of small scale businesses in Africa. We use data collected from two semi-rural markets in Benin, where grains and legumes are key staple foods and one-third of the population has internet access. We develop a structural model to rationalize digital technologies adoption—defined as the use of mobile broadband internet connection through smartphones—as well as usage patterns and outcomes observed in the data. The model’s implications are empirically tested using both reduced-form and structural maximum likelihood estimations. We find that younger, wealthier, more educated grains and legumes suppliers and those closely surrounded by other users are more likely to adopt digital technologies. Adopters perform 4-5 more business transactions each month than non-adopters on average, suggesting that digital technologies adoption could raise the monthly frequency and amounts of trades by up to 50%. Most adopters are women, but their productivity gains are lower than their male counterparts. Counterfactual policy simulations with the estimated model suggest that upgrading the broadband internet quality yields the largest improvement in adoption rate and productivity gains, while reducing its cost for a given connection quality only has a moderate effect.

Climate Policies and External Adjustment,Rudolfs Bems ; Luciana Juvenal ; Weifeng Liu ; Warwick J. McKibbin,"This paper assesses the economic effects of climate policies on different regions and countries with a focus on external adjustment. The paper finds that various climate policies could have substantially different impacts on external balances over the next decade. A credible and globally coordinated carbon tax would decrease current account balances in greener advanced economies and increase current accounts in more fossil-fuel-dependent regions, reflecting a disproportionate decline in investment for the latter group. Green supply-side policies—green subsidy and infrastructure investment—would increase investment and saving but would have a more muted external sector impact because of the constrained pace of expansion for renewables or the symmetry of the infrastructure boost. Country characteristics, such as initial carbon intensity and net fossil fuel exports, ultimately determine the current account responses. For the global economy, a coordinated climate change mitigation policy package would shift capital towards advanced economies. Following an initial rise, the global interest rates would fall over time with increases in the carbon tax. These external sector effects, however, depend crucially on the degree of international policy coordination and credibility.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/07/26/Climate-Policies-and-External-Adjustment-552075,2024-162,"Fri, 26 Jul 2024 ",IMF,7/27/2024
Estimating the Potential Impact of Combined Race and Ethnicity Reporting on Long-Term Earnings Statistics,Kevin L. McKinney & John M.

We focus on foreign-born persons from countries that are heavily Hispanic and from countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). We find substantial heterogeneity of long-term earnings differentials within country of birth, some of which will be difficult to detect when the reporting format changes from the current two-question version to the new single-question version because they depend on self-identifications that place the individual in two distinct categories within the single-question format, specifically, Hispanic and White or Black, and MENA and White or Black. We also study the USA-born children of these same immigrants. Long-term earnings differences for the 2nd generation also vary as a function of self-identified ethnicity and race in ways that changing to the single-question format could affect.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32758,32758,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Limits on Regret as a Tool for Incentive Design,"Felipe Araujo, Alex Imas & Alistair Wilson","We demonstrate the pitfalls when extrapolating behavioral findings across different contexts and decision environments. We focus on regret theory and the use of “regret lotteries” for motivating behavior change. Here, findings from one-shot settings have been used to promote regret as a tool to boost incentives in recurrent decisions across many settings. Using theory and experiments, we replicate regret lotteries as the superior one-shot incentive; however, for repeated decisions the comparative static is entirely reversed. Moreover, the effects are extremely sensitive to details of regret implementation. Our results suggest caution should be used when designing incentive schemes that exploit regret.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32759,32759,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Elephants in Equity Markets,"Hélène Rey, Adrien Rousset Planat, Vania Stavrakeva & Jenny Tang","We introduce a novel empirical decomposition of equity price growth rates in terms of equity holdings, based on market-clearing conditions. Although our sample holdings cover only an average of 5% of market capitalization, our reconstructed equity holdings account for, on average, 89% of the time variation in over 20,000 individual stock prices and 96% of the fluctuations in 33 aggregate stock markets. Using this decomposition, we introduce new stylized facts to inform asset pricing models. We find that changes in portfolio weights explain most of the variation of individual stock prices, while aggregate wealth effects are more important for the overall stock market fluctuations. Equity markets are global and exchange rates play a key equilibrating role. They dampen local stock market volatility for all stock markets, except those associated with the three safe-haven currencies---USD, JPY, and CHF---and currencies pegged to the USD.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32756,32756,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Worker Representatives,"Julian Budde, Thomas Dohmen, Simon Jäger & Simon Trenkle","We study the descriptive and substantive representation of workers through worker representatives, focusing on the selection of German works council representatives and their impact on worker outcomes. Becoming a professional representative leads to substantial wage gains for the elected, concentrated among blue-collar workers. Representatives are positively selected in terms of pre-election earnings and person fixed effects. They are more likely to have undergone vocational training, show greater interest in politics, and lean left politically compared to the employees they represent; blue-collar workers are close to proportionally represented among works councilors. Drawing on a retirement-IV strategy and event-study designs around council elections, we find that blue-collar representatives reduce involuntary separations, consistent with blue-collar workers placing stronger emphasis on job security",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32740,32740,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Is Model Accuracy Enough? A Field Evaluation Of A Machine Learning Model To Catch Bogus Firms,"Taha Barwahwala, Aprajit Mahajan, Shekhar Mittal & Ofir Reich","We investigate the use of a machine learning (ML) algorithm to identify fraudulent non-existent firms. Using a rich dataset of tax returns over several years in an Indian state, we train an ML-based model to predict fraudulent firms. We then use the model predictions to carry out field inspections of firms identified as suspicious by the ML tool. We find that the ML model is accurate in both simulated and field settings in identifying non-existent firms. Withholding a randomly selected group of firms from inspection, we estimate the causal impact of ML driven inspections. Despite its strong predictive and field performance, the model driven inspections do not yield a significant increase in enforcement as measured by the cancellation of fraudulent firm registrations and tax recovery. We provide two rationales for this discrepancy based on a close analysis of the tax department’s operating protocols: selection bias, and institutional friction in integrating the model into existing administrative systems. Our study serves as a cautionary tale for the application of machine learning in public policy contexts and of relying solely on test set performance as an effectiveness indicator. Field evaluations are critical in assessing the real-world impact of predictive models.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32705,32705,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Rising Markups and the Role of Consumer Preferences,"Hendrik Döpper, Alexander MacKay, Nathan H. Miller & Joel Stiebale","We characterize the evolution of markups for consumer products in the United States from 2006 to 2019. Using detailed data on prices and quantities for products in more than 100 distinct product categories, we estimate flexible demand systems and recover markups under an assumption that firms set prices to maximize profit. Our empirical strategy obtains a panel of consumer preferences and marginal costs based on the estimation of separate random coefficient models by category and year. We find that markups increased by about 30 percent on average over the sample period. The change is primarily attributable to decreases in marginal costs, as real prices only increased slightly from 2006 to 2019. Our estimates indicate that consumers have become less price sensitive over time.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32739,32739,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
A Welfare Analysis of Policies Impacting Climate Change,"Robert W. Hahn, Nathaniel Hendren, Robert D. Metcalfe & Ben Sprung-Keyser","What are the most effective ways to address climate change? This paper extends and applies the marginal value of public funds (MVPF) framework to help answer this question. We examine 96 US environmental policy changes studied over the past 25 years. These policies span subsidies (wind, residential solar, electric and hybrid vehicles, vehicle retirement, appliance rebates, weatherization), nudges (marketing, energy conservation), and revenue raisers (fuel taxes, cap and trade). For each policy, we draw upon quasi-experimental or experimental evaluations of causal effects and translate those estimates into an MVPF. We apply a consistent translation of these behavioral responses into measures of their associated externalities and valuations of those externalities. We also provide a new method for incorporating learning-by-doing spillovers. The analysis yields three main results: First, subsidies for investments that directly displace the dirty production of electricity, such as production tax credits for wind power and subsidies for residential solar panels, have higher MVPFs (generally exceeding 2) than all other subsidies in our sample (with MVPFs generally around 1). Second, nudges to reduce energy consumption have large MVPFs, with values above 5, when targeted to regions of the US with a dirty electric grid. By contrast, policies targeting areas with cleaner grids such as California and the Northeast have substantially smaller MVPFs (often below 1). Third, fuel taxes and cap-and-trade policies are highly efficient means of raising revenue (with MVPFs below 0.7) due to the presence of large environmental externalities. We contrast these conclusions with those derived from more traditional cost-per-ton metrics used in previous literature.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32728,32728,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Pricing the Priceless: The Financial Cost of Biodiversity Conservation,"Fukang Chen, Minhao Chen, Lin William Cong, Haoyu Gao & Jacopo Ponticelli","The pace of biodiversity loss requires drastic shifts in conservation efforts that carry substantial costs. We investigate how the financial market prices such conservation costs exploiting the ""Green Shield Action,"" a major regulatory initiative launched by the Chinese central government in 2017 to enforce biodiversity preservation rules in national nature reserves. We document that, while improving local biodiversity, the initiative led to a significant increase in bond yields for Chinese municipalities with national nature reserves. Evidence suggests that these effects are driven by expected increases in transition costs resulting from shutting down illegal economic activities within reserves and local public spending on biodiversity following the initiative. Overall, our results indicate that investors show little consideration beyond financial payoffs towards endeavors counteracting biodiversity loss.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32743,32743,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Tax Incentives for Charitable Giving: New Findings from the TCJA,"Xiao Han, Daniel M.

Basic theory and our empirical results suggest heterogeneous effects for taxpayers with different amounts of itemizable expenses. Overall, the reform decreased charitable giving by about $20 billion annually. Using a new method to adjust estimates for retimed giving, we find evidence of moderate intertemporal shifts from pre-announcement of the law. The permanent price elasticity of giving estimates range from .6 for the average donor to over 2 for those predicted to be most responsive to the reform.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32737,32737,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
"Family Planning, Now and Later: Infertility Fears and Contraceptive Take-Up","Natalie Bau, David J. Henning, Corinne Low & Bryce Steinberg","Early fertility is a key barrier to female human capital attainment in sub-Saharan Africa, yet contraceptive take-up remains puzzlingly low, even among educated populations with healthcare access. We study a barrier to hormonal contraceptive uptake that has not been causally tested: the persistent (incorrect) belief that these contraceptives cause later infertility. This belief creates a perceived tradeoff between current and future reproductive control. We use a randomized controlled trial with female undergraduates at the flagship university in Zambia to test two interventions to increase contraceptive use. Despite high rates of sexual activity, low rates of condom-use, and near zero desire for current pregnancy, only 5% of this population uses hormonal contraceptives at baseline. Providing a non-coercive conditional cash transfer to visit a local clinic only temporarily increases contraceptive use. However, pairing this transfer with information addressing fears that contraceptives cause infertility has a larger initial effect and persistently increases take-up over 6 months. This treatment reduces beliefs that contraceptives cause infertility and leads to the take-up of longer-lasting contraceptives. Compliers are more likely to cite fear of infertility as the reason for not using contraceptives at baseline. Eliminating the belief that contraceptives cause infertility would more than triple contraceptive use.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32735,32735,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Regulating the Direction of Innovation,Joshua S. Gans,"This paper examines the regulation of technological innovation direction under uncertainty about potential harms. We develop a model with two competing technological paths and analyze various regulatory interventions. Our findings show that market forces tend to inefficiently concentrate research on leading paths. We demonstrate that ex post regulatory instruments, particularly liability regimes, outperform ex ante restrictions in most scenarios. The optimal regulatory approach depends critically on the magnitude of potential harm relative to technological benefits. Our analysis reveals subtle insurance motives in resource allocation across research paths, challenging common intuitions about diversification. These insights have important implications for regulating emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, suggesting the need for flexible, adaptive regulatory frameworks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32741,32741,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
"The Nexus between Long-term Care Insurance, Formal Care, Informal Care, and Bequests: The Case of Japan","Charles Yuji Horioka, Emin Gahramanov & Xueli Tang","The purpose of this paper is to conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of the nexus between long-term care insurance (LTCI), formal care, informal (family) care, and bequests. In our empirical analysis, we use micro data from the Japan Household Panel Survey on Consumer Preferences and Satisfaction (JHPS-CPS), formerly known as the Preference Parameter Study, conducted by Osaka University. Japan is an interesting case to analyze because a public LTCI system was introduced there in 2000. Our analysis shows that, in the case of Japan, if parents are eligible for public LTCI benefits, their children will be less likely to be their primary caregiver and that this, in turn, will reduce their children’s perceived likelihood of receiving a bequest from them. This result implies that bequests are selfishly or strategically motivated (i.e., that parents leave bequests to their children in order to elicit care from them) and that the introduction of a public LTCI system will reduce the likelihood of children providing care to their parents and through this channel reduce their perceived likelihood of receiving a bequest from them.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32744,32744,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Incentives and Habit Formation in Health Screenings: Evidence from the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study,"Damon Jones, David Molitor & Julian Reif","We study habit formation in annual biometric health screenings using a field experiment that randomly assigned financial incentives to 4,799 employees over three years. Completing the first screening raised subsequent screenings by 32.4-36.0 percentage points (84%-90%) annually. Habit formation was similar whether employees were offered screenings as part of a comprehensive wellness program or just screenings alone, suggesting such habits can develop without frequent interactions. We rule out inattention as an explanation, using a subsample assigned more salient incentives. The long-run effect stems from the initial decision to participate, indicating a habit formation process with a one-shot mechanism.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32745,32745,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Trends in Competition in the United States: What Does the Evidence Show?,Carl Shapiro & Ali Yurukoglu,"Has the United States economy become less competitive in recent decades? One might think so based on a body of research that has rapidly become influential for antitrust policy. We explain that the empirical evidence relating to concentration trends, markup trends, and the effects of mergers does not actually show a widespread decline in competition. Nor does it provide a basis for dramatic changes in antitrust policy. To the contrary, in many respects the evidence indicates that the observed changes in many industries are likely to reflect competition in action. We highlight research that points to targeted interventions that can enable antitrust enforcement policy to better promote and protect competition. Throughout the paper, we identify open questions and opportunities for future research in the cross-industry evidence-at-scale paradigm, the industry-specific study paradigm, and their intersection.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32762,32762,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
The Micro and Macro Productivity of Nations,"Stephen Ayerst, Duc M.

Empirically, less developed countries feature higher distortions and larger dispersion in firm-level productivity, mostly resulting from the higher prevalence of unproductive firms. Quantitatively, measured cross-country differences in the elasticity of distortions with respect to firm productivity generate the bulk of empirical patterns and over two-thirds of cross-country labor productivity differences. Both selection and technology channels are important. Variation in static misallocation also plays an important role, albeit smaller.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32750,32750,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Pace of Adoption of Alternatives to Animal-Source Foods and Climate Goals,"Galina Hale, Vlad Onescu & Ritesh Bhangale","The global food system is an important contributor to greenhouse gas emissions that lead to climate change. Animal agriculture is responsible for a large share of the food-system emissions, both directly and through the production of animal feed. Limiting global warming to the goals set forth by the international community will not be possible without rapid phasing out of a substantial share of animal-source food. We show that the rapid adoption of alternatives to animal-source foods, such as plant-only diet, or plant-based, cultured, or fermentation-derived analogs to animal products, can be consistent with climate goals. Importantly, the longer the delay in the adoption of alternatives, the larger the share of diet they will have to represent in 2050 for the food system to stay within its carbon budget.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32736,32736,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Adjusting Labor Along The Intensive Margins,Daniel S.

Using large cross sections of U.S. data, 1985-2018, we observe around 1/4 of the adjustment in weekly hours occurring through changing days/week. There is no adjustment of days/week in manufacturing; but 1/3 of the adjustment outside manufacturing occurs through days/week. The desirability of bunched leisure implies that secular shifts away from manufacturing have contributed to increasing economic welfare.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32752,32752,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Servicing Development: Productive Upgrading of Labor-Absorbing Services in Developing Economies,Dani Rodrik & Rohan Sandhu,"Manufacturing generates very little employment in the developing world. Urban jobs are predominantly informal, unproductive, and in services. It seems unlikely that manufacturing will be able to absorb the new increments to the labor force or create more productive jobs for those that are already stuck in petty services. Raising productivity in services has been traditionally difficult, but is now necessary to achieve long-term growth in the standard of living. We discuss and provide evidence for four broad strategies: (a) incentivizing large, productive firms to expand their employment; (b) enhancing productive capabilities of smaller firms through the provision of public inputs; (c) providing workers or firms technologies that explicitly complement low-skill labor; (d) vocational training with “wrap-around” services to enhance job seekers’ employability, job retention, and eventual promotion.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32738,32738,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
How Much Will Global Warming Cool Global Growth?,"Ishan B. Nath, Valerie A. Ramey & Peter J. Klenow","Does a permanent rise in temperature decrease the level or growth rate of GDP in affected countries? Differing answers to this question lead prominent estimates of climate damages to diverge by an order of magnitude. This paper combines indirect evidence on economic growth with new empirical estimates of the dynamic effects of temperature on GDP to argue that warming has persistent, but not permanent, effects on growth. We start by presenting a range of evidence that technology flows tether country growth rates together, preventing temperature changes from causing growth rates to diverge permanently. We then use data from a panel of countries to show that temperature shocks have large and persistent effects on GDP, driven in part by persistence in temperature itself. These estimates imply projected future impacts that are three to five times larger than level effect estimates and two to four times smaller than permanent growth effect estimates, with larger discrepancies for initially hot and cold countries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32761,32761,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
The Graduation Part II: Graduate School Graduation Rates,Jeffrey T. Denning & Lesley J.

Despite conventional wisdom that most graduate students complete their programs, only 58 percent of who started their program in 2004 graduated within 6 years. Between the 2004 and 2013 entering cohorts, graduate student completion rates grew by 10 percentage points. Graduation rates vary widely by field of study--ranging from an average of 81 percent for law programs to 53 percent for education programs. We also find large differences in graduation rates across institutions. On average, 72 percent of students who entered programs in flagship public universities graduated in 6 years compared to only 57 percent of those who entered programs in non-research intensive (non-R1) institutions. Graduate students who do not complete may face negative consequences due to lower average earnings and substantial levels of student debt.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32749,32749,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Nonlinear Dynamics in Menu Cost Economies? Evidence from U.S. Data,"Andrés Blanco, Corina Boar, Callum J.

Though the Golosov and Lucas (2007) model generates fluctuations in the fraction of price changes, it predicts too little dispersion in the size of price changes and therefore little monetary non-neutrality. In contrast, versions of the model that reproduce the dispersion in the size of price changes and generate stronger monetary non-neutrality predict a nearly constant fraction of price changes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32748,32748,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Changing Opportunity: Sociological Mechanisms Underlying Growing Class Gaps and Shrinking Race Gaps in Economic Mobility,"Raj Chetty, Will S. Dobbie, Benjamin Goldman, Sonya Porter & Crystal Yang","We show that intergenerational mobility changed rapidly by race and class in recent decades and use these trends to study the causal mechanisms underlying changes in economic mobility. For white children in the U.S. born between 1978 and 1992, earnings increased for children from high-income families but decreased for children from low-income families, increasing earnings gaps by parental income (“class”) by 30%. Earnings increased for Black children at all parental income levels, reducing white- Black earnings gaps for children from low-income families by 30%. Class gaps grew and race gaps shrank similarly for non-monetary outcomes such as educational attainment, standardized test scores, and mortality rates. Using a quasi-experimental design, we show that the divergent trends in economic mobility were caused by differential changes in childhood environments, as proxied by parental employment rates, within local communities defined by race, class, and childhood county. Outcomes improve across birth cohorts for children who grow up in communities with increasing parental employment rates, with larger effects for children who move to such communities at younger ages. Children’s outcomes are most strongly related to the parental employment rates of peers they are more likely to interact with, such as those in their own birth cohort, suggesting that the relationship between children’s outcomes and parental employment rates is mediated by social interaction. Our findings imply that community-level changes in one generation can propagate to the next generation and thereby generate rapid changes in economic mobility.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32697,32697,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Mobilizing the Manpower of Mothers: Childcare under the Lanham Act during WWII,"Joseph P. Ferrie, Claudia Goldin & Claudia Olivetti","The Lanham Act was a federal infrastructure bill passed by Congress in 1940 and eventually used to fund programs for the preschool and school-aged children of working women during WWII. It remains, to this day, the only example in US history of an (almost) universal, largely federally-supported childcare program. We explore its role in enabling and increasing the labor supply of mothers during WWII. Our information is at the city or town level and includes war contracts, the size of and expenditures on the childcare program, and the “reserve labor force” of mothers as of 1939. We find that the programs became well-funded but were late to start, limited in scope, and incapable of greatly increasing women’s employment in the aggregate. They were more numerous in places that already had high participation rates of women suggesting that they were effective in caring for the children of women who had already entered the labor force. Their impact on the children as adults is still to be determined.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32755,32755,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Intergenerational Impacts of Secondary Education: Experimental Evidence from Ghana,"Esther Duflo, Pascaline Dupas, Elizabeth Spelke & Mark P. Walsh","We provide experimental evidence on the intergenerational impacts of secondary education subsidies in a low-income context, leveraging a randomized controlled trial and 15-year longitudinal follow-up. For young women, receiving a scholarship for secondary school delays childbearing and marriage, and reduces unwanted pregnancies. Female scholarship recipients are more likely to marry a partner with tertiary education and their children have better early childhood development outcomes. In particular, we document a 45% reduction in under-three mortality as well as cognitive development gains of 0.25 standard deviations of test scores once children are of school age. The primary mechanism seems to be that more-educated caregivers have the knowledge and skills to safeguard their children’s health and stimulate their cognitive development. In contrast, we find no evidence of a positive impact for the children of male scholarship recipients, who tend to marry less educated partners. Together, these results suggest a key role for maternal education in child outcomes. We also estimate the cost-benefit ratio for secondary school scholarships and find that the impact on child survival alone is sufficient to make them a highly cost-effective investment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32742,32742,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Filtering with Limited Information,"Thorsten Drautzburg, Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Pablo A.

If two conditions are satisfied, we can use a flexible statistical model and a known measurement equation to back out the hidden states of the dynamic model. The first condition is that the state is sufficiently volatile or persistent to be recoverable. The second condition requires the possibly non-linear measurement to be sufficiently smooth and to map uniquely to the state absent measurement error. We illustrate the method through various simulation studies and an empirical application to a sudden stops model applied to Mexican data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32754,32754,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Social Insurance Spillovers: Evidence From Paid Sick Leave Mandates and Workers' Compensation,"Xiuming Dong, Johanna Catherine Maclean & David Powell","Social insurance programs shield individuals from specific risks, but these programs are not necessarily independent of each other. The existence and scope of one program can potentially influence the use of others, especially when the risks covered by the programs are related. This study investigates the relationship between two mandated benefit programs in the United States: state paid sick leave (PSL) mandates and workers’ compensation. Unlike most developed countries, the U.S. lacks a federal PSL mandate; however, 15 states have implemented such policies. PSL mandates require firms to provide compensated time off for employee health-related needs, while workers’ compensation offers benefits to help workers recover from workplace injuries or illnesses. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, the study explores the impact of state PSL mandates on the usage of workers’ compensation benefits. The findings reveal meaningful spillover effects: when states adopt PSL requirements, there is a decrease in workers’ compensation benefit receipt. While some evidence suggests possible improvements in health, there are no observed reductions in workplace injury rates specifically, indicating that workers may substitute PSL benefits directly for workers’ compensation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32751,32751,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Quantitative Tightening with Slow-Moving Capital,Zhengyang Jiang & Jialu Sun,"We document shifts in investor composition during quantitative tightening, which suggest that investors adjust their portfolios at different speeds. To understand its implications for bond valuation, we develop a general equilibrium model which highlights the dynamic interaction between heterogeneous investors. In the model, long-term investors have higher risk-taking capacity, but face a portfolio adjustment cost; liquidity traders have lower risk-taking capacity, but can trade freely. Our model predicts a novel overshooting pattern: when the central bank unwinds its bond purchase, slow adjustment by long-term investors requires liquidity traders to absorb the imbalance, who demand a higher risk premium that creates excessive bond price decline and volatility in the short run. As a result, quantitative tightening is not simply a symmetric reversal of quantitative easing.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32757,32757,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024

"The Impact of Incarceration on Employment, Earnings, and Tax Filing","Andrew Garin, Dmitri K. Koustas, Carl McPherson, Samuel Norris, Matthew Pecenco, Evan K. Rose, Yotam Shem-Tov & Jeffrey Weaver","We study the effect of incarceration on wages, self-employment, and taxes and transfers in North Carolina and Ohio using two quasi-experimental research designs: discontinuities in sentencing guidelines and random assignment to judges. Across both states, incarceration generates short-term drops in economic activity while individuals remain in prison. As a result, a year-long sentence decreases cumulative earnings over five years by 13%. Beyond five years, however, there is no evidence of lower employment, wage earnings, or self-employment in either state, as well as among defendants with no prior incarceration history. These results suggest that upstream factors, such as other types of criminal justice interactions or pre-existing labor market detachment, are more likely to be the cause of low earnings among the previously incarcerated, who we estimate would earn just $5,000 per year on average if spared a prison sentence.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32747,32747,24-Jul,NBER,7/29/2024
Optimal Monetary Policy with Uncertain Private Sector Foresight,Christopher Gust and David Lopez-Salido,"Central banks operate in a world in which there is substantial uncertainty regarding the transmission of its actions to the economy because of uncertainty regarding the formation of private-sector expectations. We model private sector expectations using a finite horizon planning framework: Households and firms have limited foresight when deciding spending, saving, and pricing decisions. In this setting, contrary to standard New Keynesian (NK) models, we show that ""an inflation scares problem"" for the central bank can arise where agents' longer-run inflation expectations deviate persistently from a central bank's inflation target. We formally characterize optimal time-consistent monetary policy when there is uncertainty about the planning horizons of private sector agents and a risk of inflation scares. We show how risk management considerations modify the optimal leaning-against-the-wind principle in the NK literature with a novel, additional preemptive motive to avert inflation scares. We quantify the importance of such risk management considerations during the recent post-pandemic inflation surge.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/optimal-monetary-policy-with-uncertain-private-sector-foresight.htm,2024-059,24-Aug,FED-BOARD,8/3/2024
"Productive Capacities, Economic Vulnerability and Growth Volatility in Sub-Saharan Africa",Aminou Yaya,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries, like most developing countries, face major challenges to achieve strong, sustainable, and inclusive growth with the view to reduce significantly persistent poverty and inequality. Many of these challenges results from a high level of economic vulnerability due to simultaneous shocks, notably the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and the multiplicity of armed conflicts. Hence the need to study policies and means of strengthening economic resilience to shocks. This paper analyzes the effects of productive capacities on the volatility of economic growth in SSA countries when faced with significant vulnerability. The study covers the period 2000-2018 for 43 SSA countries. Using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), the results show that economic vulnerability contributes to growth volatility in SSA. However, this effect varies according to the performance of productive capacities. Countries with high productive capacities have greater opportunities to mitigate the effect of economic vulnerability on growth volatility. Some specific dimensions of productive capacities (Institutions, ICT) seem to matter more than others.

Quantities and Covered-Interest Parity,"Tobias J. Moskowitz, Chase P. Ross, Sharon Y. Ross, Kaushik Vasudevan","Studies of intermediated arbitrage argue that bank balance sheets are an important consideration, yet little evidence exists on banks’ positioning in this context. Using confidential supervisory data (covering $25 trillion in daily notional exposures) we examine banks’ positions in connection with covered-interest parity (CIP) deviations. Exploiting cross-sectional variation in CIP deviations that have largely challenged existing theories, we document three novel forces that drive bases: 1) foreign safe asset scarcity, 2) market power and segmentation of banks specializing in different markets, and 3) concentration of demand.

Consumer Payment Behavior by Income and Demographics,"Claire Greene, Joanna Stavins, Julian Perry","Despite the introduction of an array of innovations and new payment options for consumers over the last decade, income and demographics remain significant predictors of payment behavior. Using data from a 2023 consumer payments diary, we find that income, age, and education are significant predictors of which payment instruments consumers adopt and use. These associations hold not only for traditional payment instruments—cards and paper—but also for innovations such as mobile apps; buy now, pay later (BNPL); and cryptocurrency. In 2023, less educated consumers were significantly less likely than other consumers to adopt any payment instrument, especially checks and electronic payments, even when we control for income and employment. After controlling for education, we find that high-income consumers used credit cards significantly more relative to other consumers. Younger and more educated consumers were most likely to adopt mobile payment apps. Women, Black and Latino consumers, and those who had filed for bankruptcy in the previous year were significantly more likely to have used BNPL. Men were nearly three times as likely as women to adopt cryptocurrency.",https://www.bostonfed.org//publications/research-department-working-paper/2024/consumer-payment-behavior-by-income-and-demographics.aspx,24-8,8/1/2024,FED-BOSTON,8/3/2024
Balance Sheet Policy Uncertainty and Its Aggregate Implications,"Stefania D’Amico, Corey Feldman","Using textual analysis of the largest dealers’ newsletters to their clients, we construct a measure of uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policy (BSP). This measure of uncertainty tends to spike during the introduction of novel aspects of BSP or at its turning points, with the largest spike occurring during the “Taper Tantrum” period. We find that positive shocks to BSP uncertainty increase longer-term Treasury yields, private borrowing costs, private MBS duration, and reduce mortgage refinance volumes. As a result, an increase in BSP uncertainty has contractionary effects similar to those of a monetary-policy tightening shock. Further, post-2008, these effects seem quite different from those of broader monetary policy uncertainty and fiscal policy uncertainty. Overall, our findings suggest that explicit forward guidance about the Fed’s balance-sheet path might be warranted.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-14,2024-14,24-Aug,FED-CHICAGO,8/3/2024
Spectral backtests unbounded and folded,Michael B. Gordy and Alexander J.

We extend this framework to allow general Lebesgue-Stieltjes kernel measures with unbounded distribution functions, which brings powerful new tests based on truncated location-scale families into the spectral class.

Expanding the Frontier of Economic Statistics Using Big Data: A Case Study of Regional Employment,"Abe C. Dunn, Eric English, Kyle K. Hood, Lowell Mason, Brian Quistorff","Big data offers potentially enormous benefits for improving economic measurement, but it also presents challenges (e.g., lack of representativeness and instability), implying that their value is not always clear. We propose a framework for quantifying the usefulness of these data sources for specific applications, relative to existing official sources. We specifically weigh the potential benefits of additional granularity and timeliness, while examining the accuracy associated with any new or improved estimates, relative to comparable accuracy produced in existing official statistics. We apply the methodology to employment estimates using data from a payroll processor, considering both the improvement of existing state-level estimates, but also the production of new, more timely, county-level estimates. We find that incorporating payroll data can improve existing state-level estimates by 11\% based on out-of-sample mean absolute error, although the improvement is considerably higher for smaller state-industry cells. We also produce new county-level estimates that could provide more timely granular estimates than previously available. We develop a novel test to determine if these new county-level estimates have errors consistent with official series. Given the level of granularity, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the new county estimates have an accuracy in line with official measures, implying an expansion of the existing frontier. We demonstrate the practical importance of these experimental estimates by investigating a hypothetical application during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period in which more timely and granular information could have assisted in implementing effective policies. Relative to existing estimates, we find that the alternative payroll data series could help identify areas of the country where employment was lagging. Moreover, we also demonstrate the value of a more timely series.",https://www.bea.gov//research/papers/2024/expanding-frontier-economic-statistics-using-big-data-case-study-regional,WP2024-4,8/2/2024,BEA,8/3/2024
Nonlinear Binscatter Methods,"Matias D. Cattaneo, Richard K. Crump, Max H. Farrell, and Yingjie Feng","Binned scatter plots are a powerful statistical tool for empirical work in the social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences. Available methods rely on a quantile-based partitioning estimator of the conditional mean regression function to primarily construct flexible yet interpretable visualization methods, but they can also be used to estimate treatment effects, assess uncertainty, and test substantive domain-specific hypotheses. This paper introduces novel binscatter methods based on nonlinear, possibly nonsmooth M-estimation methods, covering generalized linear, robust, and quantile regression models. We provide a host of theoretical results and practical tools for local constant estimation along with piecewise polynomial and spline approximations, including (i) optimal tuning parameter (number of bins) selection, (ii) confidence bands, and (iii) formal statistical tests regarding functional form or shape restrictions. Our main results rely on novel strong approximations for general partitioning-based estimators covering random, data-driven partitions, which may be of independent interest.

Financing Private Credit,Nina Boyarchenko and Leonardo Elias,"Using data on balance sheets of both financial and nonfinancial sectors of the economy, we use a “demand system” approach to study how lender composition and willingness to provide credit affect the relationship between credit expansions and real activity. A key advantage of jointly modeling the demand for and supply of credit is the ability to evaluate equilibrium elasticities of credit quantities with respect to variables of interest. We document that the sectoral composition of lenders financing a credit expansion is a key determinant for subsequent real activity and crisis probability. We show that banks and nonbanks respond differentially to changes in macroeconomic conditions, with bank credit more sensitive to economic downturns. Our results thus suggest that secular changes in the structure of the financial sector will affect the dynamics of credit boom-bust cycles.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1111,1111,8/2/2024,FED-NEWYORK,8/3/2024
Industrial Composition of Syndicated Loans and Banks’ Climate Commitments,"Galina Hale, Brigid Meisenbacher, Fernanda Nechio","In the past two decades, a number of banks joined global initiatives aimed to mitigate climate change by “greening” their asset portfolios. We study whether banks that made such commitments have a different emission exposure of their portfolios of syndicated loans than banks that did not. We rely on loan-level information with global coverage combined with country-industry information on emissions. We find that all banks have reduced their loan-emission exposures over the last 8 years. However, we do not find differences between banks that did and those that did not signal their sustainability goals, with the exception of early signers of Principles of Responsible Investments (PRI), who already had lower exposure to emissions through their syndicated lending. In addition, banks that signed PRI shortened the maturity of the loans extended to highly-emitting industries but only temporarily. Thus, we conclude that banks reduced their exposure to climate transition risks on average, but voluntary climate commitments did not contribute to syndicated loan reallocation away from highly-emitting sectors.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/07/industrial-composition-of-syndicated-loans-and-banks-climate-commitments,2024-23,7/31/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,8/3/2024

Bank Competition and Strategic Adaptation to Climate Change,"Dasol Kim,  Luke M. Olson and  Toan Phan","How does competition affect banks' adaptation to emergent risks for which there is limited supervisory oversight? The analysis matches detailed supervisory data on home equity lines of credit with high resolution flood projections to identify climate risks. Following Hurricane Harvey, banks updated their internal risk models to better reflect flood risk projections, even in areas unaffected by the disaster. These updates are only detected in banks with exposures to the disaster, indicating heterogeneous bank learning. We use this heterogeneity to identify how bank adaptation is affected by competition. Exposed banks reduce lending to areas with higher flood risks, but only in less competitive markets, suggesting that competition fosters risk-taking over risk mitigation. Additionally, banks are less likely to adapt in markets where competitors are also less likely to do so, suggesting a strategic complementarity in bank adaptation. More broadly, our paper sheds light on the role of competitive forces in how banks manage emerging risks and relevant supervisory challenges.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2024/wp_24-06,24-06,24-Aug,FED-RICHMOND,8/3/2024

Phillips Meets Beveridge,"Regis Barnichon, Adam Shapiro","The Phillips curve plays a central role in the macroeconomics literature. However, there is little consensus on the forcing variable that drives inflation in the model, i.e., on the appropriate measure of “slack” in the economy. In this work, we systematically assess the ability of variables commonly used in the literature to (i) predict and (ii) explain inflation fluctuations over time and across U.S. metropolitan areas. In particular, we exploit a newly constructed panel dataset with job openings and vacancy filling cost proxies covering 1982-2022. We find that the vacancy-unemployment (V/U) ratio and vacancy filling cost proxies outperform other slack measures, in particular the unemployment rate.

This paper investigates whether these correlations reflect causal effects of wealth by leveraging random, positive wealth shocks in the form of lottery prizes. Compared to suitably matched controls, large-prize winners are no more likely to cast votes in national elections or run for political office. We also find no significant effects of parents’ lottery winnings on their children’s political participation. But winners of large lottery prizes become more negative toward taxes on wealth, real estate and inheritances. Although we do not detect any statistically significant effects on other political preferences, effects tend to go in the direction of a more right-wing political orientation.

Correlation in State and Local Tax Changes,"Scott R. Baker, Pawel Janas & Lorenz Kueng","Empirical research in public economics, including our own, often uses variation in state and local taxes as an empirical laboratory to estimate causal relationships. A key concern is that other taxes might change at the same time. To assess this concern, we develop a dataset of state (1977–2022) and local (2000–2022) tax rates and revenue from personal income, corporate income, property, sales, and excise taxes. This new dataset generates two key results. First, we find that taxes of different types tend to co-move within a jurisdiction: a tax change of one type can more than double the likelihood of a second tax type changing in the same year. Local tax changes also co-move with tax changes enacted by the state they are located in. This positive correlation can upwardly bias elasticity estimates, but only moderately. For example, regressing state economic outcomes on the full set of state tax changes yields elasticities that are about 10–30% smaller than those obtained from using a single tax type in isolation. Second, we document that the mix of taxes across state and local jurisdictions is very different, and that these differences have become more pronounced over time as jurisdictions have increasingly become reliant on the single tax type—sales, personal or corporate income tax—that was most prominent for them in the earliest part of our sample.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32786,32786,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Distributed Ledgers and Secure Multi-Party Computation for Financial Reporting and Auditing,"Sean S.

A federated blockchain for financial reporting and auditing can improve verification efficiency not only for transactions in private databases, but also for cross-chain verifications through privacy-preserving computation protocols. Despite the potential benefit of blockchains, private incentives for firms and first-mover advantages for auditors can create inefficient under-adoption or partial adoption that favors larger auditors. Although a regulator can help coordinate the adoption of technology, endogenous choice of transaction partners by firms can still lead to adoption failure. Our model also provides an initial framework for further studies of the costs and implications of the use of distributed ledgers and secure multi-party computation in financial reporting, including the positive spillover to discretionary auditing and who should bear the cost of adoption.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32763,32763,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
The Impact of Unconditional Cash Transfers on Consumption and Household Balance Sheets: Experimental Evidence from Two US States,"Alexander W. Bartik, Elizabeth Rhodes, David E. Broockman, Patrick K. Krause, Sarah Miller & Eva Vivalt","We provide new evidence on the causal effect of unearned income on consumption, balance sheets, and financial outcomes by exploiting an experiment that randomly assigned 1000 individuals to receive $1000 per month and 2000 individuals to receive $50 per month for three years. The transfer increased measured household expenditures by at least $300 per month. The spending impact is positive in most categories, and is largest for housing, food, and car expenses. The treatment increases housing unit and neighborhood mobility. We find noisily estimated modest positive effects on asset values, driven by financial assets, but these gains are offset by higher debt, resulting in a near-zero effect on net worth. The transfer increased self-reported financial health and credit scores but did not affect credit limits, delinquencies, utilization, bankruptcies, or foreclosures. Adjusting for underreporting, we estimate marginal propensities to consume non-durables between 0.44 and 0.55, durables and semi-durables between 0.21 and 0.26, and marginal propensities to de-lever of near zero. These results suggest that large temporary transfers increase short-term consumption and improve financial health but may not cause persistent improvements in the financial position of young, low-income households.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32784,32784,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
The Long-Run Impacts of Banning Affirmative Action in US Higher Education,"Francisca M. Antman, Brian Duncan & Michael F. Lovenheim","This paper estimates the long-run impacts of banning affirmative action on men and women from under-represented minority (URM) racial and ethnic groups in the United States.  Using data from the US Census and American Community Survey, we use a difference-in-differences framework to compare the college degree completion, graduate degree completion, earnings, and employment of URM individuals to non-URM individuals before and after affirmative action bans went into effect across several US states.  We also employ event study analyses and alternative estimators to confirm the validity of our approach and discuss the generalizability of the findings.  Results suggest that banning affirmative action results in a decline in URM women’s college degree completion, earnings, and employment relative to non-Hispanic White women, driven largely by impacts on Hispanic women.  Thus, affirmative action bans resulted in an increase in racial/ethnic disparities in both college degree completion and earnings among women.  Effects on URM men are more ambiguous and indicate significant heterogeneity across states, with some estimates pointing to a possible positive impact on labor market outcomes of Black men.  These results suggest that the relative magnitude of college quality versus mismatch effects vary for URM men and women and highlight the importance of disaggregating results by gender, race, and ethnicity. We conclude by discussing how our results compare with others in the literature and directions for future research.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32778,32778,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024

Household Mobility and Mortgage Rate Lock,Jack Liebersohn & Jesse Rothstein,"Rising interest rates can create “mortgage rate lock” for homeowners with fixed rate mortgages, who can hold onto their low rates as long as they stay in their homes but would have to take on new mortgages with higher rates if they moved. We show mobility rates fell in 2022 and 2023 for homeowners with mortgages, as market rates rose. We observe both absolute declines and declines relative to homeowners without mortgages, who are unaffected by mortgage rate lock. Mobility declines are not explained by changes in home values. Overall, our estimates imply that rising interest rates reduced mobility in 2022 and 2023 for households with mortgages by 16% and caused $20 billion of deadweight loss.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32781,32781,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024

Banks, but not industrial firms, have consistently lower payouts in times of high regulation uncertainty and under democratic presidents. After the Global Financial Crisis, bank regulators’ influence on payout policies of the largest banks increases sharply and repurchases become more important than dividends for these banks.

Proximity to Abortion Services and Child Maltreatment,"Erkmen G.

The analysis reveals that a rise in travel distance to the nearest abortion facility significantly increases the incidence of child maltreatment. Specifically, we find that a 100-mile increase in travel distance was associated with a 21.7% increase in maltreatment reports. This effect is particularly pronounced for very young children, non-White children, and those living in economically disadvantaged, racially diverse, and rural areas. Furthermore, supplemental analyses using data from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) and county-level eviction records for renting households reveal economic stability and housing security as significant mediators linking barriers to abortion services to an increased risk of maltreatment.

Who Benefited from World War II Service and the GI Bill? New Evidence on Heterogeneous Effects for US Veterans,William J. Collins & Ariell Zimran,"We study the impacts of WWII service and access to GI Bill benefits on the educational and labor market outcomes of individuals of various ethnic and racial groups.  We address selection into military service directly by linking veterans and nonveterans from 1950’s census records to the complete-count 1940 census.  We find that veterans were positively selected on the basis of education, and neutrally or negatively selected on the basis of their own or their fathers’ labor market characteristics.  We show that selection can be dramatically reduced by using 1940 controls.  Controlling for these characteristics, we find modest positive impacts in 1950 of WWII service and the GI Bill on educational attainment of those with the least pre-war education, and on the school attendance of those with the most pre-war education, with no effect evident for college completion.  These effects are relatively large for black men.  We find mixed effects on labor market outcomes: young veterans enjoyed slight gains in income and occupational status; older veterans did not.  We do not find systematic racial or ethnic differences in labor market impacts.  These findings are important given the continued salience of the GI Bill and its potentially disparate outcomes in political discourse.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32774,32774,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024

We examine the aggregate labor market impact of labor unions, the causes of their decline, and their welfare and distributional consequences, accounting for unions’ effects on wages and employers’ insurance provisions. We first provide descriptive evidence that social insurance expansions contribute to the union’s decline. We then develop and estimate an equilibrium labor search model where unionization, wages, employers’ insurance provisions, and job security are endogenously determined. We find that, while skill-biased technological changes and Right-to-Work laws respectively explain 32% and 7% of the union decline from 1955 to 2019, social insurance expansions account for 15%. Our analysis also indicates that social insurance expansion can affect inequality through (de)unionization, and inequality may increase or decrease depending on how social insurance is targeted.

Partisan alignment between individuals explains team and financial relationship formation, with initial evidence suggesting that high levels of partisan homogeneity may be associated with economic costs. We conclude by proposing several promising directions for future research.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32792,32792,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Employment and Community: Socioeconomic Cooperation and Its Breakdown,Daron Acemoglu & Alexander Wolitzky,"We propose a model of the interplay of employment relationships and community-based interactions among workers and managers. Employment relations can be either tough (where workers are monitored intensively and obtain few rents, and managers do not provide informal favors for their workers) or soft (where there is less monitoring, more worker rents, and more workplace favor exchange). Both workers and managers also exert effort in providing community benefits. The threat of losing access to community benefits can motivate managers to keep employment soft; conversely, the threat of losing future employment or future workers' trust can motivate workers and managers to exert effort in the community. Improvements in monitoring technologies; automation, outsourcing, and offshoring; declines in the minimum wage; and opportunities for residential segregation or for privatizing community-provided services can make both workers and managers worse-off by undermining soft employment relations and community cooperation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32773,32773,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
The Effect of New Information Technologies on Asset Pricing Anomalies,David Hirshleifer & Liang Ma,"We test and compare the effects of introduction of two new financial information technologies, EDGAR and XBRL, on well-known asset pricing anomalies often attributed to mispricing. EDGAR facilitates easier access to public accounting information about public firms;  XBRL reduces the cost of processing such information. Using stacked difference-in-differences regressions, we find that both EDGAR and XBRL reduce mispricing for accounting-based anomalies but not for non-accounting-based anomalies. The economic magnitudes of the effects on accounting-based anomalies are similar for  EDGAR and XBRL. These results suggest that both easier access to and less costly processing of public information enhance market efficiency.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32767,32767,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Constructing BEA Highways and Streets Net Wealth Stocks with Detailed Types of Investment and Engineering-based Estimates of Depreciation,Barbara M. Fraumeni & Robert Kornfeld,"This paper builds on a previous paper by the authors (Kornfeld and Fraumeni, 2022) that primarily used U.S. Federal Highway Administration Highway Statistics data to disaggregate investment in highways and streets into more detailed types to produce updated estimates of net wealth stocks and depreciation. In this paper, major components of highways and streets other than pavement:  grading, bridges and other structures, traffic management, safety, and environmental, are set equal to comprehensive revision updated versions of those derived in the earlier paper.  All capital outlays, including those for pavement, and non-pavement net wealth stocks, are controlled to current BEA estimates. The engineering-based depreciation patterns are very dissimilar to the BEA patterns.  The engineering-based net wealth pavement stock depreciation patterns fall from an efficiency level of about 0.055 to zero after 20 years of life; the BEA Hulten-Wykoff-based net wealth pavement stock depreciation patterns are at approximately the same efficiency level after 62 years, with a positive efficiency level continuing to infinity. BEA adopted Hulten-Wykoff default depreciation rates in the absence of other information (Fraumeni, 1997), however research by Fraumeni established engineering-based Picher pavement depreciation rates for highways and streets (Fraumeni, 1999, 2007).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32753,32753,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Innovation Adoption by Committee: Evaluating Decision-Making in the FDA,Nathan J.

First Do No Harm? Doctor Decision Making and Patient Outcomes,"Janet Currie, W. Bentley MacLeod & Kate Musen","Doctors facing similar patients often make different treatment choices. These decisions can have important effects on patient health and health care spending. This paper seeks to organize the recent economics literature on physician decision making using a simple model that incorporates doctor diagnostic and procedural skills, differences in beliefs and patient populations, and incentives. Economic considerations that affect the quality of decision making include training, experience, peer effects, financial incentives and time constraints. We also consider interventions aimed at improving decision making including provision of informational, heuristics and guidelines, and the use of technologies including electronic medical records and algorithmic decision tools. Our review suggests that we have learned a great deal about specific factors that influence doctor decision making but that our knowledge of how to apply that knowledge to improve health care is still quite limited.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32788,32788,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Privatization's Impacts on State-Owned Enterprises: A Tale of Zombie versus Healthy Firms,"Ruiting Wang, Xue Wang, Gang Xu & Tao Zha","We estimate the effects of privatization on zombie versus healthy state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China, extending our analysis beyond TFP to a broad array of financial and economic indicators. Privatizing zombie SOEs enhances labor productivity and TFP, reduces bank and government subsidies, alleviates leverage and administrative expenses, improves liquidity, boosts profits, and accelerates sales growth. These benefits are more pronounced than for healthy SOEs and are robust across regions and industries. Our findings offer policy implications for emerging markets, suggesting that prioritizing the privatization of underperforming, zombie-like entities can lead to substantial economic improvements and greater efficiency.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32795,32795,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Accounting for Nonresponse in Election Polls: Total Margin of Error,Jeff Dominitz & Charles F. Manski,"The potential impact of nonresponse on election polls is well known and frequently acknowledged. Yet measurement and reporting of polling error has focused solely on sampling error, represented by the margin of error of a poll. Survey statisticians have long recommended measurement of the total survey error of a sample estimate by its mean square error (MSE), which jointly measures sampling and non-sampling errors. Extending the conventional language of polling, we think it reasonable to use the square root of maximum MSE to measure the total margin of error. This paper demonstrates how to measure the potential impact of nonresponse using the concept of the total margin of error, which we argue should be a standard feature in the reporting of election poll results. We first show how to jointly measure statistical imprecision and response bias when a pollster lacks any knowledge of the candidate preferences of non-responders. We then extend the analysis to settings where the pollster has partial knowledge that bounds the preferences of non-responders.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32782,32782,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Unconditional Cash Transfers: A Bayesian Meta-Analysis of Randomized Evaluations in Low and Middle Income Countries,"Tommaso Crosta, Dean Karlan, Finley Ong, Julius Rüschenpöhler & Christopher R. Udry","We use Bayesian meta-analysis methods to estimate the impact of unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) on twelve primary outcomes from 114 studies of 72 UCT programs in middle and low income countries. Cash transfers generate strong and positive average treatment effects on ten of thirteen outcomes: monthly household total and food consumption, monthly income, labor supply, school enrollment, food security, psychological well-being, total assets, financial assets, and children height-for-age. The three remaining outcomes have prediction intervals mostly positive, but that include zero: number of hours worked, children weight-for-age, and stunting. We draw six conclusions: First, consistent with several models of capital market failures, households consume more of streams and invest more of lump sums, however once stream programs end the impacts mirror those of lump sum, indicating some propensity to save a portion of stream transfers. Second, long-run treatment effects remain broadly strong, with some evidence of lump sums modestly dissipating impact while ongoing streams augmenting impact. Third, returns are linear or slightly negative with respect to grant amount, thus we do not find evidence for threshold-based poverty traps within the observed range of transfers and with this study-level analytical method. Fourth, effects on consumption and income are greater for UCTs targeted to women. Fifth, programs employing light-touch framing related to child welfare or food security have weakly stronger impacts. Sixth, positive impacts on labor supply and income suggest no evidence of “dependency” theories that cash transfers demotivate income-generating activity on average.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32779,32779,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024

Horton, Elizabeth Kerschner, Thu Minh Kha, Alan Potter, Daniel Schmidutz, Kristin Skogstrand, Aijing Sun, Luzia Weiss, Mark H. Wener & Axel H. Börsch-Supan et al. (View all)","SHARE, the “Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe”, is a large population-based panel survey among people aged 50 and over with data from 28 European countries and Israel. It investigates individual, economic, health-related, and social life-course circumstances in order to shed light on the challenges of population aging for individuals and society as a whole. Understanding aging per se, and how we age differently over the life course given our individual backgrounds, current health, and socio-economic factors, are the aims of SHARE.
In order to maintain intertemporal, international and intercultural comparability, SHARE has adopted collection of objective data in the health domain. SHARE measures physical performance, such as grip strength, peak expiratory flow, walking speed, chair stand, word recall, and Euro-D depression among others in the physical, cognitive and mental health modules. In 2015, SHARE collected dried blood spot (DBS) samples as an additional objective measure of health. Eleven European countries and Israel participated in the DBS collection. The collection was harmonized in terms of designing documents, gaining consent, procuring blood-collection material, and training interviewers how to collect DBS samples while observing the national ethic and administrative regulations in all countries. Altogether, approximately 27,200 respondents consented, resulting in an overall participation rate of 67% with considerable differences between countries and interviewers.
This report describes the carefully monitored processes of gaining consent for DBS collection and for the implementation, collection and evaluation of the to-date largest DBS-based study of a representative adult population in Europe. We also describe the choice of blood biomarkers, the assays employed to determine the blood biomarker concentrations in DBS collected in the home of survey respondents and the validation and adjustment of the laboratory results for the impact of sample collection in a non-medical environment. Finally, we present the data obtained for seven out of 17 blood biomarkers. The data for the remaining ten biomarkers analyzed at the Statens Serum Institut will follow in a separate release.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32764,32764,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Estimating the Value of Offsite Tracking Data to Advertisers: Evidence from Meta,"Nils Wernerfelt, Anna Tuchman, Bradley Shapiro & Robert Moakler","Third-party cookies and related ‘offsite’ tracking technologies are frequently used to share user data across applications in support of ad delivery. These data are viewed as highly valuable for online advertisers, but their usage faces increasing headwinds. In this paper, we quantify the benefit to advertisers from using such offsite tracking data in their ad delivery. With this goal in mind, we conduct a large-scale, randomized experiment that includes more than 70,000 advertisers on Facebook and Instagram. We first estimate advertising effectiveness at baseline across our broad sample. We then estimate the change in effectiveness of the same campaigns were advertisers to lose the ability to optimize ad delivery with offsite data. In each of these cases, we use recently developed deconvolution techniques to flexibly estimate the underlying distribution of effects. We find a median cost per incremental customer at baseline of $38.16 that under the median loss in effectiveness would rise to $49.93, a 31% increase. Further, we find ads targeted using offsite data generate more long-term customers per dollar than those without, and losing offsite data disproportionately hurts small scale advertisers. Taken together, our results suggest that offsite data bring large benefits to a wide range of advertisers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32765,32765,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
The Returns to Skills During the Pandemic: Experimental Evidence from Uganda,"Livia Alfonsi, Vittorio Bassi, Imran Rasul & Elena Spadini","The Covid-19 pandemic represents one of the most significant labor market shocks to the world economy in recent times. We present evidence from a field experiment to understand whether and why skilled and unskilled workers were differentially impacted by the shock, in the context of a low-income economy, Uganda. We leverage a panel of workers and firms, tracked from 2012 to 2022, including high frequency surveys over the pandemic. In 2013, workers were randomly assigned to receive six months of sector-specific vocational training, in one of eight high productivity sectors. We document that over the pandemic, employment and earnings margins follow V-shaped dynamics, whereby the outcomes of treated (skilled) workers are more severely impacted by lockdowns, they recover more quickly between lockdowns, and remain resilient to the shock as the economy recovers. Cumulatively over the pandemic, skilled workers spend 61% more time than controls employed in one of our study sectors, and their total earnings are 17% higher. We explore supply- and demand-side mechanisms through which the returns to skills are maintained through the crisis. We document that skilled workers are more exposed to the shock because they are more likely to be laid off during the first lockdown as firms respond to the rapid, severe and uncertain shock by immediately laying off higher earning workers. However, skilled workers recover quickly because of their greater accumulation of sector-specific experience pre-pandemic, and the certifiability of their skills that allows them to switch employers in the same sector during the crisis. Our findings have implications for understanding the returns to skills acquired through vocational training in good economic times and times of crisis.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32785,32785,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024

Contracting over Pharmaceutical Formularies and Rebates,Kate Ho & Robin S. Lee,"We investigate how formularies used by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) can affect manufacturer rebates for branded drugs. We first present a theoretical model of multidimensional contracting in which a PBM negotiates with drug manufacturers over menus of formulary-contingent rebate payments and then selects a formulary. We then estimate how formulary placement affects drug demand for statins using data from Princeton University, a large employer that contracts with a single PBM to offer prescription drug coverage to its employees. Using our theoretical model and demand estimates, we predict how rebates are affected by the use of a preferred tier in the formulary or the ability to exclude a drug from coverage. Our predictions align with aggregate rebate data, and we find that allowing a PBM to place branded drugs on preferred and non-preferred tiers can substantially increase negotiated rebate payments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32790,32790,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Social Interaction Intensity and Investor Behavior,"Michael Gelman, David Hirshleifer, Yaron Levi & Liron Reiter-Gavish","We document a causal effect of social interactions on investor behavior using the number of local soccer games as a measure of social interaction intensity. Social transmission is identifiable in buy but not sell trades. The effect of  Social Interaction Intensity (SII) on the sensitivity of buying to past buys is greater for riskier and high-return stocks. Social interactions cause an extremity shift wherein existing shareholders increase their positions, especially within demographically homogeneous communities. There is suggestive evidence that investor mood may modulate the effectiveness of transmission. Higher social interaction intensity increases the sensitivity of investors' trading volume, and portfolio riskiness to past trades. SII also increases the sensitivity of stock trading volume and retail ownership percentage to past buys.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32772,32772,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Understanding Korea’s Long-Run Real Exchange Rate Behavior,Douglas A. Irwin & Maurice Obstfeld,"Korea’s real exchange rate has displayed a mild downward trend since the 1980s, with fluctuations of ±20 percent around that trend. This pattern is surprising because the classic Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson framework suggests that countries experiencing rapid growth in the productivity of their tradable industries should experience real currency appreciation over time. We decompose the sources of change behind the Korean won’s real exchange rate into internal price drivers (the relative price of nontradable goods) and external price drivers (the international relative price of tradable consumption goods, which is heavily dependent on the nominal exchange rate). We find that, on average, the variability in Korea’s real exchange rate, even over long periods, is overwhelmingly due to external price factors. Given the persistent medium-term effects of nominal exchange rate changes on the real exchange rate, the Korean policy of intervening in foreign exchange markets to smooth exchange rate fluctuations appears prudent. However, we also find that over the entire period 1985-2023, internal price factors are the main explanator of the won’s real depreciation. This finding poses a puzzle for standard accounts of the linkage between productivity growth and real exchange rates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32769,32769,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
The Fiscal Contract up Close: Experimental Evidence from Mexico City,"Anne Brockmeyer, Francisco Garfias & Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato","Can the provision of public goods strengthen the fiscal capacity of governments in developing countries and move them toward an equilibrium of widespread tax compliance? We present evidence of the impact of local public infrastructure on tax compliance, leveraging a large public investment experiment and individual property tax records from Mexico City. Despite the salience and large effects of these investments on access to infrastructure, property values, and local economic development, we find no changes in property tax compliance and can rule out even small increases.

We find the equilibrium number of signatory countries to be higher than when preferences are time consistent, especially when the political environment is unstable and polarized, and the international spillovers are limited. In contrast to the traditional literature, the model can also explain why countries sign conventions with mandates that do not vary with the coalition size.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32780,32780,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Driving the Gig Economy,"Katharine G. Abraham, John C. Haltiwanger, Claire Y. Hou, Kristin Sandusky & James Spletzer","Using rich administrative tax data, we explore the effects of the introduction of online ridesharing platforms on entry, employment and earnings in the Taxi and Limousine Services industry. Ridesharing dramatically increased the pace of entry of workers into the industry. New entrants were more likely to be young, female, White and U.S. born, and to combine earnings from ridesharing with wage and salary earnings. Displaced workers have found ridesharing to be a substantially more attractive fallback option than driving a taxi. Ridesharing also affected the incumbent taxi driver workforce. The exit rates of low-earning taxi drivers increased following the introduction of ridesharing in their city; exit rates of high-earning taxi drivers were little affected. In cities without regulations limiting the size of the taxi fleet, both groups of drivers experienced earnings losses following the introduction of ridesharing. These losses were ameliorated or absent in more heavily regulated markets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32766,32766,24-Aug,NBER,8/5/2024
Explaining the Great Moderation Exchange Rate Volatility Puzzle,"Vania Stavrakeva, Jenny Tang","In this paper, we study how the volatility of both realized and expected macroeconomic variables relates to the variation in exchange rate volatility through the prism of the Great Moderation hypothesis. We find significant heterogeneity in exchange rate trend volatility across currency pairs despite decreases in the volatility of expected future interest rate differentials and of realized yields themselves. We argue that time
variation in the relationship between macroeconomic variables and exchange rates has prevented the Great Moderation in realized yield volatility from translating to a decrease in exchange rate volatility. Considering a Campbell-Shiller-type decomposition of exchange rate changes into forward-looking components linked to inflation, policy rate, and currency risk premia expectations, we find that the Great Moderation in volatility of expected yield differentials cannot explain the patterns in exchange rate volatility we observe. The main drivers of these patterns were trends in the volatility of the currency risk premium component and in the covariance between the components capturing the strength of the Fama puzzle and the expected responsiveness of monetary policy to inflation.",https://www.bostonfed.org//publications/research-department-working-paper/2024/explaining-the-great-moderation-exchange-rate-volatility-puzzle,24-9,8/5/2024,FED-BOSTON,8/6/2024

Second, we discuss how the recent inflationary episode has contributed to redistributing real resources from holders of government debt to the public purse. In particular, financial prices before the onset of the Covid pandemic suggest that investors viewed an inflationary shock such as the one we experienced as extremely unlikely, so the magnitude of this redistribution caught them by surprise.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-15,2024-15,24-Aug,FED-CHICAGO,8/7/2024
Regulating Decentralized Systems: Evidence from Sanctions on Tornado Cash,"Anders Brownworth, Jon Durfee, Michael Junho Lee, and Antoine Martin","Blockchain-based systems are run by a decentralized network of participants and are designed to be censorship-resistant. We use sanctions imposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury on Tornado Cash (TC), a smart contract protocol, to study the impact and effectiveness of regulation in decentralized systems. We document an immediate and lasting impact on TC following the sanction announcement, measured by market reaction, transaction volume, and diversity of users. Still, net flows into TC contracts recover to and surpass pre-announcement levels for most pools, supporting viability of TC. Evidence on cooperation at the settlement layer is mixed: the aggregate share of non-cooperative blocks increases over time, but a shrinking number of actors process Tornado Cash transactions, indicating a fragility to the sustainability of censorship-resistance. Non-cooperation is not explained by tokenomics, and changes in perception around legal authority and clarity of regulation appears to be a key factor for whether to cooperate.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1112,1112,8/6/2024,FED-NEWYORK,8/8/2024

ECB Spillovers to Emerging Europe: The Past and Current Experience,Philipp Engler ; Gianluigi Ferrucci ; Pawel Zabczyk ; Tianxiao Zheng,"We provide new evidence on the spillover effects of ECB monetary policy shocks to emerging European economies, using a combination of empirical methods and model-based simulations and focusing on spillovers from interest rate and balance sheet policies implemented by the ECB. We consider an event study set around the ECB policy announcement in June 2022 and also use local projections to estimate regional spillovers in a panel of 16 Emerging European countries spanning 1999 to 2022. Identifying ECB monetary policy shocks as the unexplained component of changes in the three-month Euribor futures rate, we find that ECB monetary policy tightening induces more than one-for-one changes in government bond yields in Emerging Europe, as well as sizable increases in sovereign spreads, domestic currency depreciations, and significantly lower output. Model simulations using a two-country DSGE calibrated to the euro area and its Eastern European neighbors reveal that a conventional tightening, achieved through interest rate increases, provides a more favorable inflation-output trade-off compared to balance sheet tightenings. The extent of spillovers from quantitative tightening depends on the speed of balance sheet reduction, and it is larger under a fixed exchange rate regime.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/09/ECB-Spillovers-to-Emerging-Europe-The-Past-and-Current-Experience-553162,2024-170,"Fri, 09 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/10/2024
The Joint Effect of Emigration and Remittances on Economic Growth and Labor Force Participation in Latin America and the Caribbean,Alina Carare ; Alejandro Fiorito Baratas ; Jessie Kilembe ; Metodij Hadzi-Vaskov ; Wenzhang Zhang,"We provide a consistent empirical framework to estimate the net joint effect of emigration and remittances on the migrants’ countries of origin key economic variables (GDP growth and labor force participation), while addressing the endogeneity concerns using novel “shift-share” instrumental variables in the spirit of Anelli and others (2023). Understanding this joint impact is crucial for the Latin America and the Caribbean region that has seen a continuous growth in remittances over the past decades, due to steady emigration, and where remittances represent the largest capital inflows for many countries now. Focusing on the past two decades (1999-2019), this study finds that on average emigration has a negative and statistically significant impact on contemporaneous economic growth and change in labor force participation in the countries of origin across LAC, while remittances partially mitigate this adverse impact—especially on economic growth—resulting in a small negative net joint effect. There are significant differences across subregions for all estimates, with the largest negative effects observed in the Caribbean. In addition, the negative impact of emigration and remittances on the change in labor participation is small, but for the youngest cohort (15-24) is twice as large as for the overall labor force participation. The results are robust to various specifications, variables, and measurements of emigration and remittances.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/09/The-Joint-Effect-of-Emigration-and-Remittances-on-Economic-Growth-and-Labor-Force-553159,2024-175,"Fri, 09 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/10/2024
Quantitative easing and quantitative tightening: the money channel,Michael Kumhof and Mauricio Salgado-Moreno,"We develop a DSGE model in which commercial banks interact with the central bank through
the reserves market, with each other through reserves and interbank markets, and with
the real economy through retail loan and deposit markets. Because banks disburse loans
through deposit creation, they never face financing risks (being unable to fund new loans),
only refinancing risks (being unable to settle net deposit withdrawals in reserves). Permanent
quantitative tightening, while reducing the equilibrium real interest rate, has significant
negative effects on financial and real variables, by increasing the cost at which
reserves-scarce parts of the banking sector create money. Temporary net deposit
withdrawals, which affect the funding cost and loan extension of one part of the banking
sector at the expense of another part, have highly asymmetric financial and real effects. The
quantity and distribution of central bank reserves, and the extent of frictions in the interbank
and reserves markets, critically affect the size of these effects, and can matter even in a
regime of ample aggregate reserves. Countercyclical reserve injections can help to smooth
the business cycle. We find that countercyclical reserve quantity rules can make sizeable
contributions to welfare that can reach a similar size to the Taylor rule.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/quantitative-easing-and-quantitative-tightening-the-money-channel,1090,"Fri, 09 Aug 2024 ",BOE,8/10/2024

Using examples from the literature, we provide practical guidance on how to use these data to construct economic measures of borrowing, consumption, credit access, financial distress, and geographic mobility. We explain what credit scores measure, and why. We highlight how researchers can access credit reporting data via existing datasets or by creating new datasets, including by linking credit reporting data with surveys and external datasets.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1114,1114,8/9/2024,FED-NEWYORK,8/10/2024
Inflation Expectations with Finite Horizon Planning,"Christopher Gust, Edward Herbst, and David Lopez-Salido","Under finite horizon planning, households and firms evaluate a full set of state-contingent paths along which the economy might evolve out to a finite horizon but have limited ability to process events beyond that horizon. We show–analytically and empirically–that such a model accounts for an initial underreaction and subsequent overreaction of inflation forecasts. A planning horizon of four quarters can account for the evidence on the predictability of inflation forecast errors and macroeconomic data. Our identification and estimation strategies combine full-information methods based on aggregate data with regression-based estimates that directly use inflation expectations data.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/inflation-expectations-with-finite-horizon-planning.htm,2024-063,24-Aug,FED-BOARD,8/10/2024
Fiscal R-Star: Fiscal-Monetary Tensions and Implications for Policy,Marijn A. Bolhuis ; Jakree Koosakul ; Neil Shenai,"Since the Global Financial Crisis, fiscal policy in advanced economies has become more “active” – that is, increasingly unresponsive to rising debt levels. This paper explores tensions between active fiscal and monetary policies by introducing the concept of “fiscal r-star,” which is the real interest rate required to stabilize debt levels when the primary balance is set exogenously, output is growing at potential, and inflation is at target. It is proposed that the difference between monetary r-star and fiscal r-star—referred to as the “fiscal monetary gap”—is a proxy for fiscal-monetary policy tensions. An analysis of over 140 years of data from 16 advanced economies shows that larger fiscal-monetary gaps are associated with rising debt levels, higher inflation, financial repression, lower real returns on bonds and cash, with elevated risks of future debt, inflation, currency, housing, and systemic crises. Current estimates indicate that fiscal-monetary tensions are at historic highs. Given the tepid growth outlook, growth-enhancing reforms and fiscal consolidation, among other policy adjustments, may be needed to attenuate fiscal-monetary tensions over time.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/09/Fiscal-R-Star-Fiscal-Monetary-Tensions-and-Implications-for-Policy-552877,2024-174,"Fri, 09 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/10/2024
The Role of IMF Arrangements in Restoring Access to International Capital Markets,Joseph Kogan ; Romina Kazandjian ; Shijia Luo ; Moustapha Mbohou ; Hui Miao,"Using a database of emerging market fundamentals and bond index spreads across 56 frontier and emerging market countries rated below investment grade during the period 2002-22, we assess whether IMF arrangements can restore access to international capital markets (ICM) for countries in distress through liquidity and conditionality channels. We find that global financial conditions and debt/GDP are the most important determinants of access to ICM within the horizon of a typical IMF arrangement. Using an event study methodology, we show that spreads increase prior to the start of an IMF arrangement and then decrease gradually. By exploiting different characteristics of IMF arrangements, we find evidence that the reforms implemented under the IMF arrangement, as measured by rounds of successful IMF reviews, matter more in the medium term than the IMF’s role as a liquidity provider. These results are consistent with our analysis of 55 credit rating upgrades to ICM access levels, which suggests that debt reduction plays the largest role and that IMF arrangements lend credibility to reforms.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/09/The-Role-of-IMF-Arrangements-in-Restoring-Access-to-International-Capital-Markets-553156,2024-173,"Fri, 09 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/10/2024
"Supply-Side Drug Policy, Polydrug Use, and the Economic Effects of Withdrawal Symptoms",Alexander Ahammer & Analisa Packham,"Despite the fact that 30 percent of opioid overdoses also involve a benzodiazepine, there is little policy guidance on how to curb concurrent misuse and even less evidence on how changes to co-prescribing practices can affect patients' economic trajectories. In 2012, Austria restricted access to flunitrazepam, one of the most potent, and most heavily misused, benzodiazepines. We use linked individual-level data to identify opioid users and estimate the reform's impact on their health and labor market outcomes relative to a randomly selected comparison group of non-opioid users. Estimates indicate a 12.7 percent drop in employment, a 13.1 percent increase in unemployment insurance claims, and a 26.5 percent increase in overall healthcare expenditures. We provide suggestive evidence that these effects are due to incapacitating withdrawal symptoms, rather than substitution to other drugs, including heroin or alcohol.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32804,32804,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
"Urban roadway in America: the amount, extent, and value","Erick Guerra, Gilles Duranton & Xinyu Ma","We predict the amount, share, and value of land dedicated to roadways within and across 316 US Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas. Despite the amount and value of land dedicated to roadway, our study provides the first such estimate across a broad range of metropolitan areas. Our basic approach is to estimate roadway widths using a 10% sample of widths provided by the Highway Performance and Monitoring System and apply our estimates to the rest of the roadway system. Multiplying estimated widths by segment length and netting out double counting at intersections provide estimates of land area. We also match roadway segments and areas to existing land value estimates and satellite-based measures of urbanized land. We find that a little under a quarter of urbanized land—roughly the size of West Virginia—is dedicated to roadway. This land was worth around $4.1 trillion dollars in 2016 and had an annualized value that was higher than the total variable costs of the trucking sector and the total annual federal, state, and local expenditures on roadway. Conducting a back-of-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis, we found that the country likely has too much land dedicated to urban roads.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32824,32824,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Pension Reforms and Inequality in Germany: Micro-Modelling,"Axel H. Börsch-Supan, Johannes Rausch & Luca Salerno","Germany, like many other countries, has undergone a series of pension reforms since the 1980s which generally decreased benefit generosity and increased the retirement age due to demographic pressures. This paper investigates whether these reforms have increased income and wealth inequality among retirees. In order to answer this question, we employed counterfactual simulations in which we predict how the income and social security wealth distributions would have developed if these reforms had not taken place, compared to the actual development of the income and social security wealth distributions.
Our analysis reveals that the pension reforms has led to an increase in inequality in terms of social security wealth between the 1990s and 2000s and decreased inequality thereafter. The decrease in inequality is mainly driven by social assistance as it represents a lower bound for benefit size and thus mitigates the effect of benefit-reducing reforms for lower income groups. We further divided the total effect of the pension reforms into two components. The first component is the mechanical effect, which keeps retirement probabilities constant and only considers changes in benefit calculation. The second component is the behavioral effect, which describes how SSW differs because of altered retirement probabilities. Our findings indicate that in the German context the behavioral effect is statistically significant but economically small.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32796,32796,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Racial Housing Price Differentials and Neighborhood Segregation,Sebastien Box-Couillard & Peter Christensen,"We report evidence from the largest study of racial price differentials in the U.S. housing market, using a panel of 40 million repeat-sales transactions. We find
that price premiums facing Black and Hispanic homebuyers are ubiquitous and systematically higher in neighborhoods with a larger share of non-white residents.
We find that non-white buyers purchase at a premium when buying from sellers from outside their group. Consistent with predictions from theoretical models, we find higher premiums in supply-constrained markets. Leveraging exogenous variation in racial segregation, we find that racial segregation leads to larger price premiums paid by Black homebuyers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32815,32815,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Misreporting in the Norwegian Business Cash Support Scheme,"Dinara Alpysbayeva, Annette Alstadsæter, Wojciech Kopczuk, Simen Markussen & Oddbjorn Raaum","We analyze the reporting response to an ambitiously targeted government support scheme for Norwegian businesses at the very start of the Coronavirus crisis
in 2020. Our empirical design is based on cross-checking self-reported data in the applications for support with administratively reported data used for VAT. We
find strong evidence that strategic misreporting was present but conclude that its remaining quantitative extent after enforcement actions already taken by the tax authorities was relatively small. Firms tend to misreport 4 percent more often than expected, and the actual support paid out was 5 percent higher than it should have been.

Unequal Uptake: Assessing Distributional Disparities in the Residential Solar Market,Jackson Dorsey & Derek C. Wolfson,"We examine technology adoption and consumer welfare disparities across demographic groups using data from an online solar photovoltaic (PV) marketplace. Low-income households are 25% less likely to purchase solar through the platform and obtain 53% lower expected consumer surplus than high-income households. Moreover, Black and Hispanic households are relatively less likely to purchase solar through the platform and obtain lower consumer surplus than White and Asian households. We develop a method to decompose the drivers of consumer welfare disparities between demographic groups. Differences in demand fully account for the consumer surplus disparities between high- and low-income households and between White and Hispanic households. However, supply-side factors explain 37% of the consumer surplus gap between White and Black households. Black households get relatively fewer bids and face higher prices, and installers have higher implied costs to serve them. Lastly, we assess counterfactuals that offer targeted price discounts to certain demographic groups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32814,32814,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
"Exchange Rate Models are Better than You Think, and Why They Didn't Work in the Old Days",Charles Engel & Steve P.Y. Wu,"Exchange-rate models fit very well for the U.S. dollar in the 21st century. A “standard” model that includes real interest rates and a measure of expected inflation for the U.S. and the foreign country, the U.S. comprehensive trade balance, and measures of global risk and liquidity demand is well-supported in the data for the U.S. against other G10 currencies. The monetary and non-monetary variables play equally important roles in explaining exchange rate movements. In the 1970s – early 1990s, the fit of the model was poor but the fit (as measured by t- and F-statistics, and R-squareds) has increased almost monotonically to the present day. We make the case that it is better monetary policy (inflation targeting) that has led to the improvement, as the scope for self-fulfilling expectations has disappeared. We provide a variety of evidence that links changes in monetary policy to the performance of the exchange-rate model.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32808,32808,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Sabotage as Industrial Policy,"Jin Liu, Martin Rotemberg & Sharon Traiberman","We characterize sabotage, exemplified by recent U.S. policies concerning China's semiconductor industry, as trade policy. For some (but not all) goods, completely destroying foreigners’ productivity increases domestic real income by shifting the location of production and improving the terms of trade. The gross benefit of sabotage can be summarized by a few sufficient statistics: trade and demand elasticities and import and production shares. The cost of sabotage is determined by countries' relative unit labor costs for the sabotaged goods. We find important non-monotinicities: for semi-conductors, partially sabotaging foreign production would lower US real income, while comprehensive sabotage would raise it.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32798,32798,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Bilateral Economies of Scope,"Yao Amber Li, Sichuang Xu, Stephen Yeaple & Tengyu Zhao","International transactions are costly because they require investments in logistics, contracts, and the acquisition of local institutional knowledge.

Using dis-aggregated transactions data for Chinese firms from 2000 to 2015, we document firm-level trading patterns that suggest such market-specific bilateral economies of scope. Using a structural model, we estimate that the simultaneous export and import in a given country reduces export and import fixed costs by over 41 and 37 percent, respectively.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32803,32803,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Dynamic Optimization Meets Budgeting: Unraveling Financial Complexities,Guidon Fenig & Luba Petersen,"This paper explores sources of complexity in dynamic optimization, examining how individuals navigate variation in incomes, prices, and returns in ten-period consumption-saving decisions.  Our findings reveal that dynamic optimization poses significant challenges, resulting in suboptimal choices even in straightforward scenarios with stable parameters, full information, no uncertainty, and opportunities to learn. These challenges intensify in scenarios involving complexities such as inflation and compounding returns, marked by a pronounced tendency to over-smooth consumption.
Additionally, we introduce a novel budgeting calculator designed to assist with consumption planning and to collect valuable non-choice data on subjects' planning strategies and horizons—an approach not previously utilized in studies of dynamic optimization. We observe significant heterogeneity in planning horizons and ability to optimize given a chosen horizon. Complete planning leads to better performance in more complex scenarios, even when people do not optimally utilize the calculator.  However, there is little reoptimization after the first period and participants tend to stick with suboptimal plans for most of their life cycle. The decision to plan is less influenced by the complexity of the economic environment and more by the length of the planning horizon.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32821,32821,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Local Projections,Òscar Jordà & Alan M. Taylor,"A central question in applied research is to estimate the effect of an exogenous intervention or shock on an outcome.

We adapt theories of expected utility maximization and ambiguity aversion to characterize the planner's objective, which results in welfarist criteria similar to social welfare functions, with intrapersonal frames replacing interpersonal types. Under paternalistic risk aversion or ambiguity aversion, a policy is less desirable to the planner, holding all else fixed, when it leads to more disagreement about welfare from revealed preferences. We map some examples of behavioral models into our framework and describe how this notion of robustness plays out in applied settings.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32813,32813,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Personal Bankruptcy Law and Innovation around the World,"Douglas Cumming, Randall Morck, Zhao Rong & Minjie Zhang","Because corporate limited liability prevents creditors from founder’s personal assets, creditors often require founders of new, small and risky firms to contract around limited liability by pledging their personal assets as collateral for loans to their firms. This makes personal bankruptcy law (PBL) relevant to corporate finance. We find that pro-debtor PBL reforms increase the number of patents filed, citations to those patents, and début patents by firms with no previous patents. These reforms also redistribute innovation across industries in closer alignment to its distribution in the U.S., which we take to approximate industry innovative potential. These effects are driven by firms without histories of high-intensity patenting, and are damped in countries that impose minimum capital requirements on new firms. Firms with largescale legacy technology may avoid radical innovations that devalue that technology. Consequently, new, initially small and risky firms often develop the disruptive innovations that contribute most to economic growth. Consistent with this, we also find pro-debtor PBL reforms increasing value-added growth rates across all industries, and by larger margins in industries with more innovation potential. Our difference-in-differences regressions use patents and PBL reforms for 33 countries from 1990 to 2002, with subsequent years used to measure citations to patents in this period.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32826,32826,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Why Do Employers Establish Retirement Savings Plans? Evidence from State “Auto-IRA” Policies,"Adam Bloomfield, Lucas Goodman, Manita Rao & Sita Slavov","Several states have recently attempted to boost retirement saving by adopting “auto-IRA” policies that require employers not currently offering an employer-sponsored retirement plan (ESRP) to either (1) establish an ESRP or (2) enroll employees in state-facilitated Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). We identify the effect of these state retirement plan mandates on firm decisions to offer ESRPs, treating the gradual rollout of these policies across states and employer size categories as a series of “experiments.” Using U.S. tax microdata, we estimate that at least 30,000 firms have been induced to offer an ESRP by these policies, although there is substantial heterogeneity in these effects across firm and worker characteristics. This effect is large considering that, for employers, establishing and maintaining an ESRP is more costly than utilizing the state-facilitated IRAs. We explore both rational and behavioral explanations for why firms might choose the higher-cost approach to complying with auto-IRA policies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32817,32817,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Bank Lending and Deposit Crunches during the Great Depression,Kris James Mitchener & Gary Richardson,"Bank distress was a defining feature of the Great Depression in the United States. Most banks, however, weathered the storm and remained in operation throughout the contraction. We show that surviving banks cut lending when depositors withdrew funds en masse during panics.

We find that cloud computing is associated with an increase in firm entry, exit and the likelihood of M&A in industries that depend more on cloud infrastructure. Conversely, AI adoption has no impact on entry but reduces the likelihood of exit and M&A. Firm size plays a crucial role in these dynamics: cloud computing increases exit rates across all firms, while larger firms benefit from AI, experiencing reduced exit rates. Cloud computing decreases industry concentration but AI increases concentration. On the financing side, firms exposed to cloud computing increase equity and venture capital financing, while only large firms increase equity financing when exposed to AI.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32811,32811,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Relative-Price Changes as Aggregate Supply Shocks Revisited: Theory and Evidence,"Hassan Afrouzi, Saroj Bhattarai & Edson Wu","We provide theory and evidence that relative price shocks can cause aggregate inflation and act as aggregate supply shocks. Empirically, we show that exogenous positive energy price shocks have a positive impact not only on headline but also on U.S. core inflation while depressing U.S. real activity. In a two-sector monetary model with upstream and downstream sectors and heterogeneous price stickiness, we analytically characterize how upstream shocks propagate to prices. Using panel IV local projections, we show that the responsiveness of sectoral PCE prices to energy price shocks is in line with model predictions. Motivated by post-COVID inflation in the U.S., a model experiment shows that a one-time relative price shock generates persistent movements in headline and core inflation similar to those observed in the data, even in the absence of aggregate slack. The model also emphasizes that monetary policy stance plays an important role in propagation of such shocks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32816,32816,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024

Neural Network Learning for Nonlinear Economies,"Julian Ashwin, Paul Beaudry & Martin Ellison","Neural networks offer a promising tool for the analysis of nonlinear economies. In this paper, we derive conditions for the global stability of nonlinear rational expectations equilibria under neural network learning. We demonstrate the applicability of the conditions in analytical and numerical examples where the nonlinearity is caused by monetary policy targeting a range, rather than a specific value, of inflation. If shock persistence is high or there is inertia in the structure of the economy, then the only rational expectations equilibria that are learnable may involve inflation spending long periods outside its target range. Neural network learning is also useful for solving and selecting between multiple equilibria and steady states in other settings, such as when there is a zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32807,32807,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Macro-Financial Implications of the Surging Global Demand (and Supply) of International Reserves,Enrique G. Mendoza & Vincenzo Quadrini,"Research has shown that the unilateral accumulation of international reserves by a country can improve its own macro-financial stability. However, we show that when many countries accumulate reserves, the induced general equilibrium effects weaken financial and macroeconomic stability, especially for countries that do not accumulate reserves. The issuance of public debt by advanced economies has the opposite effect. We derive these results from a two-region model where private defaultable debt has a productive use. Quantitative counterfactuals show that the surge in reserves (public debt) contributed to reduce (increase) world interest rates but also to increase (reduce) private leverage. This in turn increased (decreased) volatility in both emerging and advanced economies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32810,32810,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024

Positive Incentives: The Income Effect and The Optimal Regulation of Crime,W. Bentley MacLeod & Roman Rivera,"Theories of crime in economics focus on the roles of deterrence and incapacitation in reducing criminal activity. In addition to deterrence, a growing body of empirical evidence has shown that both income support and employment subsidies can play a role in crime reduction. This paper extends the Becker-Ehrlich model to a standard labor supply model that includes the notion of a consumption need (Barzel and McDonald (1973)) highlights the role of substitution vs income effects when an individual chooses to engage in crime. Second, we show that whether the production of criminal activity is a substitute or a complement with the production of legitimate activity is central to the design of optimal policy. We find that both individual responsiveness to deterrence and optimal policy vary considerably with context, which is consistent with the large variation in the effect of deterrence on crime. Hence, optimal policy is a combination of deterrence, work subsidies and direct income transfers to the individual that vary with both income and location.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32805,32805,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Looks and Gaming: Who and Why?,"Andy Chung, Daniel S.

Average American teenagers spend 2.6% of their waking hours gaming, while for adults this figure is 2.7%. Using the American Add Health Study, we show that adults who are better-looking have more close friends. Arguably, gaming is costlier for them, and they thus engage in less of it. Physically attractive teens are less likely to engage in gaming at all, whereas unattractive teens who do game spend more time each week on it than other gamers. Attractive adults are also less likely than others to spend any time gaming; and if they do, they spend less time on it than less attractive adults. Using the longitudinal nature of the Add Health Study, we find supportive evidence that these relationships are causal for adults: good looks decrease gaming time, not vice-versa.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32809,32809,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
The Rise of Teamwork and Career Prospects in Academic Science,"Mabel Andalón, Catherine de Fontenay, Donna K. Ginther & Kwanghui Lim","Teamwork has become more important in recent decades. We show that larger teams generate an unintended side effect: individuals who finish their PhD when the average team in their field is larger have worse career prospects. Our analysis combines data on career outcomes from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients with publication data that measures team size from ISI Web of Science. As average team size in a field increased over time, junior academic scientists became less likely to secure research funding or obtain tenure and were more likely to leave academia relative to their older counterparts. The team size effect can fully account for the observed decline in tenure prospects in academic science.  The rise in team size was not associated with the end of mandatory retirement.  However, the doubling of the NIH budget was associated with a significant increase in team size.  Our results demonstrate that academic science has not adjusted its reward structure, which is largely individual, in response to team science. Failing to address these concerns means a significant loss as junior scientists exit after a costly and specialized education in science.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32827,32827,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Tax Incidence Anomalies,Youssef Benzarti,"This paper reviews the literature on the incidence of consumption and labor taxes and focuses on the empirical results that show stark departures from the canonical model of tax incidence, which I refer to as anomalies. In particular, there is mounting evidence questioning three fundamental implications of the canonical model: (1) that statutory incidence is irrelevant for economic incidence, (2) that the relative magnitude of the demand and supply elasticities is a sufficient statistic for tax incidence, and (3) that incidence is symmetric for increases and decreases. I review this empirical evidence and draw implications for the canonical model’s relevance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32819,32819,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Health Inequality and Health Types,"Margherita Borella, Francisco A. Bullano, Mariacristina De Nardi, Benjamin Krueger & Elena Manresa","While health affects many economic outcomes, its dynamics are still poorly understood. We use k means clustering, a machine learning technique, and data from the Health and Retirement Study to identify health types during middle and old age. We identify five health types: the vigorous resilient, the fair-health resilient, the fair-health vulnerable, the frail resilient, and the frail vulnerable. They are characterized by different starting health and health and mortality trajectories. Our five health types account for 84% of the variation in health trajectories and are not explained by observable characteristics, such as age, marital status, education, gender, race, health-related behaviors, and health insurance status, but rather, by one’s past health dynamics. We also show that health types are important drivers of health and mortality heterogeneity and dynamics. Our results underscore the importance of better understanding health type formation and of modeling it appropriately to properly evaluate the effects of health on people’s decisions and the implications of policy reforms.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32799,32799,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Inefficient Labor Market Sorting,Stephen Yeaple & Carsten Eckel,"A growing empirical literature attributes much of the productivity advantages of large, ""superstar"" firms to their adoption of best practice management techniques that allow them to better identify and use talented workers. The reasons for the incomplete adoption of these ""structured management practices"" (SMPs) and their welfare implications are not well understood. This paper provides a positive and normative analysis of these issues in a theoretical framework in which SMPs induce sorting of talent across firms. Incomplete adoption arises because SMPs are costly and worker talent is in limited supply. In equilibrium there is excessive adoption of SMPs and too much sorting of talented workers into large firms. In this second-best environment, policy changes that favor large firms, such as trade liberalization, have the potential to lower welfare.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32797,32797,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Measuring Potential Effects of Introducing the 2024 Race and Ethnicity Standards into the Current Population Survey,"Mark Loewenstein, David Piccone & Anne Polivka","When obtaining information on individuals’ race and ethnicity, the Current Population Survey (CPS) currently follows the 1997 OMB standards, which prescribes race and Hispanic ethnicity as distinct concepts that should be asked about in separate questions. In 2024, OMB updated the standards to stipulate that race and ethnicity be asked in one question and that a separate category be added to the single race and ethnicity question for Middle Eastern and North African. We examine the CPS microdata to tease out the effects that introduction of the 2024 standards might have on CPS labor force estimates across time. Our estimates show that individuals who indicate they are Middle Eastern or North African will likely be those who previously would have indicated that they are White, however their proportion of the population is small. In contrast, Hispanics make up a larger proportion of the population. “Other Race” responses in the CPS provide a lower bound estimate of the number of individuals who will identify as just Hispanic (Hispanic Alone) in a combined question while responses to the Hispanic ethnicity question provide an upper bound. Results from the Census Bureau’s National Content test suggest that the upper bound estimate is closer to the proportion of the population that will identify as Hispanic Alone, but there is insufficient information in the National Content test to determine how this will affect the various CPS labor force estimates. To address this issue, we calculate the labor force estimates corresponding to our lower and upper bounds However, we note that to obtain a more precise estimate of the effects changing the race and ethnicity questions on labor force estimates the two sets of questions should administered to the same respondents. One way of accomplishing this is to take advantage of the longitudinal aspect of the CPS. Individuals who initially provided their race and ethnicity using the 1997 standard questions can be asked their race and ethnicity using a combined question in subsequent months. An ongoing question is how the children of Hispanic immigrants who were born in the United States will view themselves. We therefore look at the tendency of individuals to identify as Hispanic because they were either born in a Hispanic country or were born in the U.S. but have one or two Hispanic parents.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32812,32812,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Ethnic Identity and Anti-Immigrant Sentiment: Evidence from Proposition 187,Francisca M. Antman & Brian Duncan,"Political discourse has often stoked racial and ethnic divisions, raising the possibility that individuals’ self-reported racial and ethnic identities may change in response to an increasingly hostile environment. We shed light on this question by measuring the impacts of local support for California’s Proposition 187, one of the first and most well-known ballot measures widely seen to be anti-immigrant and anti-Latino, on individuals’ willingness to identify ethnically as Hispanic and specifically, Mexican.  Linking data on self-reported ethnicity, ancestry, and parental place of birth with county-level voter support for Proposition 187, we show that individuals with stronger ties to Mexican ancestry or parentage are less likely to identify ethnically as Mexican in response to support for Proposition 187, just as individuals with weaker ties to Mexican ancestry are more likely to identify as Mexican.  This is consistent with our predictions that anti-minority sentiment may drive individuals with more observable ties to a minority group to reduce their willingness to identify due to heightened fear of discrimination and hostility.  At the same time, anti-minority sentiment may raise the salience of ethnicity and race and thus increase the willingness to identify as a minority for those with weaker observable ties, who are relatively more protected from adverse impacts. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to document a connection between political discourse and endogenous ethnic identity.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32818,32818,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Corruption as a Shared Dilemma: Survey Evidence from Legislators and Citizens in Three Countries,"Raymond Fisman, Matteo F. Ferroni & Miriam Golden","We conduct parallel surveys of legislators and citizens in three countries to study their tolerance for corruption. In Italy, Colombia, and Pakistan legislators and citizens respond similarly to hypothetical scenarios involving trade-offs between, for example, probity and efficiency: both perceive corruption as undesirable but prevalent. These novel descriptive data further reveal that legislators generally have accurate beliefs about public opinion on corruption and understand its relevance to voters. An informational treatment updates legislators’ beliefs about public opinion. The treatment produces downward adjustments among legislators who initially overestimated citizens’ anti-corruption preferences. We also present descriptive data that tolerance of corruption is predicted by politician attributes, most notably motivations for entering politics. Finally, results reconfirm partisan bias by voters in evaluations of corruption. Overall, results suggest that barriers to effective anti-corruption policies are unlikely to lie with lack of information by legislators or by their deliberate commitment to corrupt activities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32825,32825,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Global Hegemony and Exorbitant Privilege,Carolin Pflueger & Pierre Yared,"We present a dynamic two-country model in which military spending, geopolitical risk, and government bond prices are jointly determined. The model is consistent with three empirical facts: hegemons have a funding advantage, this advantage rises with geopolitical tensions, and war losers suffer from higher debt devaluation than victors. Even though higher debt capacity increases the military and financial advantage of the exogenously stronger country, it also gives rise to equilibrium multiplicity and the possibility that the weaker country overwhelms the stronger country with support from financial markets. For intermediate debt capacity, transitional dynamics exhibit geopolitical hysteresis, with dominance determined by initial conditions, unless war is realized and induces a hegemonic transition. For high debt capacity, transitional dynamics exhibit geopolitical fragility, where bond market expectations drive unpredictable transitions in dominance, and hegemonic transitions occur even in the absence of war.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32775,32775,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Beliefs About Political News in the Run-up to an Election,"Charles Angelucci, Michel Gutmann & Andrea Prat","This paper develops a model of news discernment to explore the influence of elections on the formation of partisan-driven parallel information universes. Using survey data from news quizzes administered during and outside the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the model shows that partisan congruence’s impact on news discernment is substantially amplified during election periods. Outside an election, when faced with a true and a fake news story and asked to select the most likely true story, an individual is 4% more likely to choose the true story if it favors their party; in the days prior to the election, this increases to 11%.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32802,32802,24-Aug,NBER,8/12/2024
Local Projections,"Òscar Jordà, Alan M. Taylor","A central question in applied research is to estimate the effect of an exogenous intervention or shock on an outcome. The intervention can affect the outcome and controls on impact and over time. Moreover, there can be subsequent feedback between outcomes, controls and the intervention. Many of these interactions can be untangled using local projections.

"Credit Supply, Prices, and Non-price Mechanisms in the Mortgage Market",John Mondragon,"I use an episode of relatively tight credit supply in the jumbo mortgage market to quantify the importance of price and non-price credit supply mechanisms in explaining changes in borrowing. Following market disruptions in March 2020, borrowers with jumbo loans saw significantly tighter credit supply conditions relative to borrowers with conforming loans. As a result, jumbo borrowers were 50 percent less likely to refinance and when they refinanced they borrowed 4-6 percent less than counterfactual borrowers facing looser credit conditions. The reduction in borrowing may have been caused by both an increase in the price and a change in a non-price mechanism, a decline in the availability of cash-out refinances. Decomposing the total effect into a price and cash-out channel, I find that that the cash-out channel accounts for two to three times as much of the decline as the price effect, and together both explain 70-80 percent of the total decline. This suggests that non-price mechanisms can be least as important as prices in clearing credit markets, a fact which is not adequately explained by current models of credit markets.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/08/credit-supply-prices-and-non-price-mechanisms-in-the-mortgage-market,2024-25,8/12/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,8/13/2024
Beneath the Crypto Currents: The Hidden Effect of Crypto “Whales”,"Alan Chernoff, Julapa Jagtiani","While traditional assets often see a divergence in the success of institutional traders and retail traders, we find an even more pronounced difference regarding the holders of Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by volume. We see a significant difference in how large holders of ETH behave compared with smaller holders of ETH relative to price movements and the volatility of the cryptocurrency. We find that large ETH holders tend to increase their ETH holdings prior to a price increase, while small ETH holders tend to reduce their ETH holdings prior to a price increase. In other words, ETH returns tend to move in the direction that benefits crypto “whales” while reducing returns (or increasing loss) to “minnows.” Additionally, we find that the volatility of ETH returns seems to be driven by small retail investors rather than by the crypto whales.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/banking-and-financial-markets/beneath-the-crypto-currents-the-hidden-effect-of-crypto-whales,24-14,24-Aug,FED-PHILADELPHIA,8/13/2024
Inflation Disagreement Weakens the Power of Monetary Policy,"Zheng Liu, Ding Dong, Pengfei Wang, Min Wei","Households often disagree in their inflation outlooks. We present novel empirical evidence that inflation disagreement weakens the power of forward guidance and conventional monetary policy.  These empirical observations can be rationalized by a model featuring heterogeneous beliefs about the central banks’ inflation target.  An agent who perceives higher future inflation also perceives a lower real interest rate and thus would like to borrow more to finance consumption, subject to borrowing constraints.  Higher inflation disagreement would lead to a larger share of borrowing-constrained agents, resulting in more sluggish responses of aggregate consumption to changes in both current and expected future interest rates.  This mechanism also provides a microeconomic foundation for Euler equation discounting that helps resolve the forward guidance puzzle.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/08/inflation-disagreement-weakens-the-power-of-monetary-policy,2024-27,8/13/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,8/14/2024

Persistent Effects of the Paycheck Protection Program and the PPPLF on Small Business Lending,"Mark Spiegel, Lora Dufresne","Using bank-level U.S. Call Report data, we examine the longer-term effects of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and the PPP Liquidity Facility on small business (SME) lending. Our sample runs through the end of 2023H1, by which time almost all PPP loans were forgiven or repaid. To identify a causal impact of program participation, we instrument based on historical bank relationships with the Small Business Administration and the Federal Reserve discount window prior to the onset of the pandemic. Elevated bank participation in both programs was positively associated with a substantial cumulative increase in small business lending growth. However, we find a negative impact of both programs during the final year of our sample, suggesting that the increase may not prove permanent. Our results are driven by the small and medium-sized banks in our sample, which are not stress-tested and hence not included in Y-14 banking data, illustrating the importance of considering small and medium-sized banks in evaluating the performance of SME lending programs.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/08/persistent-effects-of-the-paycheck-protection-program-and-the-ppplf-on-small-business-lending,2024-26,8/13/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,8/14/2024

"Reallocation, productivity, and monetary policy in an energy crisis","Boris Chafwehé, Andrea Colciago and Romanos Priftis","This paper introduces a New Keynesian multi-sector industry model that integrates firm heterogeneity, entry, and exit dynamics, while considering energy production from both fossil fuels and renewables. We investigate the effects of a sustained increase in fossil fuel prices on sectoral size, labour productivity, and inflation. A hike in the price of fossil resources results in higher energy prices. Due to ex-ante heterogeneity in energy intensity in production, the profitability of sectors is impacted asymmetrically. As production costs rise, less efficient firms leave the market, while new entrants must display higher idiosyncratic productivity. While this process enhances average labour productivity, it also results in a lasting decrease in the entry of new firms. A central bank with a strong anti-inflationary stance can circumvent the energy price increase and mitigate its inflationary effects by curbing rising production costs. This policy entails a higher impact cost in terms of output and lower average productivity, but leads to a faster recovery in business dynamism. Thus, our results suggest that monetary policy faces a trade-off between stabilising aggregate activity and business dynamism.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/reallocation-productivity-and-monetary-policy-in-an-energy-crisis,1091,"Fri, 16 Aug 2024 ",BOE,8/17/2024

We use survey measures of changes in bank lending standards, disaggregated by loan category, to quantify the effect of changes in banks' attitudes toward lending on aggregate output, inflation, and interest rates. Bank lending to businesses is particularly important for macroeconomic outcomes, with peak effects on output of around half a percentage point after four quarters of the initial shock. These effects depend on the stage of the business cycle and the proximity of the short-term interest rate to its effective lower bound. The effects are larger when output is growing below trend and when the interest rate is away from its lower bound. We also find that the response of the economy to lending-standards shocks is asymmetric, with tightening shocks having larger effects on output.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2024/wp_24-07,24-07,24-Aug,FED-RICHMOND,8/17/2024

We build on the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980, which significantly expanded and restructured the decades-old federal crop insurance program and adverse weather shocks – over-exposure of crops to heat and acute weather events – to investigate some insights from our model. Banks increased lending to the agricultural sector in counties with higher insurance coverage after 1980, even when affected by adverse weather shocks. Further, while they increased risky lending, they were sufficiently compensated by insurance such that their overall risk did not increase meaningfully.

Auto Finance in the Electric Vehicle Transition,"Elizabeth Klee, Adair Morse, and Chaehee Shin","Financing cost differentials tilt the calculus for households toward electric vehicles (EVs). Using 85 million observations on U.S. auto loans, we study households’ credit risk by engine type, seek to uncover the sources and ask if credit risk differentials are being priced. We find that EV borrowers default 29% less relative to internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) borrowers with a back-of-the-envelope value of $1,457 in lender savings. To disentangle selection from ex post exposure to differential costs of running an EV, we implement a differential shock exposure by treatment model of Borusyak and Hull (2023). We find that a prolonged higher gasoline price regime could result in ICEV borrowers defaulting up to a 83% increase. Do lenders pass along these savings to borrowers? EV borrowers pay 2.2 percentage point lower interest rate, the equivalent of $2,711 in foregone payments. This lower rate is only for captive (manufacturer-based) lenders, not for bank and nonbank lenders, suggestive of policy and strategic motives by manufacturers, not a passing along of credit risk value. Another $1,457 is probably not being priced to households. Finally, we find that the ABS market knows, at least partially, allowing for less in loan loss reserves buffering the ABS, reflecting $233 in savings for the ABS issuer.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/auto-finance-in-the-electric-vehicle-transition.htm,2024-065,24-Aug,FED-BOARD,8/17/2024

Vertical Integration and Plan Design in Healthcare Markets,"José Ignacio Cuesta, Carlos E. Noton & Benjamin Vatter","We measure the impacts of vertical integration between insurers and hospitals. In the Chilean market, where half of private hospital capacity is vertically integrated, integration increases inpatient care spending by 6 percent and decreases consumer surplus and total welfare. Integrated insurers offer generous coverage at integrated hospitals, limited access to rival hospitals, and lower premiums. Competition for enrollees forces non-integrated insurers to provide additional coverage to high-quality non-integrated hospitals, resulting in plan networks that limit hospital competition. Whereas vertical integration reduces double marginalization, skewed cost-sharing structures—and their effect on hospital competition—more than compensate, leading to an overall negative welfare impact.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32833,32833,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024
Parental Leave: Economic Incentives and Cultural Change,"James Albrecht, Per-Anders Edin, Raquel Fernández, Jiwon Lee, Peter Thoursie & Susan Vroman","The distribution of parental leave uptake and childcare activities continues to conform to traditional gender roles. In 2002, with the goal of increasing gender equality, Sweden added a second “daddy month,” i.e., an additional month of pay-related parental leave reserved exclusively for each parent. This policy increased men’s parental leave uptake and decreased women’s, thereby increasing men’s share. To understand how various factors contributed to these outcomes, we develop and estimate a quantitative model of the household in which preferences towards parental leave respond to peer behavior. We distinguish households by the education of the parents and ask the model to match key features of the parental leave distribution before and after the reform by gender and household type (the parents’ education). We find that changed incentives and, especially, changed social norms played an important role in generating these outcomes whereas changed wage parameters, including the future wage penalty associated with different lengths of parental leave uptake, were minor contributors. We then use our model to evaluate three counterfactual policies designed to increase men’s share of parental leave and conclude that giving each parent a non-transferable endowment of parental leave or only paying for the length of time equally taken by each parent would both dramatically increase men’s share whereas decreasing childcare costs has almost no effect.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32839,32839,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024

We analyze a long-running field experiment of online advertising in which a random 0.5% subset of all users are assigned to a group that does not ever see ever ads. We recruit a representative sample of Facebook users in the ads and no-ads groups and estimate their welfare gains from using Facebook using a series of incentive-compatible choice experiments. We find no significant differences in welfare gains from Facebook. Our estimates are relatively precisely estimated reflecting our large sample size (53,166 participants).  Specifically, the minimum detectable difference in median valuations at standard thresholds is $3.18/month compared to a baseline valuation of $31.95/month for giving up access to Facebook. That is, we can reject the hypothesis that the median disutility from advertising exceeds 10% of the median baseline valuation.

Why Do Europeans Save? Micro-Evidence from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey,Charles Yuji Horioka & Luigi Ventura,"We analyze the saving motives of European households using micro-data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), which is conducted by the European Central Bank. We find that the rank ordering of saving motives differs greatly depending on what criterion is used to rank them. For example, we find that the precautionary motive is the most important saving motive of European households when the proportion of households saving for each motive is used as the criterion to rank them but that the retirement motive is the most important saving motive of European households if the quantitative importance of each motive is taken into account. Moreover, the generosity of social safety nets seems to affect the importance of each saving motive, with saving for the retirement motive being less important in countries with generous public pension benefits and saving for the precautionary motive being less important in countries with generous health systems. These findings suggest that the retirement motive and the precautionary motive are the dominant motives for saving in Europe partly because social safety nets are not fully adequate. Finally, our findings suggest that the selfish life-cycle model is more applicable in Europe than is the altruism model.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32838,32838,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024

In this paper, we look at the long run impacts of an intervention targeted to premature children, known as Kangaroo Mother Care. We do so using data from a randomised control trial performed several decades ago in Bogotá, Colombia, to assess the short run impacts of such an intervention. A large fractions of the participants to that trial were examined over 20 years after the original intervention. We first show that the original intervention had a significant impact on externalizing socio-emotional skills at age 22 and a variety of adult outcomes. We then perform a mediation analysis which involves the estimation of a production function of socioemotional skills and show that the long run impact seems to be explained entirely by an increase on one type of parental investment measured when the participants were 12 months old.

Have CEOs Changed?,"Yann Decressin, Steven N.

After the global financial crisis (GFC), the average interviewed CEO candidate has lower overall ability, is more execution oriented / less interpersonal, less charismatic and less creative/strategic than pre-GFC. Except for overall ability and execution oriented/interpersonal, these differences persist in hired CEOs. Interpersonal or “softer” skills do not increase over time, either for CEO candidates or hired CEOs.

Reserve Asset Competition and the Global Fiscal Cycle,Zhengyang Jiang & Robert J. Richmond,"Governments tend to increase their borrowing at the same time, giving rise to a global fiscal cycle. This global fiscal cycle has a large component that is unexplained by global business cycle variables. We propose a novel explanation for the emergence of the global fiscal cycle: governments' competition over the provision of reserve assets gives rise to strategic complementarity in the issuances, even when the reserve assets are substitutes in partial equilibrium. We show our reserve-asset-competition channel explains economically significant common variation in fiscal variables, beyond the common variation induced by correlated business cycles. In doing so, our model of reserve asset demand and supply also shines light on the sources of variation in the convenience yields and seigniorage revenues earned on government debt.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32841,32841,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024
School Milestones Impact Child Mental Health in Taiwan,"Kuan-Ming Chen, Janet Currie, Hui Ding & Wei-Lun Lo","This study uses administrative health insurance records in Taiwan to examine changes in child mental health treatment around four school milestones including: Primary and middle school entry, high stakes testing for high school, and high stakes testing for college entry.  Leveraging age cutoffs for school entry in Taiwan, we compare August-born children to children born in September of the same year. The former hit all the milestones one year earlier than the latter, enabling us to identify each milestone’s effect. We find that entry into both primary school and middle schools is associated with increases in mental health prescribing, not only for ADHD but also for depression.  Middle school entry is also associated with increases in the prescribing of anti-anxiety and antipsychotic medications.   Perhaps surprisingly, there is no run-up in the use of psychiatric medications prior to high-stakes tests. But the use of psychiatric medications falls sharply following the tests.  These effects are stronger in counties where both parents and children have higher educational aspirations.  Hence, the use of psychiatric drugs increases at junctures when educational stresses increase and falls when these stresses are relieved.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32842,32842,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024
Who Benefits from Retirement Saving Incentives in the U.S.? Evidence on Gaps in Retirement Wealth Accumulation by Race and Parental Income,"Taha Choukhmane, Jorge Colmenares, Cormac O'Dea, Jonathan L. Rothbaum & Lawrence D.W. Schmidt","U.S. employers and the federal government devote over 1.5% of GDP annually toward promoting defined contribution (DC) retirement saving. Using a new employer-employee linked dataset covering millions of Americans, we show that this system of saving incentives benefits White workers and those with richer parents more than their similar-income coworkers who are Black or Hispanic or from lower-income families. Breaking the link between contribution choices and saving subsidies—through revenue-neutral reforms—could close the gaps in DC wealth between White and Black or Hispanic workers and between those with the richest and those with the poorest parents by approximately one-third.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32843,32843,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024
Disemployment Effects of Unemployment Insurance: A Meta-Analysis,Jonathan P. Cohen & Peter Ganong,"We systematically review studies of how unemployment benefits affect unemployment duration. Statistically significant findings are eleven times more likely to be published. Correcting for publication bias halves the average elasticity. Meta-analysis provides a principled way for sufficient statistics methods to aggregate estimates across policy contexts and speak to the optimality of large reforms. Although existing consumption drop-based approaches typically imply an optimal replacement rate near zero, our corrected estimates imply an optimal replacement rate of 28%.

Direct and Indirect Taxes in Pollution Dynamics,"Vladimir Smirnyagin, Aleh Tsyvinski & Xi Wu","Analyzing the universe of federal environmental regulations in the U.S., we construct a measure of regulations—direct taxes on pollution. Analyzing the universe of firms’ investor disclosures, we construct a measure of material environmental concerns—indirect taxes on pollution. These two empirical measures are new to the environmental regulations literature. Thirdly, we document an important new fact that the cross-sectional distribution of pollution changes is lumpy. We build a dynamic heterogeneous firm model with non-convex adjustment costs that fits the cross-sectional pollution evidence. The model explains half of the pollution decline in U.S. manufacturing over the last two decades due to direct and indirect taxes. We show that the dynamics of direct taxes (environmental regulations) and indirect taxes (environmental concerns), non-convex adjustment costs, and idiosyncratic productivity shocks are key determinants of pollution dynamics in U.S. manufacturing.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32852,32852,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024
Reducing Emissions and Air Pollution from the Informal Sector: Evidence from Bangladesh,"Nina R. Brooks, Debashish Biswas, Sameer Maithel, Grant Miller, Aprajit Mahajan, M. Rofi Uddin, Shoeb Ahmed, Moogdho Mahzab, Mahbubur Rahman & Stephen P. Luby et al. (View all)","We present results from a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh that introduced operational practices to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions in 276 “zigzag” brick kilns.  65% of intervention kilns adopted the improved practices. Treatment assignment reduced energy use by 10.3% (p-value<0.001) and decreased CO2 and PM2.5 emissions by 171 metric tons and 0.45 metric tons, respectively, per kiln per year. Valuing the CO2 reductions using a social cost of carbon of $185/MT, we find that the social benefits outweigh costs by a factor of 190 to 1. The intervention, which required no new capital investment, also decreased fuel costs and increased brick quality.

Short-time Employment Aid During the Covid-19 Lockdown Short- and Long-run Effectiveness,"Luca Salerno, Axel H. Börsch-Supan, Diana López-Falcón & Johannes Rausch","The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant economic disruptions, prompting many governments to implement short-time employment aid (STEA) to mitigate job losses and income reductions. This study examines the effectiveness of STEA in the short and long term in Europe among workers aged 50 and older, a part of the population that was especially threatened by the disease. Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we analyze the impact of STEA on employment status, working hours, and income during and after the pandemic.
STEA was widespread in Europe. Our findings indicate that the use of STEA was in general reasonably targeted and may have helped its recipients to avoid even worse economic losses during the pandemic, especially after a learning process from 2020 to 2021. However, STEA may have led to increased employment instability in the longer run. Specifically, recipients of STEA were more likely to experience unemployment or furloughs post-pandemic. These results highlight the importance of designing STEA policies that not only provide immediate economic relief but also support sustainable employment and economic resilience.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32760,32760,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024

This setting allows us to collect rich data on the adoption of this new technology at the project-level (i.e., movie) as well as on the career of the main decision maker (i.e., director). We find that early career directors played a leading role in the adoption of digital technology and that this effect appears to be explained by career concerns, rather than alternative motives we consider and analyze.

"NAR Settlement, House Prices, and Consumer Welfare","Greg Buchak, Gregor Matvos, Tomasz Piskorski & Amit Seru","Motivated by the recent National Association of Realtors (NAR) settlement, this note examines the effects of reduced real estate agent commissions on home prices, housing turnover, and consumer welfare. Using a calibrated dynamic structural search model of the housing market, we explore how lowering agent commissions might influence market equilibrium. Our analysis highlights the importance of accounting for the dynamic nature of the housing market, consumer heterogeneity, and general equilibrium effects when assessing these outcomes. Contrary to the claims of some media commentators and consumer advocates, our findings suggest that reducing agent fees generally leads to higher house prices. This occurs because lower future transaction costs increase the value of housing as a durable asset. While reduced agent fees typically enhance consumer welfare by lowering the cost of homeownership, we find that most of these benefits are likely to accrue to current homeowners rather than prospective buyers. Furthermore, financially constrained households may see diminished benefits due to the expected rise in home prices. Our analysis also offers insights into the redistributive effects of technological innovations in the housing market aimed at reducing transaction costs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32855,32855,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024

Kahou, Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Sebastian Gomez-Cardona, Jesse Perla & Jan Rosa","In the long run, we are all dead. Nonetheless, when studying the short-run dynamics of economic models, it is crucial to consider boundary conditions that govern long-run, forward-looking behavior, such as transversality conditions. We demonstrate that machine learning (ML) can automatically satisfy these conditions due to its inherent inductive bias toward finding flat solutions to functional equations. This characteristic enables ML algorithms to solve for transition dynamics, ensuring that long-run boundary conditions are approximately met. ML can even select the correct equilibria in cases of steady-state multiplicity. Additionally, the inductive bias provides a foundation for modeling forward-looking behavioral agents with self-consistent expectations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32850,32850,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024
Firm Adaptation to Climate Change,Arti Grover & Matthew E.

Climate change increases the uncertainty that every firm must address as it decides where and how to produce and who to trade with. We study how expectations, market structure and firm heterogeneity determine investment in self-protection. A firm’s resilience also depends on government policies, market insurance access and infrastructure investments. We explore the strategic interactions between firms and governments that together determine firm risk exposure.

We provide closed-form expressions mapping reciprocal tariff cuts to labor market dislocation. We demonstrate that a country’s own tariff liberalization is a sufficient statistic for the labor-market adjustments it can expect from tariff negotiations that satisfy reciprocity. Applying our theoretical results to China’s 2001 WTO accession, we find that China’s tariff reductions exceeded reciprocity norms, increasing real incomes but amplifying the manufacturing employment dislocation – the China Shock – in the United States and globally.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32835,32835,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024
A Business Case for Human Rights at Work? Experimental Evidence on Labor Trafficking and Child Labor at Brick Kilns in Bangladesh,"Grant Miller, Debashish Biswas, Aprajit Mahajan, Kimberly Singer Babiarz, Nina R.

(View all)","Globally, coercive labor (i.e., forced, bonded, and/or trafficked labor) and child labor are disproportionately prevalent in environments with weak regulatory enforcement and state capacity. Effective strategies for addressing them may therefore need to align with the private incentives of business owners, not relying on government action alone. Recognizing this, we test a ‘business case’ for improving work conditions and promoting human rights using a randomized controlled trial across nearly 300 brick kilns in Bangladesh. Among study kilns, rates of coercive and child labor are high: about 50% of sampled workers are trafficked, and about 70% of kilns use child labor. Our experiment introduced a production method that increased kiln productivity and revenue, and we test if these productivity gains in turn increase worker “compensation” (including better work conditions). Because adoption of the method requires important changes in worker routines, we also test if providing information to kiln owners about positively incentivizing workers to enhance adoption (and hence business revenue) can lead to better work conditions. We find no evidence that productivity gains alone reduced labor trafficking or child labor, but adding the information intervention reduced child labor by 25-30% without reducing revenue or increasing costs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32829,32829,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024
Political Partisanship and Remote Work: Evidence from U.S. States,Benjamin W. Cowan & Kairon Shayne D. Garcia,"We examine how politics and policy have affected remote-work rates in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the Current Population Survey, American Community Survey, and the American Time Use Survey, which have several different measures of remote work, we examine how trends in remote work vary by state-level characteristics. We show that state-level measures of the length and stringency of COVID protection policies are not correlated with changes in remote work from before to after the pandemic once a measure of political partisanship (Democratic vote share in the 2020 presidential election) is included in the model. An increase in 2020 Democratic vote share of one standard deviation (about 9 percentage points) is related to an increase in the likelihood of remote work by 1-2 percentage points and the share of remote work by about 3-5 percent. These effects represent roughly 15-25% of pre-COVID means. These results are robust to the inclusion of not only a rich set of individual controls (e.g., occupational telework potential) but also several different state-level controls, including COVID policy indices, cases and deaths, vaccination rates, and economic performance indicators. We conclude that relative increases in remote work across states that are associated with a higher 2020 Democratic vote share cannot be easily explained by differences in COVID-era policies or outcomes or differences in the nature of jobs across states.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32834,32834,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024

Credit When You Need It,"Benjamin L. Collier, Daniel A. Hartley, Benjamin J. Keys & Jing Xian Ng","We estimate the causal effect of emergency credit on households' finances after a negative shock. To do so, we link application data from the U.S. Federal Disaster Loan program, which provides loans to households that have uninsured damages from a federally-declared natural disaster, to a panel of credit records before and after the shock. We exploit a discontinuity in the loan approval rules that led applicants with debt-to-income ratios below 40% to be differentially likely to be approved. Using an instrumented difference-in-differences research design, we find that credit provision at the time of a shock significantly reduces severe financial distress, decreasing the likelihood of filing for bankruptcy by 61% in the three years following the disaster. We explore mechanisms using additional quasi-experimental variation in interest rates, finding support for a liquidity-based explanation. Credit provision in a time of crisis has real consumption effects in the form of additional car purchases even 3 years after loan receipt. Our findings suggest that well-timed liquidity provided to households in acute need can have substantial and persistent positive effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32845,32845,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024
Modeling Uncertainty in Climate Policy: An Application to the US IRA,James B. Bushnell & Aaron Smith,"In recent years the analysis of US climate policy on the electricity sector has predominantly deployed electricity planning or capacity expansion models that use deterministic or equilibrium optimization methods.  While uncertainty in key input assumptions is considered, it is usually restricted to scenario analysis.   In this study we combine time-series econometric forecasting methods with an equilibrium electricity system-expansion model.  The goal is to produce statistically rigorous distributions of outcomes, rather than rely upon individually selected scenarios.
We apply these techniques to the case of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the context of the western US electricity grid.  The most significant power sector financial incentives are tax credits applied to eligible zero-carbon and storage resources.  Our results indicate that the impact of the IRA, in terms of additional investment in low-carbon resources, depends heavily on the realization of key exogenous variables.  However, the net effect of the IRA is to sharply narrow the range of future carbon emissions, largely by eliminating states of the world where investment in natural gas resources would otherwise be optimal.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32830,32830,24-Aug,NBER,8/19/2024

Consumer and Firm Perceptions of the Aggregate Labor Market Conditions,"Marianna Kudlyak, Brandon Miskanic","In the pre-pandemic period, measures of consumer labor market perceptions correlated well with the aggregate unemployment rate. However, for more than a year during the pandemic, consumers perceived labor markets as much tighter than the high aggregate unemployment rate implied. In contrast, there is no such a departure from the historic relation if we use the jobless unemployment rate-unemployment for reasons other than temporary layoffs-as a measure of labor market tightness. Using a measure of the firm labor market perceptions from the National Federation of Independent Business, we find that during the post-pandemic period, firms perceived labor market as being tighter than what consumers perceived, given the historic relation between the two series. Furthermore, despite the vacancy-unemployment ratio was at its historic high levels during the post-pandemic period, our measure of firm perceptions signaled that the labor market was even tighter. In June-July 2024, the relations between consumer and firm perceptions and between various measures of labor market tightness are back to its pre-pandemic patterns.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/08/consumer-and-firm-perceptions-of-the-aggregate-labor-market-conditions,2024-28,8/19/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,8/20/2024
How Widespread is FDI Fragmentation?,Joanne Tan,"This paper examines the extent to which FDI has fragmented across countries, the ways it has done so, using a modified gravity approach. The paper finds that FDI fragmentation is, for now, not a widespread phenomenon. Instead, fragmentation is circumscribed in two ways. First, the paper finds that geo-economic fragmentation has occurred only for certain industries that likely have strategic value, including computer manufacturing, information and communications, transport, as well as professional, scientific and technical services. Secondly, fragmentation appears to be more pronounced for outward FDI from the US, notably in a shift of US FDI from China to advanced Europe and the rest of Asia. This shift appears to be driven by both the intensive and extensive margin. Fragmentation is also more pronounced for immediate rather than ultimate FDI, with evidence of ultimate parent companies aligning the geopolitical mix of their intermediaries more closely to that of their final FDI host destinations. Overall, the results suggest that fragmentation, where found, may be a response to targeted policies that have placed curbs on certain types of FDI on national security grounds, rather than an indiscriminate breakup of investment links between non-ally countries.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/16/How-Widespread-is-FDI-Fragmentation-551132,2024-179,"Fri, 16 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/20/2024

Industrial Policies for Innovation: A Cost-Benefit Framework,Daniel Garcia-Macia ; Alexandre Sollaci,"When and how should governments use industrial policy to direct innovation to specific sectors? This paper develops a framework to analyze the costs and benefits of industrial policies for innovation. The framework is based on a model of endogenous innovation with a sectoral network of knowledge spillovers (Liu and Ma 2023), extended to capture implementation frictions and alternative policy goals. Simulations show that implementing sector-specific fiscal support is only preferable to sector-neutral support under restrictive conditions—when externalities are well measured (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions), domestic knowledge spillovers of targeted sectors are high (typically in larger economies), and administrative capacity is strong (including to avoid misallocation to politically connected sectors). If any of these conditions are not fully met, welfare impacts of industrial policy quickly become negative. The optimal allocation of support entails greater subsidies to greener sectors, but other factors such as cross-sector knowledge spillovers matter. For a sample of technologically advanced economies, existing industrial policies seem to be directing innovation to broadly the right sectors, but to an excessive degree in most economies, including China and the United States.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/15/Industrial-Policies-for-Innovation-A-Cost-Benefit-Framework-553520,2024-176,"Fri, 16 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/20/2024
Programmability in Payment and Settlement,Xavier Lavayssière ; Nicolas Zhang,"Programmability in payment and settlement has yet to realize its potential to support policy goals such as efficiency, safety, and innovation. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for understanding and evaluating programmability. It explores two key dimensions: external programmatic access, which is the ability for external participants to access the system data and functions with code, and internal programmatic capabilities, the extent to which internal execution of programs is supported and guaranteed. By developing strategies based on these dimensions, financial institutions, regulators, and related actors can better improve resilience, reduce costs and interoperability, all while managing associated risks. The resulting hybrid systems are coordinated efforts balancing the advantages of permissionless blockchains, such as composability, with regulatory requirements and a wider range of technologies.

The Heterogeneous Impact of Referrals on Labor Market Outcomes,"Benjamin Lester, David A. Rivers, Giorgio Topa","A previous version of this working paper was originally published in October 2021. We study the impact of referrals on labor market outcomes. First, we document a new set of facts exploiting data that allow us to distinguish directly between different types of referrals — those from family and friends and those from business contacts — and different types of jobs, as measured by the skill requirements of the occupation. We then develop a structural framework to interpret these facts and quantify the effects of social and business networks on employment, earnings, output, and inequality. Referrals from family and friends generate good jobs for all workers but are relied upon by those who struggle to generate offers through other channels. Referrals from business contacts are used predominantly by more productive workers who receive offers through other channels relatively frequently. An important implication is that referrals from business contacts exacerbate earnings inequality, while referrals from family and friends actually reduce inequality.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/macroeconomics/the-heterogeneous-impact-of-referrals-on-labor-market-outcomes,21-34,Revised: August 2024,FED-PHILADELPHIA,8/22/2024
Consumption Dynamics and Welfare Under Non-Gaussian Earnings Risk,"Fatih Guvenen, Rocio Madera, and Serdar Ozkan","CORRECT ORDER OF AUTHORS: Fatih Guvenen, Serdar Ozkan, and Rocio Madera. The order of coauthors has been assigned randomly using AEA’s Author Randomization Tool.

Recent empirical studies document that the distribution of earnings changes displays substantial deviations from lognormality: in particular, earnings changes are negatively skewed with extremely high kurtosis (long and thick tails), and these non-Gaussian features vary substantially both over the life cycle and with the earnings level of individuals. Furthermore, earnings changes display nonlinear (asymmetric) mean reversion. In this paper, we embed a very rich “benchmark earnings process” that captures these non-Gaussian and nonlinear features into a lifecycle consumption-saving model and study its implications for consumption dynamics, consumption insurance, and welfare. We show four main results. First, the benchmark process essentially matches the empirical lifetime earnings inequality—a first-order proxy for consumption inequality—whereas the canonical Gaussian (persistent-plus-transitory) process understates it by a factor of five to ten. Second, the welfare cost of idiosyncratic risk implied by the benchmark process is between two-to-four times higher than the canonical Gaussian one. Third, the standard method in the literature for measuring the pass-through of income shocks to consumption—can significantly overstate the degree of consumption smoothing possible under non-Gaussian shocks. Fourth, the marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income (e.g., from a stimulus check) is higher under non-Gaussian earnings risk.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-007,2024-007B,24-Apr,FED-STLOUIS,8/22/2024

We find significant heterogeneity in both RTS and TFP across firms. Larger firms operate technologies with higher RTS, both across and within industries. Higher RTS for large firms are entirely driven by higher intermediate input elasticities. Descriptively, these align with higher intermediate input revenue shares. We then incorporate RTS heterogeneity into an otherwise standard incomplete markets model with endogenous entrepreneurship that matches the observed heterogeneity in TFP and RTS. In this model, we find that the efficiency losses of financial frictions are more than twice as large relative to the conventional calibration that loads all heterogeneity on TFP and imposes a common RTS parameter.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-019,2024-019A,24-Aug,FED-STLOUIS,8/22/2024
Corporate Debt Maturity Matters for Monetary Policy,"Joachim Jungherr, Matthias Meier, Timo Reinelt, Immo Schott","We provide novel empirical evidence that firms’ investment is more responsive to monetary policy when a higher fraction of their debt matures. In a heterogeneous firm New Keynesian model with financial frictions and endogenous debt maturity, two channels explain this finding: (1.) Firms with more maturing debt have larger roll-over needs and are therefore more exposed to fluctuations in the real interest rate (roll-over risk). (2.) These firms also have higher default risk and therefore react more strongly to changes in the real burden of outstanding nominal debt (debt overhang). Unconventional monetary policy, which operates through long-term interest rates, has larger effects on debt maturity but smaller effects on output and inflation than conventional monetary policy.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/08/corporate-debt-maturity-matters-for-monetary-policy,2024-30,8/22/2024,FED-SANFRANCISCO,8/23/2024

Inframarginal Borrowers and the Mortgage Payment Channel of Monetary Policy,Daniel Ringo,"Despite the widespread use of fixed-rate mortgages in the United States, I show that monetary policy is effectively passed through to aggregate outstanding mortgage debt service. Using credit bureau, lender, and servicer data on mortgage payments and originations and exogenous monetary policy shocks, I estimate a mortgage rate semi-elasticity of payments over 10. Inframarginal borrowers—households whose choice to buy a home or refinance does not depend on the particular monetary policy decision under consideration—are the most important conduit, explaining over half of the pass-through. Consistently large flows of inframarginal borrowing relative to the stock of outstanding debt account for the strength of this channel. Households with adjustable-rate mortgages and marginal refinancers, the focus of much of the literature on monetary policy's effect on mortgage borrowers, each explain about 20 percent of the pass-through. I show the mortgage payment channel induces a lag in the operation of policy, as the cumulative effects on debt service build over time in response to persistent shocks to longer-term rates. Estimated magnitudes suggest that mortgage payments are a primary channel by which monetary policy affects consumption.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/inframarginal-borrowers-and-the-mortgage-payment-channel-of-monetary-policy.htm,2024-069,24-Aug,FED-BOARD,8/24/2024
The COVID-19 Pandemic and Family Economic Well-being: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,"Sarena Goodman, Gina Li, Kevin Moore, and Alice Henriques Volz","The COVID-19 pandemic caused severe disruptions to the U.S. labor market and economic activity. We establish connections between family experiences of the pandemic, their income under normal conditions, and their later economic well-being using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances. By their interview, one-third of families experienced net employment declines, one-third had teleworked, and one-fifth had significant COVID-19-related health events. These experiences strongly reflected families’ positions in the income distribution, with lower-income families bearing the brunt.

Advancing Labor Market Reforms in Korea,Stella Tam ; Xin Cindy Xu,"This paper examines structural challenges facing the Korean labor market and analyzes the macroeconomic effects of potential labor market reforms. Our cross-country empirical analysis finds that easing of employment protection legislation tends to have positive macroeconmic effects during periods of strong growth but could turn contractionary in periods of slack. By contrast, increased spending on active labor market policies and reductions to the labor tax wedge tend to be more effective in periods of slack. Our analysis thus highlights the importance of considering economic and policy conditions when designing labor market reforms. Under the current disinflationary policy stance, the government’s focus on the working hour reform seems appriorate. With growth recovering, deregulation to reduce employment protection for regular workers can also be considered, combined with targeted support to vulnerable groups.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/23/Advancing-Labor-Market-Reforms-in-Korea-553978,2024-183,"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/24/2024

It contributes to the existing literature by introducing a formal test for the stability of the mean of exogenous variables in the estimation set up, and by developing a self-contained statistical package to streamline the whole estimation process. The empirical strategy is designed to be parsimonious, aiming to avoid the pitfalls associated with overly complex models while achieving comparable results.

Investing in Climate Adaptation under Trade and Financing Constraints: Balanced Strategies for Food Security,Chen Chen ; Koralai Kirabaeva,"Financially constrained governments, particularly in emerging and developing economies, tend to face a fiscal trade-off between adapting to climate change impacts and pursuing broader development goals. This trade-off is especially relevant in the agriculture sector, where investing in adaptation is critical to ensure food security amidst climate change. International trade can help alleviate this challenge and reduce adaptation investment needs by offsetting agricultural production shortages. However, in the presence of trade fragmentation, the adaptive role of trade diminishes, exacerbating food insecurity and increasing investment needs for adaptation. In this paper, we present a model to guide policymakers in deciding on the cost-efficient balance between investing in adaptation in the agricultural sector versus in broader development under financing and trade constraints. We apply the model to Ghana, Egypt, and Brazil, to examine the adaptation-development trade-off and highlight factors that would potentially lower adaptation investment needs. These factors include trade openness, higher agricultural productivity and efficiency of adaptation spending, and reduced labor market distortions. The key takeaways from the model applications suggest that (i) promoting trade openness and accessing concessional finance for adaptation help tackle climate challenges and ensure food security in lower-income countries; and (ii) domestic structural reforms are necessary to facilitate adaptation investments and reduce investment needs, by improving labor market flexibility, adaptation efficiency, and agriculture productivity.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/23/Investing-in-Climate-Adaptation-under-Trade-and-Financing-Constraints-Balanced-Strategies-553983,2024-184,"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/24/2024

Going forward, the projected public debt trajectories are broadly flat overall in advanced Europe but have a rising profile in emerging Europe. Government financing needs are still elevated, and the unwinding of quantitative easing by major central banks adds to financing pressures. Moreover, there are important medium- to long-term spending pressures from defense, climate transition, and aging, which are not fully reflected in the projected baseline trajectories. Against this backdrop, the risk that debts will not stabilize in the medium term has increased. Debt stabilization will hinge critically on achieving ambitious fiscal consolidation and sustained growth. Facing these elevated risks, policymakers need to implement carefully-calibrated fiscal adjustments that ensure debt sustainability while supporting growth. They could target debt stabilization over a longer, 10-year, horizon—while adhering to credible fiscal rules such as the reformed EU Economic Governance Framework—but with a high probability to reassure markets that debts will indeed be tamed.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/23/Taming-Public-Debt-in-Europe-Outlook-Challenges-and-Policy-Response-553526,2024-181,"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/24/2024
"Tasks At Work: Comparative Advantage, Technology and Labor Demand","Daron Acemoglu, Fredric Kong & Pascual Restrepo","This chapter reviews recent advances in the task model and shows how this framework can be put to work to understand the major labor market trends of the last several decades. Production in each industry necessitates the completion of a range of tasks, which can be allocated to workers of different skill types or to capital. Factors of production have well-defined comparative advantage across tasks, which governs the pattern of substitution between skill groups. Technological change can: (1) augment a specific labor type—e.g., increase the productivity of labor in tasks it is already performing; (2) augment capital; (3) automate work by enabling capital to perform tasks previously allocated to labor; (4) create new tasks. The task model clarifies that these different types of technological changes have distinct effects on labor demand, factor shares and productivity, and their full impact depends on the pattern of substitution between different factors which arises endogenously in the task framework. We explore the implications of the task framework using reduced-form evidence, which highlights the central role of automation and new tasks in recent labor market trends. We also explain how general equilibrium effects ignored in these reduced-form approaches can be estimated structurally.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32872,32872,24-Aug,NBER,8/26/2024
Crypto Tax Evasion,"Tom G.

The context of the study is Norway. This context allows us to address key measurement challenges by combining de-anonymized crypto trading data with individual tax returns, survey data, and information from tax enforcement interventions. We find that crypto tax noncompliance is pervasive, even among investors trading on exchanges that share identifiable trading data with tax authorities.

The lower support concentrates in recent years, when politicians became more vocal about firms’ social responsibility activities, and among larger institutions and firms, which tend to attract more attention from politicians. Investor support also shifts within states following changes in their leadership. Support for such proposals is 10 percentage points lower in the same state when it is led by Republicans instead of Democrats.

International Spillovers of U.S. Fiscal Challenges,"Joshua Aizenman, William Eldén, Yothin Jinjarak, Gazi Salah Uddin & Frida Widholm","Expansionary fiscal policies have increased significantly following the subprime crisis in 2007 and the COVID-19 crisis, leading to fiscal dominance concerns, where a growing share of monetary authorities may be forced to deviate from policy targets to accommodate fiscal policies. Meanwhile, peripheral economies are constantly influenced by monetary and fiscal conditions in center economies, with the United States (U.S.) as the predominant force. In light of these developments, we examine the potential international spillovers from U.S. inflationary spells and growing fiscal concerns to the policy interest rates in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) and Developed Economies (DEs). We introduce a new index of fiscal dominance concerns using Principal Components Analysis, and extend the concept to an international perspective, as opposed to previous literature examining fiscal dominance in a domestic environment. The results are confirmed by robustness analysis and show that greater U.S. fiscal challenges affect negatively the policy rates in both EMEs and DEs, with a greater impact observed in EMEs. Moreover, a low degree of financial repression is associated with more significant spillover effects from greater U.S. fiscal challenges.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32868,32868,24-Aug,NBER,8/26/2024

We find that this income uncertainty leads lenders to ration credit to temporary workers, precisely at the stage of life when permanent workers rely on mortgages to invest in housing and loans to smooth consumption and purchase durable goods. Labor laws that improve job security for permanent workers create a dual credit market alongside the dual labor market, making it harder for young adults to establish financial independence and new families.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32858,32858,24-Aug,NBER,8/26/2024

Creditor-on-Creditor Violence and Secured Debt Dynamics,"Samuel Antill, Neng Wang & Zhaoli Jiang","Secured lenders have recently demanded a new condition in distressed debt restructurings: competing secured lenders must lose priority. We model the implications of this “creditor-on-creditor violence” trend. In our dynamic model, secured lenders enjoy higher priority in default. However, secured lenders take value-destroying actions to boost their own recovery: they sell assets inefficiently early. We show that this creates an ex-ante tradeoff between secured and unsecured debt that matches recent empirical evidence. Introducing the recent creditor-conflict trend in this model endogenously increases secured credit spreads. Importantly, it also increases ex-ante total surplus: restructurings endogenously introduce efficient state-contingent debt reduction.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32823,32823,24-Aug,NBER,8/26/2024
Taxation and Household Decisions: an Intertemporal Analysis,"Mary Ann Bronson, Daniel Haanwinckel & Maurizio Mazzocco","How do different income taxation systems affect household decisions and welfare? We answer this question by first documenting the strong labor supply disincentives for secondary earners of the U.S. tax system and by using variations from the Bush Tax Cuts to assess their effects on intra-household specialization. We then develop a lifecycle model incorporating labor supply, marriage and divorce decisions with limited commitment, household production, human capital accumulation, and assortative mating. After estimating and validating the model with various datasets, we evaluate four tax systems: a U.S.-like income-splitting system, an individual taxation system, a flexible general joint system, and an income-splitting system with secondary-earner deductions. We find that the individual taxation system provides higher welfare than income splitting but increases inequality. The general joint system offers the highest welfare but is complex to implement. The income-splitting system with a secondary-earner deduction improves welfare and reduces inequality while maintaining simplicity.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32861,32861,24-Aug,NBER,8/26/2024

The Potential Long-Run Implications of a Permanently-Expanded Child Tax Credit,Elizabeth Ananat & Irwin Garfinkel,"For many of those who worked to include an expanded Child Tax Credit in the 2021 American Rescue Plan, an important motivation was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a permanent U.S. child allowance similar to those provided in other rich countries. Because this expansion was short-lived, however, evaluations of its effects cannot provide complete evidence on the long-run effects of a permanently expanded CTC. We leverage theoretical predictions from standard economic models, behavioral science, and child development frameworks, along with empirical evidence from literature evaluating previous long-term cash and quasi-cash transfers to families with children, to predict the likely long-run impacts of a permanent child allowance. We find that it would lead to increased future earnings and tax payments, improved health and longevity, and reduced health care, crime, and child protection costs; using conventional valuations, benefits to society outweigh costs nearly 10 to 1, with most benefits due to credit refundability.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32870,32870,24-Aug,NBER,8/26/2024
Busing to Opportunity? The Impacts of the METCO Voluntary School Desegregation Program on Urban Students of Color,Elizabeth Setren,"School assignment policies are a key lever to increase access to high performing schools and to promote racial and socioeconomic integration. For over 50 years, the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO) has bussed students of color from Boston, Massachusetts to relatively wealthier and predominantly White suburbs. Using a combination of digitized historical records and administrative data, I analyze the short and long run effects of attending a high-performing suburban school for applicants to the METCO program. I compare those with and without offers to enroll in suburban schools. I use a two-stage least squares approach that utilizes the waitlist assignment priorities and controls for a rich set of characteristics from birth records and application data. Attending a suburban school boosts 10th grade Math and English test scores by 0.13 and 0.21 standard deviations respectively. The program reduces dropout rates by 75 percent and increases on-time high school graduation by 13 percentage points. The suburban schools increase four-year college aspirations by 17 percentage points and enrollment by 21 percentage points. Participation results in a 12 percentage point increase in four-year college graduation rates. Enrollment increases average earnings at age 35 by $16,250. Evidence of tracking to lower performing classes in the suburban schools suggests these effects could be larger with access to more advanced coursework. Effects are strongest for students whose parents did not graduate college.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32864,32864,24-Aug,NBER,8/26/2024
"Race, Ethnicity, and Measurement Error","Bruce D. Meyer, Nikolas Mittag & Derek Wu","Large literatures have analyzed racial and ethnic disparities in economic outcomes and access to the safety net. For such analyses that rely on survey data, it is crucial that survey accuracy does not vary by race and ethnicity. Otherwise, the observed disparities may be confounded by differences in survey error. In this paper, we review existing studies that use linked data to assess the reporting of key programs (including SNAP, Social Security, Unemployment Insurance, TANF, Medicaid, Medicare, and private pensions) in major Census Bureau surveys, aiming to extract the evidence on differences in survey accuracy by race and ethnicity. Our key finding is a strong and robust, but previously largely unnoticed, pattern of greater measurement error for Black and Hispanic individuals and households relative to whites. As the dominant error is under-reporting for a wide variety of programs, samples, and surveys, the implication is that the safety net better supports minority groups than the survey data suggest, through higher program receipt and greater poverty reduction. These biases in survey estimates are large in many cases examined in the literature. We conclude that racial and ethnic minorities are inadequately served by our large household surveys and that researchers should cautiously interpret survey-based estimates of racial and ethnic differences in program receipt and post-benefit income. We briefly discuss paths forward.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32860,32860,24-Aug,NBER,8/26/2024

Can Technical Education in High School Smooth Postsecondary Transitions for Students with Disabilities?,"Eric Brunner, Shaun Dougherty & Stephen Ross","Participation in Career Technical Education (CTE) programs has been proposed as a valuable strategy for supporting transition to independence among students with disabilities. We exploit a discontinuity created by admissions thresholds from a statewide system of CTE high schools. Our findings suggest attending CTE high schools has large positive effects on completing high school on time, employment, and earnings, including for individuals 22 years or older. Attending CTE schools also results in more time spent with non-disabled peers and higher 10th grade test scores. These results appear concentrated among male students, but the sample of female students is too small to support strong conclusions about outcomes. Notably, these estimates are for a system of CTE high schools operating at scale and serving students across a wide spectrum of disabilities, and the estimated effects appear broad based over disability type, time spent with non-disabled peers in 8th grade and previous academic performance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32867,32867,24-Aug,NBER,8/26/2024

Looking up to four years post-assistance, we find evidence, especially for the lowest earners, of earnings and employment gains, and overall we find no evidence that assistance lowers earnings or employment.

Trade Implications of China's Subsidies,Lorenzo Rotunno ; Michele Ruta,"Available data show a marked increase in subsidy utilization in China and in other major economies between 2009 and 2022. In this paper, we investigate the effects that China's subsidies have on international trade flows at the product level over this period. The results indicate that the subsidies promoted Chinese exports and limited imports. These effects have been magnified by supply-chain linkages: subsidies given to upstream industries expand significantly the exports of downstream industries. Additional analysis of the price and quantity effects at the product level shows that China's subsidies lowered export prices and boosted export quantities in certain sectors such as metal products, furniture and autos, but not in others such as electrical machinery where the evidence is more consistent with quality upgrading.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/15/Trade-Implications-of-China-s-Subsidies-552506,2024-180,"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/27/2024

Restricting teen mobility significantly increases short-run schoolgoing and long-run educational attainment while reducing teen employment.

"Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Nearby Branch Closures and Small Business Growth","Ben Ranish, Andrea Stella, and Jeffery Zhang","Since 2010, the total number of commercial bank branches in the United States has fallen by about 20%. Do branch closures meaningfully affect economic activity? We investigate the impact of branch closures on small businesses, whose credit access may be facilitated through local relationships with bankers.

Determinants of Recent CRE Distress: Implications for the Banking Sector,David Glancy and Robert Kurtzman,"Rising interest rates and structural shifts in the demand for space have strained CRE markets and prompted concern about contagion to the largest CRE debt holder: banks. We use confidential loan-level data on bank CRE portfolios to examine banks’ exposure to at-risk CRE loans. We investigate (1) what loan characteristics are associated with delinquency and (2) to what extent the portfolio composition of major CRE lenders determines their exposure to losses. Higher LTVs, larger property sizes, and greater local remote work tendencies are all associated with increased delinquency risk, particularly for office loans. We use several machine learning algorithms to demonstrate that variation in exposure to these risk factors can account for most of the performance disparity across different types of CRE lenders. The headline result is that small banks’ comparatively modest delinquency rates mostly reflect observable portfolio characteristics—predominantly their low holdings of large-sized office loans—rather than unobserved factors like extension or modification tendencies.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/determinants-of-recent-cre-distress-implications-for-the-banking-sector.htm,2024-072,24-Aug,FED-BOARD,8/31/2024
"Natural Disasters, Local Bank Market Share, and Economic Recovery","Justin Gallagher, Daniel Hartley","U.S. interstate bank deregulation during the 1980s and 1990s led to larger, nationally diversified banks, and a decline in the number of local community banks. Economic theory suggests that community banks may have a greater incentive, but a lower capacity, to lend to a region following a destructive event such as a natural disaster. We test whether there are differences in post-disaster credit allocation and regional redevelopment based on the concentration of local banking at the time of an economic shock. We find causal evidence of less credit allocated and somewhat weaker redevelopment in regions with more local banking.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-17,2024-17,24-Aug,FED-CHICAGO,8/31/2024
"Shock transmission, global supply chains, and development: assessing responses to trade shocks","Akanksha Burman, Peter Egger, Rebecca Freeman, Jean-Christophe Maur, Nadia Rocha and Angelos Theodorakopoulos","We analyse the impact of policy-driven (eg tariffs) and non‑policy-driven (eg conflicts, natural disasters) trade shocks on intermediate versus final goods components of gross production for low, middle, and high-income country groups. Further, we examine the role of direct versus indirect, and foreign versus domestic, channels in transmitting these shocks. Results indicate that tariffs and conflicts impact the composition of gross production by changing its intermediate input component, and these changes are driven predominantly by indirect and foreign channels. Trade protectionism in high‑income countries dampens low‑income countries’ global supply chain (GSC) network participation, but not that of middle‑income countries. Further, it increases their domestic input contribution to output, at the expense of developing nations. On the other hand, trade liberalisation in low and low‑middle‑income countries increases their level of GSC involvement, with the adjustment taking place in high‑income countries through an increase in their use of foreign intermediates.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/shock-transmission-global-supply-chains,1092,"Fri, 30 Aug 2024 ",BOE,8/31/2024

Currencies in Turbulence: Exploring the Impact of Natural Disasters on Exchange Rates,Anh Thi Ngoc Nguyen ; Ha Nguyen,"This paper investigates the impact of natural disasters on exchange rate movements in different country groups with different exchange rate regimes. Using a panel local projection model with a high-frequency monthly dataset of 177 countries during 1970M1-2019M12, we find that exchange rate movements are more sensitive to natural disasters in emerging markets and developing countries (EMDEs) than in advanced economies (AEs). Furthermore, exchange rate reactions to natural shocks depend on exchange rate regimes adopted by EMDEs. On average, both nominal and real exchange rates could depreciate up to 6 percents two years after the disasters in non-pegged regimes. Our findings suggest that EMDEs with flexible exchange rate regimes would observe a faster recovery through nominal and real depreciations, although they should be mindful about policy implications that may arise from large exchange rate fluctuations caused by natural disaster shocks.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/30/Currencies-in-Turbulence-Exploring-the-Impact-of-Natural-Disasters-on-Exchange-Rates-553991,2024-186,"Fri, 30 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/31/2024

Overview of the New Calibrated DSGE Model of the Economy of North Macedonia,Tibor Hlédik ; Joana Madjoska ; Mite Miteski ; Jan Vlcek,"This paper presents a calibrated DSGE model of the economy of North Macedonia that was developed at the National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia (NBRNM) within a technical assistance project delivered jointly by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Czech National Bank (CNB). The model structure reflects the specific characteristics of the economy of North Macedonia. Namely, it is a small open economy DSGE model featuring a fixed exchange rate regime functioning in an economy experiencing structural changes over time. The paper provides a detailed overview of the theoretical structure of the model, including optimization problems of economic agents and first-order optimality conditions. A particular emphasis is put on model calibration, as well as on model evaluation, including the analysis of impulse responses, shock decompositions and historical in-sample simulation. Compared to other empirical papers focusing on DSGE models, our approach explicitly includes additional trends and wedges needed to capture non-stationary great ratios as well as the Balassa-Samuelson effect. The model has been developed to complement the existing analytic tools used at the NBRNM for policy analyses and to improve the understanding of the underlying drivers of the business cycle of the domestic economy.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/08/30/Overview-of-the-New-Calibrated-DSGE-Model-of-the-Economy-of-North-Macedonia-553994,2024-187,"Fri, 30 Aug 2024 ",IMF,8/31/2024

Monetary Policy in Uncertain Times,"Simon C. Smith, Allan Timmermann, Jonathan H. Wright","We investigate the effect of uncertainty surrounding the slope of the Phillips curve on optimal monetary policy. To do this, we first account for parameter uncertainty in a time-invariant Bayesian Phillips curve model. Second, we generalize this model to allow for instabilities in the form of breaks. In both the United States (US) and the European Union (EU), we identify a break around the turn of the century, after which the Phillips curve flattened. Finally, we show how breaks amplify uncertainty in the Phillips curve model, significantly impacting optimal monetary policy. Accounting for breaks causes policymakers to respond more cautiously to deviations in the unemployment rate from its natural rate – as they are less certain about the impact of economic slack on inflation – but to compensate for this increased caution by responding more aggressively to deviations of inflation from its target. Our estimates provide a lower bound for the magnitude of the impact of breaks on the change in responsiveness of optimal monetary policy since they are based on the full sample of data, while policymakers face additional uncertainty as they must continuously determine in real time whether a break has occurred.",https://www.federalreserve.gov//econres/notes/feds-notes/monetary-policy-in-uncertain-times-20240830.html,1.02E+18,30-Aug-24,FED-BOARD-NOTES,8/31/2024
The Declining Mental Health of the Young in the UK,"David G. Blanchflower, Alex Bryson & David N.F. Bell","We show the incidence of mental ill-health has been rising especially among the young in the years and especially so in Scotland.  The incidence of mental ill-health among young men in particular, started rising in 2008 with the onset of the Great Recession and for young women  around 2012. The age profile of mental ill-health shifts to the left, over time, such that the peak of depression shifts from mid-life, when people are in their late 40s and early 50s, around the time of the Great Recession, to one’s early to mid-20s in 2023.  These trends are much more pronounced if one drops the large number of proxy respondents in the UK Labour Force Surveys, indicating fellow family members understate the poor mental health of respondents, especially if those respondents are young. We report consistent evidence from the Scottish Health Surveys and UK samples from Eurobarometer surveys.  Our findings are consistent with those for the United States and suggest that, although smartphone technologies may be closely correlated with a decline in young people’s mental health, increases in mental ill-health in the UK from the late 1990s suggest other factors must also be at play.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32879,32879,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
"Risk, the Limits of Financial Risk Management, and Corporate Resilience",René M. Stulz,"Existing evidence shows convincingly that expected cash flows of non-financial firms can be negatively affected by their total risk, so that non-financial firms can create shareholder wealth by managing their total risk. After reviewing theories that demonstrate links between firm value and total risk, I examine how financial risk management is used to manage firm total risk. I conclude from the evidence that the use of financial risk management is mostly limited to near-term risk in non-financial firms. I offer explanations for this limited role of financial risk management. I argue that the limitations of financial risk management make it important for firms to also focus on resilience and call for more research on the costs and benefits of resilience.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32882,32882,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Pensioners Without Borders: Agglomeration and the Migration Response to Taxation,"Salla Kalin, Antoine B. Levy & Mathilde Muñoz","This paper investigates whether and why pensioners move across borders in response to tax rate differentials. In 2013, retirees relocating to Portugal became eligible to a full tax exemption of foreign-source pensions. Contrary to the broadly held belief that seniors ""age in place"", we find substantial international mobility responses to the reform, concentrated among wealthy and educated pensioners in higher-tax origin countries. The implied migration elasticity of the stock of foreign pensioners to the net-of-tax rate is large (between 1.5 and 2) and increases at longer horizons. Tax-induced retirement migration clusters in space, and exhibits amplification and hysteresis patterns consistent with agglomeration through endogenous amenities. We show such forces theoretically and empirically have significant implications for optimal tax rates, and for the limited efficacy of unilateral policy responses to tax competition, like the source-based taxation of pensions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32890,32890,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Measuring Bias in Job Recommender Systems: Auditing the Algorithms,Shuo Zhang & Peter J. Kuhn,"We audit the job recommender algorithms used by four Chinese job boards by creating fictitious applicant profiles that differ only in their gender.  Jobs recommended uniquely to the male and female profiles in a pair differ modestly in their observed characteristics, with female jobs advertising lower wages, requesting less experience, and coming from smaller firms.  Much larger differences are observed in these ads’ language, however, with women’s jobs containing 0.58 standard deviations more stereotypically female content than men’s. Using our experimental design, we can conclude that these gender gaps are generated primarily by content-based matching algorithms that use the worker’s declared gender as a direct input.  Action-based processes like item-based collaborative filtering and recruiters’ reactions to workers’ resumes contribute little to these gaps.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32889,32889,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Exchange Rate Determination under Limits to CIP Arbitrage,"Philippe Bacchetta, J. Scott Davis & Eric van Wincoop","Recent theories of exchange rate determination have emphasized limited UIP arbitrage by international financial institutions. New regulations since 2008 have also lead to imperfect CIP arbitrage. We show that under limited CIP arbitrage the exchange rate and CIP deviation are jointly determined by equilibrium in the FX spot and swap markets. The model is used to investigate the impact of a wide range of financial shocks. The exchange rate is affected by a new set of financial shocks that operate through the swap market, which have no effect under perfect CIP arbitrage. More familiar financial shocks that impact the spot market have an amplified effect on the exchange rate as a result of their feedback to the swap market. Implications of the model are consistent with a broad range of evidence.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32876,32876,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Markups: A Search-Theoretic Perspective,Guido Menzio,"I derive a formula for the equilibrium distribution of markups in the search- theoretic model of imperfect competition of Butters (1977), Varian (1980), and Burdett and Judd (1983). The level of markups and the sign of the relationship between a seller’s markup and its size depends on the extent of search frictions, as well as on other deep parameters. Markups are efficient. Markups are positive even though the varieties produced by sellers are perfect substitutes. Markups are heterogeneous even when all sellers operate the same production technology. Markups depend on size, even though the substitutability between a variety and the others does not depend on how much of that variety is consumed. Interpreting these markups through the lens of the monopolistic competition model of Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) would lead one to recover incorrect and unstable buyers’ preferences. Interpreting these markups through the lens of the Dixit-Stiglitz model would also leads to incorrect policy recommendations. These results are a cautionary note on recent work in macroeconomics.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32888,32888,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Electric Vehicles and the Energy Transition: Unintended Consequences of a Common Retail Rate Design,"Megan R. Bailey, David P. Brown, Erica Myers, Blake C. Shaffer & Frank A.

We implement a field experiment to assess the effect of time-of-use (TOU) pricing and managed charging on EV charging behavior. We find that while TOU pricing is effective at shifting EV charging into off-peak hours, it unintentionally induces new and larger “shadow peaks” of simultaneous charging. These shadow peaks lead to greater exceedance of local capacity constraints and advance the need for distribution network upgrades. In contrast, centrally managed charging solves the coordination problem, reducing transformer capacity requirements, and is well-tolerated by consumers in our setting.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32886,32886,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Neoclassical Growth Transition Dynamics with One-Sided Commitment,"Dirk Krueger, Fulin Li & Harald Uhlig","This paper characterizes the transition dynamics of a continuous-time neoclassical production economy with capital accumulation in which households face idiosyncratic income risk and cannot commit to repay their debt. Therefore, even though a full set of contingent claims that pay out conditional on the realization of idiosyncratic shocks is available, the equilibrium features imperfect insurance and a non-degenerate cross-sectional consumption distribution. When household labor productivity takes two values, one of which is zero, and the utility function is logarithmic, we characterize the entire transition dynamics induced by unexpected technology shocks, including the evolution of the consumption distribution, in closed form. Thus, the model constitutes an analytically tractable alternative to the standard incomplete markets general equilibrium Aiyagari (1994) model by retaining its physical environment, but replacing the incomplete asset markets structure with one in which limits to consumption insurance emerge endogenously due to limited commitment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32880,32880,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
"Mental Health, Substance Use, and Child Maltreatment","Mir M. Ali, Thanh Lu, Johanna Catherine Maclean & Angélica Meinhofer","Child maltreatment is a pressing concern in the United States, with more than four million children referred to child protective services in 2022. Reducing child maltreatment is a national health objective given the substantial, negative consequences for children who experience maltreatment, both in the short- and long-term. Parental mental health and substance use disorders are strongly associated with child maltreatment. In this study, we use administrative data over the period 2004 to 2021 to study the relationship between the number of mental health and substance use treatment centers per county and child maltreatment reports. Our findings provide evidence that better access to mental health and substance use treatment reduces child maltreatment reports. In particular, an 8% increase in the supply of treatment would reduce maltreatment reports by 1%. These findings suggest that recent and ongoing efforts by the federal government to expand mental health and substance use treatment availability may lead to reduced child maltreatment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32895,32895,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024

Network Competition in the Airline Industry: An Empirical Framework,Zhe Yuan & Panle Jia Barwick,"The Hub-and-Spoke network is a defining feature of the airline industry. This paper is among the first in the literature to introduce an empirical framework for analyzing network competition among airlines. Airlines make market entry decisions and choose flight frequencies in the first stage, followed by price competition to attract passengers in the second stage. A key feature of this model is the linkage between direct and indirect flights, which is described by a technological relationship (and estimated using data) that proxies the Hub-and-Spoke network. The paper estimates the marginal costs of serving passengers and operating flights using first-order conditions, bounds the entry costs using inequalities derived from the reveal-preference argument, and employs a state-of-the-art econometric method to conduct inference for entry cost parameters. Ignoring network externality underestimates the benefits of operating an additional flight by 13.2%, and airlines would schedule 21.53% fewer one-stop flights had they made flight operation decisions independently for each market. To evaluate the impact of a hypothetical merger, the paper proposes a novel equilibrium concept that makes it feasible to compute the industry equilibria. Counterfactual analyses indicate that a hypothetical merger between Alaska and Virgin America would increase consumer surplus as the merged airline would offer direct flights in 10% more markets while the overall post-merger price effect would likely be muted.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32893,32893,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
"Conviction, Incarceration, and Recidivism: Understanding the Revolving Door","John Eric Humphries, Aurelie Ouss, Kamelia Stavreva, Megan T. Stevenson & Winnie van Dijk","Noncarceral conviction is a common outcome of criminal court cases: for every individual incarcerated, there are approximately three who are recently convicted but not sentenced to prison or jail. We develop an empirical framework for studying the consequences of noncarceral conviction by extending the binary-treatment judge IV framework to settings with multiple treatments. We outline assumptions under which widely-used 2SLS regressions recover margin-specific treatment effects, relate these assumptions to models of judge decision-making, and derive an expression that provides intuition about the direction and magnitude of asymptotic bias when they are not met. Under the identifying assumptions, we find that noncarceral conviction (relative to dismissal) leads to a large and long-lasting increase in recidivism for felony defendants in Virginia. In contrast, incarceration relative to noncarceral conviction leads to a short-run reduction in recidivism, consistent with incapacitation. While the identifying assumptions include a strong restriction on judge decision-making, we argue that any bias resulting from its failure is unlikely to change our qualitative conclusions. Lastly, we introduce an alternative empirical strategy, and find that it yields similar estimates. Collectively, these results suggest that noncarceral felony conviction is an important and potentially overlooked driver of recidivism.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32894,32894,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
"Movements in Yields, not the Equity Premium: Bernanke-Kuttner Redux",Stefan Nagel & Zhengyang Xu,"We show that the stock market price reaction to monetary policy surprises upon announcements of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is explained mostly by changes in the default-free term structure of yields, not by changes in the equity premium. We reach this conclusion based on a new model-free method that uses dividend futures prices to obtain the counterfactual stock market index price change that results purely from the change in the default-free yield curve induced by the monetary policy surprise. The yield curve change in turn partly reflects a change in expected future short-term interest rates, as measured by changes in professional forecasts, and partly a change in the term premium. We further find that the even/odd week FOMC cycle in stock index returns is also largely due to an FOMC cycle in the yield curve rather than the equity premium.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32884,32884,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Gender Diversity in Academic Entrepreneurship: Social Impact Motives and the NSF I-Corps Program,"April Burrage, Nilanjana Dasgupta & Ina Ganguli","This study examines gender differences in the social impact and commercial motives for academic entrepreneurship using the National Science Foundation's Innovation Corps (NSF I-Corps) program. I-Corps provides experiential entrepreneurship training to faculty and graduate student researchers at local I-Corps university sites and through a nationwide program. Since the inception of I-Corps, only 20% of participants have been women. We first use survey data from one I-Corps university site to show that women participants had higher social entrepreneurial intentions compared to commercial entrepreneurial intentions, and these social entrepreneurial intentions were higher than men’s. We then extend and generalize this finding by analyzing 1,267 publicly available project summaries from the National I-Corps Program from 2012-2019. We find that women PIs’ I-Corps project proposals emphasized social impact significantly more than men PIs, while projects for all PIs emphasized commercial impact to a similar degree. We next ran a field experiment to estimate the causal impact of social impact vs. commercial motives by experimentally manipulating the recruitment email messages inviting researchers to participate in the I-Corps training program. We find that women were more likely to show interest in a social impact version of a message compared to a commercial version, while men showed equal interest in both types of messages. Taken together, our results indicate that women are more interested in pursuing commercialization and entrepreneurship activities when they are tackling societal problems. They suggest that low-cost interventions that emphasize the social impact value of entrepreneurial opportunities may increase gender diversity in entrepreneurship activities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32885,32885,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Industrial Composition of Syndicated Loans and Banks' Climate Commitments,"Galina Hale, Brigid Meisenbacher & Fernanda Nechio","In the past two decades, a number of banks joined global initiatives aimed to mitigate climate change by “greening” their asset portfolios. We study whether banks that made such commitments have a different emission exposure of their portfolios of syndicated loans than banks that did not. We rely on loan-level information with global coverage combined with country-industry information on emissions. We find that all banks have reduced their loan-emission exposures over the last 8 years. However, we do not find differences between banks that did and those that did not signal their sustainability goals, with the exception of early signers of Principles of Responsible Investments (PRI), who already had lower exposure to emissions through their syndicated lending. In addition, banks that signed PRI shortened the maturity of the loans extended to highly-emitting industries but only temporarily. Thus, we conclude that banks reduced their exposure to climate transition risks on average, but voluntary climate commitments did not contribute to syndicated loan reallocation away from highly-emitting sectors.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32874,32874,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Too Much of a Good Thing? How Narrow Targeting and Policy Interactions Influence Responses to California’s EITC,David Neumark & Zeyu Li,"California has the highest Earned Income Tax (EITC) supplement to the federal EITC, with an 85% supplement rate. However, we find that despite the apparent generosity of the California EITC, there is no employment effect on less-skilled single mothers, in sharp contrast to the evidence of positive extensive margin effects of other state EITC supplements, and of the federal EITC. Our analysis points to two reasons why, unlike other EITCs, California’s EITC does not appear to have an extensive margin effect. First, most states simply supplement the federal EITC by a fixed percentage. In contrast, in California the maximum credit is reached at a much lower income level, the state EITC begins to phase out as soon as the maximum EITC payment is reached (i.e., there is no plateau), and the phase-out rate is as steep as the phase-in rate. The result is a much higher marginal tax rate that sets in at a much lower income level. Second, California has a very high (and rising) minimum wage. The interaction between a high minimum wage and the unique budget constraint created by the California EITC implies that workers who work more than a relatively low number of hours are unlikely to gain any extra income because of the EITC.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32883,32883,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024

Drivers of Racial Differences in C-Sections,"Adriana Corredor-Waldron, Janet Currie & Molly Schnell","Black mothers with unscheduled deliveries are 25 percent more likely to deliver by C-section than non-Hispanic white mothers. The gap is highest for mothers with the lowest risk and is reduced by only four percentage points when controlling for observed medical risk factors, sociodemographic characteristics, hospital, and doctor or medical practice group. Remarkably, the gap disappears when the costs of ordering an unscheduled C-section are higher due to the unscheduled delivery occurring at the same time as a scheduled C-section. This finding is consistent with provider discretion—rather than differences in unobserved medical risk—accounting for persistent racial disparities in delivery method. The additional C-sections that take place for low-risk women when hospitals are unconstrained negatively impact maternal and infant health.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32891,32891,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Capital Controls on Outflows: New Evidence and a Theoretical Framework,"Roberto Chang, Andrés Fernández & Humberto Martinez","We study capital controls on outflows (CCOs) in situations of macroeconomic and financial distress. We present novel empirical evidence indicating that CCO implementation is associated with crises and declines in GDP growth. We then develop a theoretical framework that is consistent with such empirical findings and also yields policy and welfare lessons. The theory features costly coordination failures by foreign investors which can sometimes be avoided by suitably tailored CCOs. The benefits of CCOs as coordination devices can make them optimal even if CCOs entail deadweight losses; if the latter are large, however, CCOs are detrimental for welfare. We show that optimal CCOs can suffer from time inconsistency, and also how political opportunism may limit CCO policy. Hence government credibility and reputation building emerge as critical for the successful implementation of CCOs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32877,32877,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Innovation Networks in the Industrial Revolution,"Lukas Rosenberger, W. Walker Hanlon & Carl Hallmann","How did Britain sustain faster rates of economic growth than comparable European countries, such as France, during the Industrial Revolution? We argue that Britain possessed an important but underappreciated innovation advantage: British inventors worked in technologies that were more central within the innovation network. We offer a new approach for measuring the innovation network using patent data from Britain and France in the late-18th and early-19th century. We show that the network influenced innovation outcomes and demonstrate that British inventors worked in more central technologies within the innovation network than French inventors. Drawing on recently developed theoretical tools, and using a novel estimation strategy, we quantify the implications for technology growth rates in Britain compared to France. Our results indicate that the shape of the innovation network, and the location of British inventors within it, explains an important share of the more rapid technological change and industrial growth in Britain during the Industrial Revolution.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32875,32875,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Cash Bail and Trial Outcomes in an Early Twentieth-Century Southern Police Court,Howard Bodenhorn,"Studies of modern misdemeanor adjudication find that courts set bail higher than is required to reasonably assure that nonviolent defendants who pose no immediate threat to the community will appear for trial. Some defendants languish in jail for extended periods during which time they lose income, employment, and the ability to provide an effective defense for themselves. This paper considers the downstream consequences of bail setting in an urban, southern police court in the 1910s. I find that defendants unwilling or unable to post cash bail were not more likely to be convicted or to be incarcerated than defendants who posted bail. Conditional on conviction, however, defendants who posted bail and returned for their hearings were about half as likely to serve time. Among those who served time, defendants who posted bail served just 6 percent as much time as defendants who did not post bail.  The ability to post bail was correlated with unobserved income or wealth and I find evidence that defendants who did not post bail and served on the chain gang were employed in low-income jobs and likely faced a binding cash-in-advance constraint.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32887,32887,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024
Inflation and Treasury Convenience,"Anna Cieslak, Wenhao Li & Carolin Pflueger","Using a century of data, we show that Treasury convenience yield and inflation comove positively during the inflationary 1970s-1980s, but negatively pre-WWII and post-2000. An inflation decomposition reveals that higher supply inflation predicts higher convenience, while lower demand inflation follows higher convenience. In our model, inflationary cost-push shocks raise the opportunity cost of holding money and money-like assets, inducing higher convenience, as in 1970s-1980s. Conversely, liquidity demand shocks drive up convenience but lower consumption demand and inflation in the model, as pre-WWII and post-2000. By linking the evidence to macroeconomic drivers, our results challenge the notion that inflation directly depresses Treasury convenience.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32881,32881,24-Sep,NBER,9/2/2024

A High-Frequency Measure of Income Inequality,"Marie Hogan, Laura E. Jackson, and Michael T. Owyang","To identify shocks in VARs using short-run sign or exclusion restrictions, the highest-frequency data possible is usually preferred. For income inequality, there is tension between high frequency and high quality. Annual datasets that survey large numbers of people provide high-quality estimates of income. Higher frequency surveys generally provide a sparser sampling of individual income. Some previous studies have used the the higher frequency data, presumably to match the frequency necessary to identify the shock. Using data obtained from the higher frequency, lower respondant surveys might result in misleading conclusions. We combine the two surveys and construct a set of quarterly-frequency income quantiles that are scaled to the annual data but fluctuate according to the high-frequency survey. We show that using these data yields very different economic conclusions than simply using the raw high-frequency income series. In particular, we show in two simple applications to technology shocks and house price shocks that one obtains different conclusions about the permanence and/or the direction of the responses of income inequality.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-021,2024-021A,24-Sep,FED-STLOUIS,9/6/2024

Income Differences and Health Disparities: Roles of Preventive vs. Curative Medicine,Serdar Ozkan,"Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) I find that early in life the rich spend significantly more on health care, whereas from middle to very old age the poor outspend the rich by 25% in the US. Furthermore, while low-income individuals are less likely to incur medical expenses, they are more prone to experiencing extreme expenses when they do seek care. To account for these facts, I develop and estimate a life-cycle model of two types of health capital: physical and preventive. Physical health capital determines survival probabilities, whereas preventive health capital governs the distribution of shocks to physical health capital, thereby controlling life expectancy. Moreover, I incorporate key features of the US health care system, including private and public health insurance. Because of their lower marginal utility of consumption the rich spend more on preventive care, resulting in milder health shocks (and lower curative medical expenditures) in old age compared to the poor. Notably, public insurance—which by design covers large expenditures—amplifies these differences by hampering the poor’s incentives to invest in preventive health. Therefore, the model also implies a widening life expectancy gap between income groups in response to rising inequality. Policy experiments suggest that expanding health insurance coverage and subsidizing preventive care to encourage health care use by the poor early in life can generate substantial welfare gains, even when accounting for the higher taxes required to finance them.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-025,2023-025D,24-Aug,FED-STLOUIS,9/6/2024
Nonlinear Phillips Curves,"Simon C. Smith, Allan Timmermann, Jonathan H. Wright","The slope of the Phillips curve flattened around the turn of the century. The slope, however, is also kinked (nonlinear) such that it is steeper in a tight labor market than in a more normal one. The magnitude of this kink means that the flattening of the Phillips curve around the turn of the century has not changed much the slope in a tight labor market. This holds for both price and wage Phillips curves and for both the United States (US) and the European Union (EU).

Managing Remittances Inflows with Foreign Exchange Intervention,Maria-Angels Oliva ; Nika Khinashvili,"In a 157 emerging markets and developing countries sample, remittances continue to grow fast, outpacing other financial inflows (as a share of GDP), particularly in Asia. Without alternative policy instruments, foreign exchange interventions (FXIs) have often been the authorities’ go-to tool to manage the short-term effects of these remittance inflows. However, this practice comes at a cost. This paper shows that FXIs are quick, temporary solutions that often may hinder the development of the recipient country’s financial sector and may not support financial stability over the medium term. The analysis suggests that FXIs act as an insurance tool that, by mitigating FX volatility, protect remittance recipients and tradable sectors from FX risks, encouraging less bank deposits (consistent with more spending) and lower buffers in the banking sector. These costs add to other direct FXI-related costs already identified in the literature. The development of private sector market risk management tools should support longer-term structural reforms required to increase the absorptive capacity of additional FX inflows.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/09/06/Managing-Remittances-Inflows-with-Foreign-Exchange-Intervention-554229,2024-191,"Fri, 06 Sep 2024 ",IMF,9/7/2024

Regime-Switching Factor Models and Nowcasting with Big Data,Omer Faruk Akbal,"This paper is concerned with nowcasting in a setting involving a large dataset with mixed frequencies, missing data problems, and regime-switching over time. I show that the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm provides satisfactory performance relative to other estimation methods and delivers a good tradeoff between accuracy and speed, which makes it especially useful for real-time applications involving large dimensional data. The methodology solves the closed-form solutions to the parameter estimators instead of relying on numerical maximization routines. In an application to vintage US data, I show that the regime-switching modification promises improved forecasting performance. The regime-switching model demonstrates superior nowcasting performance, particularly when key economic indicators are released. In addition, the model is able to closely match the recession dating of the NBER despite having less information than actual committee meetings. In a backcasting exercise, I show that the fit between actual NBER recession dates and model recession estimates becomes more apparent with the additional available information. Finally, I discuss the policy implications of regime-switching nowcasting model, by allowing central bankers to evaluate whether the economy is subject to an upcoming recession or experiencing a persistent or transitory inflationary regime, gives the opportunity to act preemptively, more hawkish or dovish if necessary.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/09/06/Regime-Switching-Factor-Models-and-Nowcasting-with-Big-Data-554116,2024-190,"Fri, 06 Sep 2024 ",IMF,9/7/2024
How do Economic Growth and Food Inflation Affect Food Insecurity?,Christian Bogmans ; Andrea Pescatori ; Ervin Prifti,"During the global recession of 2020 food insecurity increased substantially in many countries around the world. Fortunately, the surge in food insecurity quickly came to a halt as the world economy returned to its positive growth path, despite double-digit domestic food inflation in most countries. To shed light on the relative importance of income growth and food inflation in driving food insecurity, we employ a heterogeneous-agent model with income inequality, complemented by novel cross-country data for the period 2001-2021. We use external instruments (changes in commodity terms-of-trade, external economic growth, and harvest shocks) to isolate exogenous variation in domestic income growth and ood inflation. Our findings suggest that income growth is the dominant driver of annual variations in food insecurity, while food price inflation plays a somewhat smaller role, aligning with our model predictions.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/09/06/How-do-Economic-Growth-and-Food-Inflation-Affect-Food-Insecurity-554563,2024-188,"Fri, 06 Sep 2024 ",IMF,9/7/2024

Failing Banks,"Sergio Correia, Stephan Luck, and Emil Verner","Why do banks fail? We create a panel covering most commercial banks from 1865 through 2023 to study the history of failing banks in the United States. Failing banks are characterized by rising asset losses, deteriorating solvency, and an increasing reliance on expensive non-core funding. Commonalities across failing banks imply that failures are highly predictable using simple accounting metrics from publicly available financial statements. Predictability is high even in the absence of deposit insurance, when depositor runs were common. Bank-level fundamentals also forecast aggregate waves of bank failures during systemic banking crises. Altogether, our evidence suggests that the ultimate cause of bank failures and banking crises is almost always and everywhere a deterioration of bank fundamentals. Bank runs can be rejected as a plausible cause of failure for most failures in the history of the U.S. and are most commonly a consequence of imminent failure. Depositors tend to be slow to react to an increased risk of bank failure, even in the absence of deposit insurance.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1117,1117,9/5/2024,FED-NEWYORK,9/7/2024
Firm financial conditions and the transmission of monetary policy,"Thiago R T Ferreira, Daniel A Ostry and John Rogers","We re-examine how financial frictions shape the transmission of monetary policy using firms’ excess bond premia (EBPs), the risk premium component of credit spreads. While monetary policy easing shocks compress credit spreads more for higher-EBP (riskier) firms, lower-EBP firms’ investment responds more. Further, credit supply shocks replicate monetary policy’s heterogeneous effects, whereas credit demand shocks elicit homogeneous firm responses. A model with financial frictions in which lower-EBP firms have flatter marginal benefit curves for capital rationalises firms’ price and quantity reactions to these three shocks. In contrast, previously examined channels, while complementary, are inconsistent with our more comprehensive set of empirical moments.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/firm-financial-conditions-and-the-transmission-of-monetary-policy,1093,"Fri, 06 Sep 2024 ",BOE,9/7/2024
Geopolitical Alignment and the Use of Global Currencies,Jakree Koosakul ; Longmei Zhang ; Maryam Zia,"After decades of increasing global economic integration, the world is facing a growing risk of geoeconomic fragmentation, with potentially far-reaching implications for the global economy and the international monetary system. Against this background, this paper studies how geopolitical proximity, along with other economic factors, affects the usage of five SDR currencies in cross-border transactions. Since World War II, the global currency landscape has remained relatively stable, with the U.S. dollar serving as the dominant currency. Using country-level SWIFT transaction data, our analysis confirms the importance of inertia, trade and financial linkages in shaping the currency landscape, consistent with existing studies. On geopolitical proximity, we find that closer proximity can boost the use of the euro and renminbi, notably among emerging market and developing economies, although the impact is rather muted in the full sample. The effect on RMB usage in the full sample is more pronounced during periods of heightened trade policy uncertainty. These findings suggest that in a more geoeconomically fragmented world, alternative currencies could play a greater role.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/09/06/Geopolitical-Alignment-and-the-Use-of-Global-Currencies-554242,2024-189,"Fri, 06 Sep 2024 ",IMF,9/7/2024

Adapting to Misspecification,"Timothy Armstrong, Patrick M. Kline & Liyang Sun","Empirical research typically involves a robustness-efficiency tradeoff. A researcher seeking to estimate a scalar parameter can invoke strong assumptions to motivate a restricted estimator that is precise but may be heavily biased, or they can relax some of these assumptions to motivate a more robust, but variable, unrestricted estimator. When a bound on the bias of the restricted estimator is available, it is optimal to shrink the unrestricted estimator towards the restricted estimator. For settings where a bound on the bias of the restricted estimator is unknown, we propose adaptive estimators that minimize the percentage increase in worst case risk relative to an oracle that knows the bound. We show that adaptive estimators solve a weighted convex minimax problem and provide lookup tables facilitating their rapid computation. Revisiting some well known empirical studies where questions of model specification arise, we examine the advantages of adapting to—rather than testing for—misspecification.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32906,32906,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
The Complexities of Differential Privacy for Survey Data,Jörg Drechsler & James Bailie,"The concept of differential privacy (DP) has gained substantial attention in recent years, most notably since the U.S. Census Bureau announced the adoption of the concept for its 2020 Decennial Census. However, despite its attractive theoretical properties, implementing DP in practice remains challenging, especially when it comes to survey data. In this paper we present some results from an ongoing project funded by the U.S. Census Bureau that is exploring the possibilities and limitations of DP for survey data. Specifically, we identify five aspects that need to be considered when adopting DP in the survey context: the multi-staged nature of data production; the limited privacy amplification from complex sampling designs; the implications of survey-weighted estimates; the weighting adjustments for nonresponse and other data deficiencies, and the imputation of missing values. We summarize the project’s key findings with respect to each of these aspects and also discuss some of the challenges that still need to be addressed before DP could become the new data protection standard at statistical agencies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32905,32905,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
Instrumental Variables with Unobserved Heterogeneity in Treatment Effects,Magne Mogstad & Alexander Torgovitsky,"This chapter synthesizes and critically reviews the modern instrumental variables (IV) literature that allows for unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects (UHTE). We start by discussing why UHTE is often an essential aspect of IV applications in economics and we explain the conceptual challenges raised by allowing for it. Then we review and survey two general strategies for incorporating UHTE. The first strategy is to continue to use linear IV estimators designed for classical constant (homogeneous) treatment effect models, acknowledge their likely misspecification, and attempt to reverse engineer an attractive interpretation in the presence of UHTE. This strategy commonly leads to interpretations of linear IV that involve local average treatment effects (LATEs). We review the various ways in which the use and justification of LATE interpretations have expanded and contracted since their introduction in the early 1990s. The second strategy is to forward engineer new estimators that explicitly allow for UHTE. This strategy has its roots in the Gronau-Heckman selection model of the 1970s, ideas from which have been revitalized through marginal treatment effects (MTE) analysis. We discuss implementation of MTE methods and draw connections with related control function and bounding methods that are scattered throughout the econometric and causal inference literature.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32927,32927,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
"Trade, Innovation and Firm Financing","Paul Bergin, Ling Feng & Ching-Yi Lin","While the trade literature has tended to view export activity and innovation as complementary activities, we present evidence that financial constraints are a reason the two activities can act as substitutes for small exporters. In particular, we find that small exporters have lower expenditure on R&D than comparable non-exporters, and we find a corresponding pattern in the leverage ratio of the capital structure of small firms. A model that combines firm decisions regarding the amount of innovation, exporting, and endogenous financial capital structure is able to account for these empirical findings. The model implies that small firms are unable to fully reap the gains from exporting due to financial constraints, as they reduce R&D to finance the costs of export participation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32904,32904,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024

We conduct a randomized controlled trial of one such program. Participants randomly assigned to intensive, holistic, wrap-around services have 10 percentage points higher employment rates after one year compared with a control group offered only help with an immediate need. Most of this effect appears to persist after programming ends. However, we find limited evidence that intensive, holistic services affect areas beyond employment, even when other areas of life are participants’ primary goals. We find some evidence that the program works by increasing hopefulness and agency among participants, which may be more useful in supporting labor force participation than in meeting other goals.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32911,32911,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024

Households differ in type-specific, state-contingent labor productivity and initial firm ownership, yet markets are complete. The fiscal authority has access to a linear tax schedule with non-state-contingent tax rates and uniform, lump-sum taxes (or transfers). We derive sufficient conditions under which implementing flexible-price allocations is optimal. We then show that when there are fluctuations in relative labor productivity across households, it is optimal for monetary policy to abandon the flexible-price benchmark and target a state-contingent markup. The optimal markup covaries positively with a sufficient statistic for labor income inequality. In a calibrated version of the model, countercyclical earnings inequality implies countercyclical optimal markups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32921,32921,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
Businesses and Borrowing during the Roaring ‘20s and at the Onset of the Great Depression,Gary Richardson & Marco Del Angel,"Which firms relied on commercial banks for credit and which firms did not at the onset of the Great Depression would seem to be an important question given the vast literature discussing banking distress in the United States during the 1930s. The question, however, has not been answered. This essay addresses that issue by analyzing data from an Internal Revenue Service publication, Statistics of Income. The hitherto unexplored data reveals that small firms in all industries borrowed heavily from commercial banks and relied on them for credit necessary to fund ongoing operations. The largest firms in most sectors deposited more in banks than they borrowed from them. Sectors whose firms depended most on commercial banks for credit were wholesaling, retailing, services, and the processing of agricultural products.

Invoicing Currency and Exchange Rate Pass-Through in Japanese Imports: A Panel VAR Analysis,"Taiyo Yoshimi, Uraku Yoshimoto, Takatoshi Ito, Kiyotaka Sato, Junko Shimizu & Yushi Yoshida","This study utilizes the granular Japanese customs data from 2014 to 2020 to examine the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to Japanese import prices. It mainly focuses on the impact of the invoicing currency choice on ERPT. The ERPT elasticity in products invoiced in the exporter’s currency is greater than those invoiced in yen. In the full sample analysis, the ERPT elasticity was 0.75 for products invoiced in the exporter’s currency, compared to about 0.19 for yen-invoiced products. We find the same tendency for imports from two Asian powerhouses: China and Thailand. There is no significant difference in the ERPT elasticity between products invoiced in the exporter’s currency and those invoiced in a third currency (i.e., a currency other than yen or the exporter’s currency). In addition, an asymmetric pass-through is found, namely the ERPT during the appreciation phase of the yen is higher than during the depreciation phase.

Jha, Neumark and Rodriguez-Lopez (2024, JNR) claim that looking within multi-state commuting zones and using County Business Patterns data provides a superior approach to DLR and does find disemployment effects. We show that JNR’s results are confounded by parallel trends violations in the 1990s, when minimum wage events were rare and small in magnitude; JNR’s outmoded two-way-fixed-effects model amplifies the biases introduced by these violations. Our estimates using their specifications and data on only post-2000 data fail to detect disemployment effects. The same results hold using QCEW and ACS datasets. Our preferred event study difference-in-differences approach, which analyzes only data that fall clearly within an event’s window, also does not detect negative employment effects. This result holds whether we compare across all states, look within commuting zones or within border county pairs, and regardless of the data set or time period.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32902,32902,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
Federal Pandemic Relief and Academic Recovery,"Dan C. Dewey, Erin M. Fahle, Thomas J. Kane, Sean F. Reardon & Douglas O. Staiger","We measure the effect of district use of federal pandemic relief during the 2022-23 school year for a sample of more than 5000 districts in 29 states. We rely on several plausibly exogenous sources of variation in federal grants: differences in state Title I funding formulas, estimation error in Census local area poverty rates and differences in eligibility for federal Title I and subsidized lunch eligibility. We find that each $1000 in spending per student was associated with a .0086 SD improvement in math and a .0049 SD improvement in reading. Both are consistent with a recent meta-analysis of spending impacts by Jackson and Mackevicius (2023). As a placebo test, we find no relationship between federal dollars that were not yet spent during the 2022-23 year. We also find similar results using synthetic control group methods to compare high-poverty districts with high and low amounts of federal aid, but with similar trends in achievement through 2022. Because the federal aid was targeted at higher poverty districts, we find the federal dollars not only contributed to the recovery, but also helped narrow the gaps in achievement which had widened during the pandemic.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32897,32897,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
Failing Banks,"Sergio A. Correia, Stephan Luck & Emil Verner","Why do banks fail? We create a panel covering most commercial banks from 1865 through 2023 to study the history of failing banks in the United States. Failing banks are characterized by rising asset losses, deteriorating solvency, and an increasing reliance on expensive non-core funding. Commonalities across failing banks imply that failures are highly predictable using simple accounting metrics from publicly available financial statements. Predictability is high even in the absence of deposit insurance, when depositor runs were common. Bank-level fundamentals also forecast aggregate waves of bank failures during systemic banking crises. Altogether, our evidence suggests that the ultimate cause of bank failures and banking crises is almost always and everywhere a deterioration of bank fundamentals. Bank runs can be rejected as a plausible cause of failure for most failures in the history of the U.S. and are most commonly a consequence of imminent failure. Depositors tend to be slow to react to an increased risk of bank failure, even in the absence of deposit insurance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32907,32907,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
Own-Wage Elasticity: Quantifying the Impact of Minimum Wages on Employment,Arindrajit Dube & Ben Zipperer,"The own-wage elasticity (OWE) of employment estimated using minimum wage increases provides an economically meaningful measure of the policy on jobs. We discuss how to interpret the magnitude of the OWE, including in terms of welfare and under alternative models of the labor market. We present a comprehensive set of OWE estimates from 88 studies and introduce an regularly updated repository of the estimates---https://economic.github.io/owe---an up-to-date snapshot of the existing literature for scholars and policymakers. We find that most studies to date suggest a fairly modest impact of minimum wages on jobs: the median OWE estimate of 72 studies published in academic journals is -0.13, which suggests that only around 13 percent of the potential earnings gains from minimum wage increases are offset due to associated job losses.

Monetary policy optimally focuses on aggregate stabilization, but deviates from a zero-inflation target; in a model calibration to the U.S., however, it effectively approximates a zero-inflation target.

Wildfire smoke is pervasive and produces air quality shocks of varying intensity, depending on wind patterns and plume thickness. Using administrative Medicare records for 2007–2019, we estimate that wildfire smoke accounts for 18% of ambient PM2.5 concentrations, 0.42% of deaths, and 0.69% of emergency room visits among adults aged 65 and over. Smaller pollution shocks have outsized health impacts, indicating significant health benefits from improving air quality, even in areas meeting current regulatory standards.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32924,32924,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
The Case for Researching Applied Privacy Enhancing Technologies,"Claire M. Bowen, Joshua Snoke, Aaron R. Williams & Andrés F.

This increased interest has led to extensive theoretical and methodological research, but the number of practical applications of privacy enhancing technologies has lagged far behind. This paper provides an overview of the Safe Data Technologies Project and the approach we have taken to conducting privacy research with the specific aim of putting theory into practice and incorporating user input. We provide an overview of the broader project goals, which aim to safely expand access to administrative tax data that is currently highly restricted.

Understanding the Impact of Low-Cost Loans on Forced Labor,Anisha Sharma ⓡ Manisha Shah ⓡ Beata Łuczywek,"Approximately 27.5 million individuals fell victim to forced labor in 2021. The Indian construction industry is particularly vulnerable to forced labor as workers experience excessive work hours, required work on rest days, and unpaid wages. Micro-contractors (MCs), who oversee worker environments, frequently struggle with their own financial constraints due to limited access to working capital. This study investigates whether alleviating MC liquidity constraints improves labor conditions for their workers in Bengaluru and Delhi by offering randomly selected MCs access to low-cost loans. Our findings reveal this intervention does not improve working conditions overall; in fact, some outcomes slightly worsen. However, workers employed by more educated and non-migrant treatment MCs experience significantly better labor conditions, underscoring important heterogeneity among MCs. This research offers new causal insights into efforts to combat forced labor.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32912,32912,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
Effective Regulation and Firm Compliance: The Case of German Privacy Policies,"Jacopo Gambato, Bernhard Ganglmair & Julia K. Krämer","This chapter explores the interaction between the enforcement of and compliance with difficult-to-enforce rules in the context of data regulation. We focus on the effect of the introduction of the GDPR and its transparency principle on the readability of privacy policies for a large sample of German firms. Germany has a system of state-level data protection authorities. These data regulators enforce the same rules but face diverse funding situations, allowing for an ideal setting to study the role of a regulator's capacity in firms' compliance decisions. We find that while, on average, the GDPR lead to less readable policies, firms active in industries that have in the past received more regulatory scrutiny and those active in jurisdictions of better-funded data regulators exhibit a stronger compliance with the GDPR's readability requirement. These results exemplify a more general interaction between regulators' enforcement activity and firms' regulatory compliance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32913,32913,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
Gender Reveals in the Labor Market: Evidence on Gender Signaling and Statistical Discrimination in an Online Health Care Market,"Haoran He, David Neumark & Qian Weng","A recent approach to testing for customer statistical discrimination involves studying price gaps between sellers from different gender, race, or ethnic groups and how they evolve as buyers obtain more information about seller quality. We consider a similar setting, testing for statistical discrimination against female doctors in an online health care market. But we show that this kind of analysis does not provide evidence on statistical discrimination in this setting because doctors have a choice about how strongly to signal gender. We develop a new approach to identifying statistical discrimination using doctors’ choices about signaling their gender. We find evidence of statistical discrimination against female doctors in male-dominated fields, and against male doctors in female-dominated fields. In particular, female doctors mask gender more strongly initially in male-dominated fields, and male doctors do the same in female-dominated fields. But in both female- and male-dominated fields the gender gap in signaling decreases with number of customer reviews of doctors. More generally, our evidence indicates how, in some markets, sellers may be able to reduce statistical discrimination by masking their group membership.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32929,32929,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
Racial Differences in the Total Rate of Return on Owner-Occupied Housing,Rebecca Diamond & William F.

We develop a new method to estimate the rental value of each owner-occupied house, using a house's resale value to proxy for unobservable quality.  Black and Hispanic homeowners earn higher but more volatile rates of return than White homeowners, due in part to higher rental yields.  These differences are largely explained by household income and education differences.   Including returns on properties that do not transact in sample is crucial to accurately measure racial differences in total rates of return.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32916,32916,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024

We benchmark a widely used credit score against a machine learning model of consumer default and find significant misclassification of borrowers, especially those with low scores.

"Democracy, Capitalism, and Equality: The Importance of Impersonal Rules",Naomi R. Lamoreaux & John Joseph Wallis,"We usually consider it progress when a country begins to shift from an autocratic to a democratic form of government.  However, the introduction of elections and other early trappings of democracy often has the perverse effect of exacerbating political instability.  It also increases the incentives for those in power to manipulate the economy for political ends and thus often negatively affects economic growth.  We argue that the key to getting beyond these pernicious effects—to reconciling democracy and capitalism—is to move to a governance structure based on impersonal rules that apply in the same way to everyone (or at least to broad categories of everyone).  We lay out the theoretical basis for this argument and illustrate it with evidence about how the transformation worked (or not) in the case of the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32930,32930,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
Skills and Human Capital in the Labor Market,David J. Deming & Mikko I. Silliman,"This paper synthesizes the economics literature on skills and human capital, with a particular focus on higher-order capacities like social and decision-making skills. We review the empirical evidence on returns to human capital from both a micro and macro perspective, as well as the evidence on returns to human capital investment over the life-cycle. We highlight two key limitations of human capital theory as currently implemented. First, prior work mostly assumes that human capital is one-dimensional and can be measured by education or test scores alone. Second, human capital is typically modeled as augmenting the marginal product of labor with workers being treated as factors of production, just like physical capital. We argue for a new approach that treats workers as agents who decide how to allocate their labor over job tasks. Traditional cognitive skills make workers more productive in any task, while higher-order skills govern workers’ choices of which tasks to perform and whether to work alone or in a team. We illustrate the value of this approach with stylized models that incorporate teamwork and decision-making skills and generate predictions about how returns to skills vary across contexts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32908,32908,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
An Anatomy of Currency Strategies: The Role of Emerging Markets,"Mikhail Chernov, Magnus Dahlquist & Lars A. Lochstoer","We show that a small set of emerging markets with floating exchange rates expand the investment frontier substantially relative to G10 currencies. The frontier is characterized by an out-of-sample mean-variance efficient portfolio that prices G10- and emerging markets-based trading strategies unconditionally as well as conditionally. Our approach reveals that returns to prominent trading strategies are largely driven by factors that do not command a risk premium. After real-time hedging of such unpriced risks, the Sharpe ratios of these strategies increase substantially, providing new benchmarks for currency pricing models. For instance, the Sharpe ratio of the carry strategy increases from 0.71 to 1.29. The unpriced risks are related to geographically-based currency factors, while the priced risk that drives currency risk premiums is related to aggregate consumption exposure.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32900,32900,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
"Is Broader Always Better? Preexisting Distortions, Emissions Elasticities, and the Scope of Emissions Pricing","Lawrence H. Goulder, Marc A.C. Hafstead & Roberton C. Williams III","Economists often regard broad-based carbon pricing (whether in the form of a carbon tax or cap and trade) as the most efficient policy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Relative to a narrower policy that exempts some emissions sources, a broader policy is often favored because it can exploit more low-cost emissions reduction opportunities and cause less emissions leakage to uncovered sources. Yet narrower approaches have gained considerable political support, partly because they avoid price increases for outputs (such as gasoline) regarded as especially critical to household budgets. Some analysts might lament any departure from broad carbon pricing, citing efficiency costs. This paper offers theory and numerical simulations revealing that such a shift need not sacrifice efficiency. This result reflects differences across sectors in distortions from preexisting taxes and in the elasticity of emissions with respect to the carbon price. Our analytical model reveals that a narrower policy that exploits these differences can be more cost-effective than a policy with a broad, economy-wide tax base. Our numerical model of the US economy compares quantitatively the effects of an economy-wide carbon price with those of several narrower policies, including one that applies only to the power sector, one that exempts gasoline, and one that exempts energy-intensive trade-exposed industries. We compare policies under alternative specifications for policy stringency and find that the broader policy always becomes more cost-effective at sufficiently high stringency.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32915,32915,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
What’s Across the Border? Re-Evaluating the Cross-Border Evidence on Minimum Wage Effects,"Priyaranjan Jha, David Neumark & Antonio Rodriguez-Lopez","Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010) argue that state-level minimum wage variation correlated with economic shocks generates spurious evidence that higher minimum wages reduce employment. Using minimum wage variation within contiguous county pairs sharing a state border, they find no relationship between minimum wages and employment in the U.S. restaurant industry. Using the same research design, we show that this result is overturned if we use instead multi-state commuting zones, which provide superior definitions of local economic areas. These contrasting results are explained by a positive bias in the county-pair specification when using pairs formed by counties from different commuting zones.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32901,32901,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024

Privacy Elasticity: A (Hopefully) Useful New Concept,"Inbal Dekel, Rachel Cummings, Ori Heffetz & Katrina Ligett","Privacy considerations and their effects on behavior are becoming increasingly important. Yet the extremes of full and no privacy are rarely an option. How much does behavior change with small changes in privacy? Dekel et al. (2023) introduce the concept of privacy elasticity, the responsiveness of economic variables to small changes in privacy protections. This concept combines elasticity—a key economic measure of responsiveness of one variable to changes in another—and differential privacy—a computer science theory emerging as the standard tool for protecting and quantifying privacy. Together, they create a measure of privacy elasticity that is portable and comparable across contexts. The applicability of this concept is demonstrated by reviewing how privacy elasticity can be estimated in a public-good lab experiment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32903,32903,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024
Equilibrium Evictions,"Dean Corbae, Andrew Glover & Michael Nattinger","We develop a simple equilibrium model of rental markets for housing in which eviction occurs endogenously. Both landlords and renters lack commitment; a landlord evicts a delinquent tenant if they do not expect total future rent payments to cover costs, while tenants cannot commit to paying more rent than they would be able or willing to pay given their outside option of searching for a new rental. Renters who are persistently delinquent are more likely to be evicted and pay more per quality-adjusted unit of housing than renters who are less likely to be delinquent. Evictions due to a tenant’s inability to pay are never socially efficient, and lead to lower quality investment in housing and too few vacancies relative to the socially optimal allocation. Government policies that restrict landlords’ ability to evict can improve welfare relative to laissez-faire, but a full moratorium on evictions only raises welfare when it is temporarily adopted in response to a large adverse shock. Finally, rent support can effectively eliminate evictions even without covering all missed rent and delivers significantly larger gains than eviction restrictions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32898,32898,24-Sep,NBER,9/9/2024

Diffusion of new technologies,"Nicholas Bloom Marcela Carvalho, Tarek Hassan, Aakash Kalyani, Josh Lerner, and Ahmed Tahoun","CORRECT ORDER OF AUTHORS: Aakash Kalyani, Nicholas Bloom, Marcela Carvalho, Tarek Hassan, Josh Lerner, and Ahmed Tahoun.

We identify phrases associated with novel technologies using textual analysis of patents, job postings, and earnings calls, enabling us to identify four stylized facts on the diffusion of jobs relating to new technologies. First, the development of new technologies is geographically highly concentrated, more so even than overall patenting: 56% of the economically most impactful technologies come from just two U.S. locations, Silicon Valley and the Northeast Corridor. Second, as the technologies mature and the number of related jobs grows, hiring spreads geographically. But this process is very slow, taking around 50 years to disperse fully. Third, while initial hiring in new technologies is highly skill biased, over time the mean skill level in new positions declines, drawing in an increasing number of lower-skilled workers. Finally, the geographic spread of hiring is slowest for higher-skilled positions, with the locations where new technologies were pioneered remaining the focus for the technology’s high-skill jobs for decades.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-009,2024-009B,24-Sep,FED-STLOUIS,9/10/2024

Do Price Deflators for High-Tech Goods Overstate Quality Change?,"Ana M. Aizcorbe, Daniel Ripperger-Suhler","This paper studies chained price indexes for goods in high-tech sectors, how they handle quality change and whether they will likely suffer from chain drift issues. We argue that chained indexes do not handle quality change properly; though the underlying bilateral indexes hold quality constant just fine, the chained index does not, a problem we call comingling. When we explored multilateral methods as alternatives to chained indexes, we found that the GEKS index that is often used to deal with the chain drift problem does not fix the comingling problem. Thus, the comingling issue is not just the chain drift problem in another guise; it can also exist in indexes that do not suffer from chain drift. Moreover, the practical implication of this finding is that we cannot use the GEKS index as benchmark against which to judge the numerical importance of these issues.Using the Weighted Time Product Dummy (WTPD) index as a benchmark, we show that, the changes in prices and expenditure shares over the product cycle that are typically exhibited by these high-tech goods can generate numerically important chain drift problems. Moreover, we show that the gap is negative: that is, the chained index will show faster price declines than the WTPD index. We illustrate these points using scanner data for six categories of consumer electronic goods.",https://www.bea.gov//research/papers/2024/do-price-deflators-high-tech-goods-overstate-quality-change,WP2024-5,9/10/2024,BEA,9/11/2024
Banking Law and Climate Change: Key Legal Issues,Mario Tamez ; Ender Emre ; Alessandro Gullo,"This paper explores the intersection of climate change policies with banking supervisory law. Statutory mandates define banking supervisory agencies’ objectives, functions and powers. Policies that aim to address climate change risks appear fully germane to banking supervisors’ main objective of safety and soundness. As such, banking supervisory agencies have a duty to address climate risks in light of their mandate. A mandate that is not anchored on safety and soundness in light of best practice would blur the accountability of banking supervisory agencies and undermine their legitimacy also with respect to climate. While legal changes can help provide greater legal certaintly, particularly given the long-term perspective of climate change, bank supervisory agencies can take action without fundamental reforms of their legal framework. Accordingly, they have set expectations or requirements for banks to incorporate climate into their strategy and business model, risk management, and governance. A combination of legal instruments—based on soft law and hard law—helps to achieve this objective. Notwithstanding implementation challenges, taxonomies and disclosures remain important tools, and banking supervisors should assess their role in the development of such tools in light of their mandate. The key responsibility to address climate risks rests on banks, and corporate governance frameworks could assist.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/09/10/Banking-Law-and-Climate-Change-Key-Legal-Issues-553514,2024-193,"Tue, 10 Sep 2024 ",IMF,9/11/2024

The government can provide transfers by raising tax revenue and has several tax instruments at its disposal: a flat capital income tax, a flat consumption tax, and a non-linear labor income tax. We compute the equilibrium and transitional dynamics for 3888 different tax combinations and find that the optimal fiscal policy funds a transfer that is above 60 percent of GDP through a combination of very high taxes on consumption and capital income. The labor tax schedule has a high average rate and more progressivity than the current US system.

"Energy price shocks, monetary policy and inequality","Alina Bobasu, Michael Dobrew, Amalia Repele","We study how monetary policy shapes the aggregate and distributional effects of an energy price shock. Based on the observed heterogeneity in consumption exposures to energy and household wealth, we build a quantitative small open-economy HANK model that matches salient features of the Euro Area data. Our model incorporates energy as both a consumption good for households with non-homothetic preferences as well as a factor input into production with input complementarities. Independently of policy energy price shocks always reduce aggregate consumption. Households with little wealth are more adversely affected through both a decline in labor income as well as negative direct price effects. Active policy responses raising rates in response to inflation amplifies aggregate outcomes through a reduction in aggregate demand, but speeds up the recovery by enabling households to rebuild wealth through higher returns on savings. However, low-wealth households are further adversely affected as they have little savings to rebuild wealth from and instead loose due to further declining labor income.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2967~f71901dc13.en.pdf?80231027d3565f81330210e749558334,2967,2-Aug-24,ECB,8/2/2024
The life-cycle dynamics of wealth mobility,"Richard Audoly, Gonzalo Paz-Pardo, Rory McGee, Sergio Ocampo","We use 25 years of tax records for the Norwegian population to study the mobility of wealth over people’s lifetimes. We find considerable wealth mobility over the life cycle. To understand the underlying mobility patterns, we group individuals with similar wealth rank histories using agglomerative hierarchical clustering, a tool from statistical learning. The mobility patterns we elicit provide evidence of segmented mobility. Over 60 percent of the population remains at the top or bottom of the wealth distribution throughout their lives. Mobility is driven by the remaining 40 percent, who move only within the middle of the distribution. Movements are tied to differential income trajectories and business activities across groups. We show parental wealth is the key predictor of who is persistently rich or poor, while human capital is the main predictor of those who rise and fall through the middle of the distribution.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2976~4088913b73.en.pdf?66d20082807a82af609396b3e16fc94c,2976,27-Aug-24,ECB,8/27/2024
Geopolitical risk shocks: when the size matters,"Davide Brignone, Luca Gambetti, Martino Ricci","In this paper, we investigate the presence of non-linearities in the transmission of geopolitical risk (GPR) shocks. Our methodology involves incorporating a non-linear function of the identified shock into a VARX model and examining its impulse response functions and historical decomposition. We find that the primary transmission channel of such shocks is associated with heightened uncertainty,which significantly escalates only with substantially large GPR shocks (i.e., above 4 standard deviations). This increase in uncertainty prompts precautionary saving behaviors, exerting a strong impact on consumption and reducing activity. The response of inflation is more subdued, reflecting both diminished demand and heightened uncertainty, which influence prices in opposing directions.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2972~6da32f928b.en.pdf?57d948e3514327a032ed967f0423c2dc,2972,7-Aug-24,ECB,8/7/2024

Reorganization reduces the negative effect of bankruptcy on employee earnings, even with most workers leaving reorganized firms. We examine plausible mechanisms and find evidence that the retention of general skills and improved job-match quality contribute meaningfully to this effect. The average cost of labor misallocation caused by reorganization is small.

"Reallocation, productivity, and monetary policy in an energy crisis","Andrea Colciago, Romanos Priftis, Boris Chafwehé","This paper introduces a New Keynesian multi-sector industry model that integrates firm heterogeneity, entry, and exit dynamics, while considering energy production from both fossil fuels and renewables. We investigate the effects of a sustained increase in fossil fuel prices on sectoral size, labor productivity, and inflation. A hike in the price of fossil resources results in higher energy prices. Due to ex-ante heterogeneity in energy intensity in production, the profitability of sectors is impacted asymmetrically.As production costs rise, less efficient firms leave the market, while new entrants must display higher idiosyncratic productivity. While this process enhances average labor productivity, it also results in a lasting decrease in the entry of new firms. A central bank with a strong anti-inflationary stance can circumvent the energy price increase and mitigate its inflationary effects by curbing rising production costs. This policy entails a higher impact cost in terms of output and lower average productivity, but leads to a faster recovery in business dynamism. Thus, our results suggest that monetary policy faces a trade-off between stabilizing aggregate activity and business dynamism.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2961~67a805bed0.en.pdf?1331e64244e15e1b46056a6d0970313a,2961,29-Jul-24,ECB,7/29/2024
The pass-through to inflation of gas price shocks,"Lucia López, Florens Odendahl, Susana Parrága, Edgar Silgado-Gómez","This paper uses a Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregressive (BSVAR) framework to estimate the pass-through of unexpected gas price supply shocks on HICP inflation in the euro area and its four largest economies. In comparison to oil price shocks, gas price shocks have approximately one-third smaller pass-through to headline inflation. Country-specific results indicate gas price increases matter more for German, Spanish and Italian inflation than for French inflation, hinging on the reliance on energy commodities in consumption, production, and different electricity prices regulation. Consistent with gas becoming a prominent energy commodity in the euro area, including time-variation through a time-varying parameter BVAR demonstrates a substantially larger impact of gas price shocks on HICP inflation in recent years. The empirical estimates are then rationalized using a New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (NK-DSGE) model augmented with energy. In the model, the elasticity of substitution between gas and non-energy inputs plays a critical role in explaining the inflationary effects of gas shocks. A decomposition of the recent inflation dynamics into the model structural shocks reveals a larger contribution of gas shocks compared to oil shocks.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2968~e514c92723.en.pdf?79d652acf8cd886f00410dc705925855,2968,5-Aug-24,ECB,8/5/2024
Macroeconomic modelling of CBDC: a critical review,"Ulrich Bindseil, Richard Senner","Over the last decades, macro-economists have renewed their efforts to reduce the gap between monetary macroeconomics and real-world central banking. This paper reviews how macroeconomics has since 2016 approached the possible introduction of retail central bank digital currencies (CBDC). A review of the literature reveals that macroeconomic models of CBDC often rely on CBDC design features and narratives which are no longer in line with the one of central banks actually working on CBDC. In particular, the literature often (i) does not take into account the nature of central banks’ CBDC issuance plans as a “conservative” reaction to profound technological and preferential shifts in the use of money as a means of payments, (ii) does not start from design features communicated by central banks, such as no-remuneration, quantity limits, access restrictions, and automated sweeping functionality linking CBDC wallets with commercial bank accounts; (iii) does not explain well enough the difference between CBDC and banknotes within their macro-economic models, apart from remuneration (which central banks actually do not foresee); and (iv) assume that CBDC will lead to a significant increase in the total holdings of central bank money in the economy, although (i) and (ii) make this unlikely.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2978~277df84e22.en.pdf?f06b2e0f91e396896f91e1cda8fbd8d9,2978,29-Aug-24,ECB,8/29/2024
The transmission of bank credit conditions to firms-evidence from linked surveys,"Annalisa Ferrando, Sarah Holton, Conor Parle","Using a novel dataset linking firm level data from the Survey on Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) and bank level data from the Bank Lending Survey (BLS), we explore how changes in credit standards pass through to firms at a granular level. We find that tighter credit standards decrease loan availability reported by firms, increase the likelihood they report access to finance as the worst problem and decrease their investment. After controlling for country-sector-time fixed effects that capture cyclical macroeconomic conditions, effects only remain for firms that need finance. Moreover, we find that a more diversified funding base insulates firms from the negative impacts of tighter credit standards on availability of bank loans and access to finance, although there is little evidence of such an effect forinvestment. Effects are asymmetric, with stronger impacts recorded for a tightening than an easing. Our results underscore the importance of demand conditions when interpreting the credit conditions and we thus propose a new indicator of demand adjusted credit standards at a euro area level, which can be used to analyse broader credit dynamics.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2975~70d0cf3466.en.pdf?6d1862492b3b6c1bd6fb7b6b849ec82c,2975,21-Aug-24,ECB,8/21/2024

"Macro uncertainty, unemployment risk, and consumption dynamics","Joonseok Oh, Anna Rogantini Picco","Households' income heterogeneity is important to explain consumption dynamics in response to aggregate macro uncertainty: an increase in uncertainty generates a consumption drop that is stronger for income poorer households. At the same time, labor markets are strongly responsive to macro uncertainty as the unemployment rate and the job separation rate rise, while the job finding rate falls. A heterogeneous agent New Keynesian model with search and matching frictions in the labor market can account for these empirical findings. The mechanism at play is a feedback loop between income poorer households who, being subject to higher unemployment risk, contract consumption more in response to heightened uncertainty, and firms that post fewer vacancies following a drop in demand.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2971~fdcdde6306.en.pdf?32fe2902705b62d28a4d0217f6574317,2971,7-Aug-24,ECB,8/7/2024

High public debt and low public investment worsen resilience across Member States. Many policymakers, institutions, and academics support establishing a central fiscal capacity (CFC) as a solution. Against this backdrop, we propose a framework to assess a CFC in the euro area, aimed at stabilizing the business cycle, promoting sovereign debt sustainability, and reducing procyclicality in public investment. Our two-region DSGE model with a permanent CFC allocates resources based on the relative output gap while earmarking funds for public investment and imposing fiscal adjustment requirements for the high-debt region.

The not-so-hidden risks of ‘hidden-to-maturity’ accounting: on depositor runs and bank resilience,"Zachary Feinstein, Grzegorz Hałaj, Andreas Søjmark","We build a balance sheet-based model to capture run risk, i.e., a reduced potential to raise capital from liquidity buffers under stress, driven by depositor scrutiny and further fuelled by fire sales in response to withdrawals. The setup is inspired by the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) meltdown in March 2023 and our model may serve as a supervisory analysis tool to monitor build-up of balance sheet vulnerabilities. Specifically, we analyze which characteristics of the balance sheet are critical in order for banking system regulators to adequately assess run risk and resilience. By bringing a time series of SVB’s balance sheet data to our model, we are able to demonstrate how changes in the funding and respective asset composition made SVB prone to run risk, as they were increasingly relying on heldto-maturity, aka hidden-to-maturity, accounting standards, masking revaluation losses in securities portfolios. Finally, we formulate a tractable optimisation problem to address the designation of heldto-maturity assets and quantify banks’ ability to hold these assets without resorting to remarking. By calibrating this to SVB’s balance sheet data, we shed light on the bank’s funding risk and impliedrisk tolerance in the years 2020–22 leading up to its collapse.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2970~c74e258801.en.pdf?e534b3fe59fe797f5d9651876faea6b8,2970,6-Aug-24,ECB,8/6/2024

Risk-related scenarios are used as inputs for the stress test model. Banks’ capital losses derived from a scenario based on a reference level of risk are used to set the structural requirement. Additional losses associated with the current risk scenario are used to set the cyclical requirement.

Beyond borders: how geopolitics is reshaping trade,"Costanza Bosone, Giovanni Stamato","Rising trade tensions, a spate of trade-inhibiting policy measures and a weakening of multilateral institutions have sparked a growing concern about the potential implications of global trade fragmentation. Yet, empirical evidence that geopolitical considerations are already materially affecting trade flows is scant. In this study, we quantify the impact of geopolitical tensions on trade of manufacturing goods over the period 2012-2022 in a structural gravity framework. To capture the influence of geopolitical tensions, we use a measure of geopolitical distance based on UN General Assembly voting. The econometric analysis offers robust evidence that geopolitical distance has become a trade friction and its impact has steadily increased over time. Our results suggest that a 10% increase in geopolitical distance, like the observed increase in the US-China distance since 2018, is associated with a reduction in trade by about 2%.

Inflation (de-)anchoring in the euro area,"Valentin Burban, Bruno De Backer, Andreea Liliana Vladu","This article measures the degree of potential de-anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area vis-à-vis the inflation objective of the European Central Bank (ECB). A no-arbitrage term structure model that allows for a time-varying long-term mean of inflation expectations, π∗t , is applied to inflation-linked swap (ILS) rates, while taking into account survey-basedinflation forecasts. Estimates of π∗t have been close to 2% since the mid-2000s, indicating that long-term inflation expectations have overall remained well anchored to the ECB’s inflation objective. As this objective is however related to the ""medium term"", expectations components of various forward ILS rates are extracted: they appear to have been broadlyanchored, with tentative signs of de-anchoring up to the two-year horizon.

We consider a broad set of macroprudential instruments, including broad and sectoral countercyclical capital requirements, LTV and LTI limits and assess their transmission channels as well as their effectiveness in mitigating rising broad and sectoral vulnerabilities. We find that sectoral instruments are most effective to increase bank resilience to sectoral risks, limiting spillover effects.

What shapes spillovers from monetary policy shocks in the United States to emerging market economies?,"Erik Andres Escayola, Peter McQuade, Christofer Schroeder, Marcel Tirpák","Monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve System in the US are widely recognised to have spillover effects on the rest of the world. In this paper, we focus on the asymmetric effects of US monetary policy shocks on macro-financial outcomes in emerging market economies (EMEs). We shed light on how domestic factors shape external monetary policy spillover effects using indicators on the macro-financial vulnerabilities and monetary policy stances of EMEs. We find that a surprise tightening of monetary policy in the US leads to an immediate tightening of financial conditions which leads to a decline in activity and prices in EMEs over one year. Importantly, these effects are amplified in periods of high vulnerabilities and attenuated when EMEs follow a prudent monetary policy stance.

The paper provides a didactic exposition of the changes in the model properties brought by the various expectation settings. Furthermore, we conduct illustrative scenarios around the macroeconomic shocks experienced over the recent years. The simulations notably suggest that moving from VAR-based to model-consistent expectations would limit the pandemic-induced macroeconomic volatility but would exacerbate the price pressures during the inflation surge period.

Banks charge higher interest rates to firms featuring greater carbon emissions, and lower rates to firms committing to lower emissions, controlling for their probability of default. Both effects are larger for banks committed to decarbonization. Consistently with the risk-taking channel of monetary policy, tighter policy induces banks to increase both credit risk premia and carbon emission premia, and reduce lending to high emission firms more than to low emission ones. While restrictive monetary policy increases the cost of credit and reduces lending to all firms, its contractionary effect is milder for firms with low emissions and those that commit to decarbonization.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2969~0f4c56a156.en.pdf?b6e005d7334de68ad976f24bd9ae5759,2969,6-Aug-24,ECB,8/6/2024

We argue that using proof-of-stake blockchain technology in DeFi leads to a novel limit to arbitrage, arising from the tension between arbitrageurs' privacy needs and blockchain transparency. Using a new dataset which distinguishes private and public transactions in Ethereum, we find that a 1% increase in private information advantage leads to a 1.4% increase in intermediaries' profit share.

The Increasing Cost of Buying American,"Matilde Bombardini, Andres Gonzalez-Lira, Bingjing Li & Chiara Motta","The latest resurgence in the U.S. of policies aimed at reducing imports and bolstering domestic production has included the expansion of Buy American provisions. While some of these are new and untested, in this paper we evaluate long-standing procurement limitations on the purchase of foreign products by the U.S. Federal Government. We use procurement micro-data to first map and measure the positive employment effects of government purchases. We then calibrate a quantitative trade model adapted to include features relevant to the Buy American Act: a government sector, policy barriers in final and intermediate goods, labor force participation, and external economies of scale. We show that current Buy American provisions on final goods purchase have created up to 100,000 jobs at a cost of between $111,500 and $137,700 per job. However, the recently announced tightening of the policy on the use of foreign inputs will create fewer jobs at a higher cost of $154,000 to $237,800 per job.

Work from Home and Disability Employment,"Nicholas Bloom, Gordon B. Dahl & Dan-Olof Rooth","There has been a dramatic rise in disability employment in the US since the pandemic, a pattern mirrored in other countries as well. A similar increase is not found for any other major gender, race, age or education demographic. At the same time, work from home has risen four-fold. This paper asks whether the two are causally related. Analyzing CPS and ACS microdata, we find the increase in disability employment is concentrated in occupations with high levels of working from home. Controlling for compositional changes and labor market tightness, we estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in work from home increases full-time employment by 1.1% for individuals with a physical disability. A back of the envelope calculation reveals that the post pandemic increase in working from home explains 80% of the rise in full-time employment. Wage data suggests that WFH increased the supply of workers with a disability, likely by reducing commuting costs and enabling better control of working conditions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32943,32943,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
"Do Higher Tipped Minimum Wages Reduce Race, Ethnic, or Gender Earnings Gaps for Restaurant Workers?",David Neumark & Emma Wohl,"One of the arguments increasingly made to support large minimum wage increases is that they decrease wage or earnings gaps for minorities or women (e.g., Derenoncourt and Montialoux, 2021). The argument is often made with particular reference to higher tipped minimum wages for restaurant workers, because of discrimination in tipping that is immune to equal pay policy requirements. Of course, even if higher tipped minimum wages reduce hourly pay differences between groups, increases in tipped minimum wages can reduce employment or hours among restaurant workers (Neumark and Yen, 2023), and these effects could differ by race and gender, so implications for hourly earnings do not necessarily extend to overall earnings. We estimate the impact of variation in tipped minimum wages – or, equivalently, tip credits – on earnings of restaurant workers (which ignores employment variation but incorporates hours variation). We find that tipped minimum wages raise hourly earnings of women, but not of Blacks or Hispanics. But tipped minimum wages generally do not raise weekly earnings for these groups (because of hours declines for women). In contrast, regular minimum wages boost hourly and weekly earnings of all three groups of restaurant workers, with the effects arising from non-tipped workers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32964,32964,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
"Cournot Competition, Informational Feedback, and Real Efficiency","Lin William Cong, Xiaohong Huang, Siguang Li & Jian Ni","We revisit the relationship between firm competition and real efficiency in a novel setting with informational feedback from financial markets. Although intensified competition can decrease market concentration in production, it reduces the value of proprietary information (e.g., market prospects) for speculators and discourages information production and price discovery in financial markets. Therefore, competition generates non-monotonic welfare effects through two competing channels: market concentration and information production. When information reflected in stock prices is sufficiently valuable for production decisions, competition can harm both consumer welfare and real efficiency. Our results are robust under cross-asset trading and learning and highlight the importance of considering the interaction between product market and financial market in antitrust policy, e.g., concerning the regulation of horizontal mergers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32944,32944,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Firm Productivity and Learning in the Digital Economy: Evidence from Cloud Computing,"James M. Brand, Mert Demirer, Connor Finucane & Avner A. Kreps","Computing technologies have become critical inputs to production in the modern firm. However, there is little large-scale evidence on how efficiently firms use these technologies. In this paper, we study firm productivity and learning in cloud computing by leveraging CPU utilization data from over one billion virtual machines used by nearly 100,000 firms. We find large and persistent heterogeneity in compute productivity both across and within firms, similar to canonical results in the literature. More productive firms respond better to demand fluctuations, show higher attentiveness to resource utilization, and use a wider variety of specialized machines. Notably, productivity is dynamic as firms learn to be more productive over time. New cloud adopters improve their productivity by 33% in their first year and reach the productivity level of experienced firms within four years. In our counterfactual calculations, we estimate that raising all firms to the 80th percentile of productivity would reduce aggregate electricity usage by 17%.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32938,32938,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
"Assessing Nonresponse Bias in Macro Indicators by Combining Para-, Administrative, and Survey Data","Ori Heffetz, Guy Lichtinger & Daniel B. Reeves","National surveys are crucial for estimating key economic aggregates, including the unemployment rate, labor force participation, and household expenditures. The accuracy of these indicators is increasingly under scrutiny due to declining response rates and the consequent risk of nonresponse bias. How can we assess nonresponse bias in these key economic aggregates?
Using two Israeli national surveys, we propose a novel approach. First, using often-available paradata such as number of contact attempts and nonresponse reason, we create respondent and nonrespondent subcategories. Second, using rarely-available merged administrative records, we identify, for each nonrespondent subcategory, which respondent subcategory appears to resemble it most. We find that nonrespondents are a heterogeneous group: some—e.g., those temporarily unavailable—share administrative-record demographic and outcome profiles with harder-to-reach respondents, while others—e.g., refusals and withdrawals—are more similar in the administrative data to easier-to-reach respondents. Third, assuming that these resemblances would extend to survey outcomes, we impute (always-available) survey-based aggregates to nonrespondents within each paradata-based subcategory.
We demonstrate that our method can help assess nonresponse bias in surveys lacking matched administrative records, using the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey as an example.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32935,32935,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Hidden Debt Revelations,"Sebastian Horn, David Mihalyi, Philipp Nickol & César Sosa-Padilla","How reliable are public debt statistics? This paper quantifies the magnitude, characteristics, and timing of hidden debt by tracking ex post data revisions across a comprehensive new database of more than 50 vintages of World Bank debt statistics. In a sample of debt data covering 146 countries and 53 years, the paper establishes three new stylized facts: (i) debt statistics are systematically under-reported; (ii) hidden debt accumulates in boom years and tends to be revealed in bad times, often during IMF programs and sovereign defaults; and (iii) in debt restructurings, higher hidden debt is associated with larger creditor losses. The novel data is used to numerically discipline a quantitative sovereign debt model with hidden debt accumulation and an endogenous monitoring decision that triggers revelations. Model simulations show that hidden debt has adverse effects on default risk, debt-carrying capacity and asset prices and is therefore welfare detrimental.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32947,32947,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
The Distributional Consequences of Trade: Evidence from the Grain Invasion,"Stephan Heblich, Stephen J. Redding & Yanos Zylberberg","We examine the distributional consequences of trade using the New World Grain Invasion that occurred in the second half of the 19th century. We use a newly-created dataset on population, employment by sector, property values, and poor law transfers for over 10,000 parishes in England and Wales from 1801–1901. In response to this trade shock, we show that locations with high wheat suitability experience population decline, rural-urban migration, structural transformation away from agriculture, increases in welfare transfers, and declines in property values, relative to locations with low wheat suitability. We develop a quantitative spatial model to evaluate the income distributional consequences of this trade shock. Undertaking counterfactuals for the Grain Invasion, we show that geography is an important dimension along which these income distributional consequences occur.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32958,32958,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Expected EPS × Trailing P/E,Itzhak Ben-David & Alex Chinco,"All of asset-pricing theory currently stems from one key assumption: price equals expected discounted payoff. And much of what we think we know about discount rates comes from studying a particular kind of expected payoff: the earnings forecasts in analyst reports. Researchers typically access these numbers through an easy-to-use database and never read the underlying documents. This is unfortunate because the text of each report contains an explicit description of how the analyst priced their own earnings forecast. We study a sample of 513 reports and find that most analysts use a trailing P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio not a discount rate. Instead of computing the present value of a company’s future earnings, they ask: “How would a firm with similar earnings have been priced last year?” Even if other investors do things differently, it does not make sense to put discount rates at the center of every asset-pricing model if market participants do not always use one. There are other options. Trailing twelve-month P/E ratios account for 91% of the variation in analysts’ price targets.We construct a new kind of asset-pricing model around this fact and show that it explains the market response to earnings surprises.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32942,32942,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
"The Resilience of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) Countries During ECB’s Monetary Cycles",Joshua Aizenman & Jamel Saadaoui,"We investigate the resilience of CESEE countries during ECB monetary cycles after the entrance of ten countries to the EU in 2004. Undeniably, these countries have experienced a ‘miracle’ growth during the 2000s decade. However, several obstacles appeared following the global financial crisis and the euro crisis. In many CESEE countries, the quality of institutions has stalled, or even worse, has known a deterioration. Our investigation examines how fundamental and institutional variables influence cross-country resilience regarding exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices, inflation, and growth during the subsequent monetary cycles.  Specifically, we focus on five ECB tightening and easing cycles observed during 2005-2023.  Cross-sectional regressions reveal that limiting inflation, active management of precautionary buffers of international reserves, current account surpluses, better financial development, and institution quality are important predictors of resilience in the next cycle. The panel regressions show that the US shadow rate strongly influences resilience during the ECB monetary cycles. Besides, various asymmetries are discovered for current account balances, international reserves, and fuel import shares during tightening cycles. Panel quantile regressions detect asymmetries along the distribution of the dependent variables for financial development,  central bank independence, and the inflation rate preceding the cycles. These findings may provide guidelines that are useful for returning to the trajectory observed before the euro crisis by identifying the main fundamental and institutional variables that enhance the resilience of CESEE.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32957,32957,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Patent Text and Long-Run Innovation Dynamics: The Critical Role of Model Selection,"Ina Ganguli, Jeffrey Lin, Vitaly Meursault & Nicholas F. Reynolds","As distorted maps may mislead, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models may misrepresent. How do we know which NLP model to trust? We provide comprehensive guidance for selecting and applying NLP representations of patent text. We develop novel validation tasks to evaluate several leading NLP models. These tasks assess how well candidate models align with both expert and non-expert judgments of patent similarity. State-of-the-art language models significantly outperform traditional approaches such as TF-IDF. Using our validated representations, we measure a secular decline in contemporaneous patent similarity: inventors are “spreading out” over an expanding knowledge frontier. This finding is corroborated by declining rates of multiple invention from newly-digitized historical patent interference records. In contrast, selecting another single representation without validating alternatives yields an ambiguous or even opposing trend. Thus, our framework addresses a fundamental challenge of selecting among different black-box NLP models that produce varying economic measurements. To facilitate future research, we plan to provide our validation task data and embeddings for all US patents from 1836–2023.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32934,32934,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Aid for Incumbents: The Electoral Consequences of COVID-19 Relief,"Jeffrey Clemens, Julia A. Payson & Stan Veuger","The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented levels of federal transfers to state governments. Did this funding increase benefit incumbent politicians electorally? Identifying the effect of revenue windfalls on voting is challenging because whatever conditions led to the influx of cash might also benefit or harm incumbents for other reasons. We develop an instrument that allows us to predict allocations to states based on variation in congressional representation. We find that incumbents in state-wide races in 2020, 2021, and 2022 performed significantly better in states that received more relief funding due to their overrepresentation in Congress. These results are robust across specifications and after adjusting for a variety of economic and political controls. We consistently find that the pandemic-period electoral advantage of incumbent politicians in states receiving more aid substantially exceeds the more modest advantage politicians in these states enjoyed before the pandemic. This paper contributes to our understanding of economic voting and the incumbency advantage during times of crisis as well as the downstream electoral consequences of both the COVID-19 pandemic and of unequal political representation at the federal level.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32962,32962,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
"Putting the ""Finance"" into ""Public Finance"": A Theory of Capital Gains Taxation","Mark A. Aguiar, Benjamin Moll & Florian Scheuer","Standard optimal capital tax theory abstracts from modeling asset prices, making it unsuitable for thinking about capital gains and wealth taxation. We study optimal redistributive taxation in an environment with asset price changes, adopting the modern finance view that asset prices fluctuate not only because of changing cash flows, but also due to other factors (“discount rates”). We show that the optimal tax base (i) generally differs from the case with constant asset prices, and (ii) depends on the sources of asset-price changes. Whenever asset prices fluctuate, and are not exclusively driven by cash flow changes, taxes must target realized trades and generally involve a combination of realization-based capital gains and dividend taxes. This result stands in contrast to the classic Haig-Simons comprehensive income tax concept, as well as recent proposals for wealth or accrual-based capital gains taxes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32951,32951,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
"Social Status, Economic Development and Female Labor Force (Non) Participation",Kaivan Munshi & Swapnil Singh,"This research provides a status-based explanation for the persistent increase in female labor force non-participation (FLFNP) that often accompanies economic development. This explanation is based on the idea that households or ethnic groups in developing economies can signal their wealth, and thereby increase their social status, by withdrawing their women from the labor force. If the value of social status or the willingness to bear the signaling cost is increasing with economic development, then this would explain the persistent increase in FLFNP. To provide empirical support for this argument, we utilize two independent sources of exogenous variation—across Indian districts in the cross-section and within districts over time—to establish that status considerations determine rural FLFNP. Our status-based model, which is used to derive the preceding tests, is able to match the increase in rural Indian FLFNP that motivates our analysis. Counterfactual simulations of the estimated model indicate that conventional policy prescriptions, such as a reduction in the cost of female education, could {\em raise} FLFNP by increasing potential household incomes and, hence, the willingness to compete for social status. The steep increase in female education in recent decades could paradoxically have increased FLFNP in India even further.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32946,32946,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Minimum Wages in the 21st Century,Arindrajit Dube & Attila S. Lindner,"This chapter surveys the literature on the impact of minimum wages on low-wage labor markets. We describe and critically review the empirical methods in the new minimum wage literature, particularly those leveraging quasi-experimental variation. We provide a quantitative overview of the most recent evidence on the employment and wage effects of the policy, while also exploring emerging research on its impact on other margins, including amenities, other inputs (such as capital and high-skilled workers), firm entry and exit, output prices and demand, profits, and productivity. This approach allows us to present a comprehensive picture of how minimum wage policies affect firms, workers, and labor markets. We also review the evidence on the policy’s impact on wage inequality and income distribution. Finally, we discuss how these effects can vary depending on the economic context and the level of a country’s development.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32878,32878,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
The New Digital Divide,"Mayana Pereira, Shane Greenstein, Raffaella Sadun, Prasanna Tambe, Lucia Ronchi Darre, Tammy Glazer, Allen Kim, Rahul Dodhia & Juan Lavista Ferres",We build and analyze new metrics of digital usage that leverage telemetry data collected by Microsoft during operating system updates across forty million Windows devices in U.S. households. These measures of US household digital usage are much more comprehensive than those made available through any existing commercial or government survey. We construct representations of devices in ZIP codes and find evidence of significant variation in usage reflecting an urban-rural divide. We also show the existence of substantial disparities in usage even within narrowly defined Metropolitan Statistical Areas. Income and education correlate with these observed differences. These effects are large and suggest digital literacy gaps that extend beyond the availability of essential IT infrastructure at the local level. These findings call for interventions beyond the traditional focus on infrastructure access and address usage and skills development.

Why Do Workers Dislike Inflation? Wage Erosion and Conflict Costs,"Joao Guerreiro, Jonathon Hazell, Chen Lian & Christina Patterson","How costly is inflation to workers? Answers to this question have focused on the path of real wages during inflationary periods. We argue that workers must take costly actions (“conflict”) to have nominal wages catch up with inflation, meaning there are welfare costs even if real wages do not fall as inflation rises. We study a menu-cost style model, where workers choose whether to engage in conflict with employers to secure a wage increase. We show that, following a rise in inflation, wage catchup resulting from more frequent conflict does not raise welfare. Instead, the impact of inflation on worker welfare is determined by what we term “wage erosion”—how inflation would lower real wages if workers' conflict decisions did not respond to inflation. As a result, measuring welfare using observed wage growth understates the costs of inflation. We conduct a survey showing that workers are willing to sacrifice 1.75% of their wages to avoid conflict. Calibrating the model to the survey data, the aggregate costs of inflation incorporating conflict more than double the costs of inflation via falling real wages alone.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32956,32956,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Optimal Financing of Government Purchases,Andrew B.

We show how a package of various taxes and government bonds can finance government purchases and support the same balanced growth path as in the planner's optimum. The optimal tax rate on capital income implements the planner's optimal (but incomplete) sharing of idiosyncratic depreciation risks, while respecting the private nature of these risks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32961,32961,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Patent Hunters,"Lauren Cohen, Umit Gurun, Katie Moon & Paula Suh","Analyzing millions of patents granted by the USPTO between 1976 and 2020, we find a pattern where specific patents only rise to prominence after considerable time has passed. Amongst these late-blooming influential patents, we show that there are key players (patent hunters) who consistently identify and develop them. Although initially overlooked, these late-blooming patents have significantly more influence on average than early-recognized patents and are associated with significantly more new product launches. Patent hunters, as early detectors and adopters of these late-blooming patents, are also associated with significant positive rents. Their adoption of these overlooked patents is associated with a 6.4% rise in sales growth (t = 3.02), a 2.2% increase in Tobin’s Q (t = 3.91), and a 2.2% increase in new product offerings (t = 2.97). We instrument for patent hunting, and find strong evidence that these benefits are causally due to patent hunting. The rents associated with patent hunting on average exceed those of the original patent creators themselves. Patents hunted are closer to the core technology of patent hunters, more peripheral to writers, and in less competitive spaces. Lastly, patent hunting appears to be a persistent firm characteristic and to have an inventor-level component.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32965,32965,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Perpetual Futures Pricing,"Damien Ackerer, Julien Hugonnier & Urban Jermann","Perpetual futures are contracts without expiration date in which the anchoring of the futures price to the spot price is ensured by periodic funding payments from long to short. We derive explicit expressions for the no-arbitrage price of various perpetual contracts, including linear, inverse, and quantos futures in both discrete and continuous-time. In particular, we show that the futures price is given by the risk-neutral expectation of the spot sampled at a random time that reflects the intensity of the price anchoring. Furthermore, we identify funding specifications that guarantee the coincidence of futures and spot prices, and show that for such specifications perpetual futures contracts can be replicated by dynamic trading in primitive securities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32936,32936,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Black Reparations and Child Well-Being: A Framework and Policy Considerations,"Lisa A. Gennetian, Christina M. Gibson-Davis & William Darity","We offer a child-centric framework for reparations with considerations for policy and implications for child descendants of enslaved African Americans. We apply economic theory of human capital integrated with the theories of bioecological developmental systems to illustrate the multilayered aspects of harm from the legacy of slavery and racism. Our curation of estimates shows that relative to white peers, black children bear more than double the risk in outcomes unfavorable to educational and economic prosperity from birth through young adulthood. We also find that enduring racial wealth differences are larger among households with children than without children, with the child household racial wealth gap in 2019 remaining comparable to that seen 60 years ago. Simulations suggest that a wealth transfer of $130,000 per child during early childhood reduces the black-white gap in high school graduation by 13 percentage points and increases college attendance by 26 percentage points. A review of existing U.S. reparations initiatives shows that few include direct financial transfers or other forms of investments specifically for black families or children. Based on a contemporary survey, we find that black parents with young children express support for reparations in the form of direct cash payments as well as other forms of financial assistance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32931,32931,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024

We study one such “leveraged payout” transaction, the dividend recapitalization (DR). As large, high-quality firms are selected for DRs, we identify causal effects using PE relationship bank CLO underwriting. DRs induced by cheap credit make firms riskier, with higher bankruptcy and failure rates, but also more IPOs and revenue growth. DRs increase deal returns but reduce wages, pre-existing loan prices, and fund returns (possibly reflecting moral hazard via new fundraising), pointing to negative implications for employees, pre-existing creditors, and investors.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32948,32948,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024

Hell with the Lid Off: Racial Segregation and Environmental Equity in America’s Most Polluted City,"H.

Utilizing newly digitized historical data on the spatial distribution of air pollution in what was likely America's most polluted city, we analyze how racial disparities in exposure to air pollution evolved during this period of heightening segregation. Our findings reveal that black residents experienced significantly higher levels of pollution compared to their white counterparts, and this disparity increased over time. We identify within-city moves as a critical factor exacerbating this inequity, with black movers facing increased pollution exposure. We also provide evidence of the capitalization of air pollution into housing markets.

The Impact of Early Childhood Parenting Interventions on Child Learning: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Kimberly Dadisman, Andre Nickow & Philip Oreopoulos","Parenting is widely considered to be among the most important influences on early childhood (EC) development. But to what extent and under what circumstances can EC parenting programs improve child learning outcomes? While substantial progress has been made toward addressing these questions in recent years, there have been few attempts to systematically synthesize the evidence thus far with a view toward scaling and policy implications. This paper works toward filling this gap through a systematic review including both a quantitative meta-analysis and a detailed narrative analysis of randomized evaluations that test the impacts of EC parenting programs on learning outcomes. We find that these programs generate substantial effects across a wide range of contexts, and that the largest impacts are associated with programs that are conducted in low- or middle-income countries and that use curricula focusing on cognitive stimulation. Group parenting programs tend to yield effect sizes that are, on average, comparable to home visiting programs, typically at substantially lower costs. Qualitative analysis of evaluations of scaled interventions reveals that administrative implementation barriers rather than program ineffectiveness likely represent the primary impediment to stronger impact.

Carbon VIX: Carbon Price Uncertainty and Decarbonization Investments,"Maximilian Fuchs, Johannes Stroebel & Julian Terstegge","We study the effects of carbon price uncertainty on firms' decisions to decarbonize their operations. We first use information on the pricing of options on emission allowances in the European Emissions Trading System to create the Carbon VIX, a  market-based high-frequency measure of carbon price uncertainty. Carbon price uncertainty is high, varies substantially over time, and experiences persistent shocks around major climate policy events. To explore the effects of carbon price uncertainty on expected aggregate decarbonization investments, we analyze its effect on the stock returns of firms that help other businesses decarbonize. To identify these ""carbon solution providers,"" we extract common types of decarbonization investments from a large survey of firms, and then identify companies that offer the associated goods and services. We find that the stock returns of these carbon solution providers vary positively with carbon prices, but negatively with carbon price uncertainty. The effect of increases in carbon price uncertainty on our proxy for expected decarbonization investments is economically large and of similar magnitude as the effect of declines in carbon prices. These findings support predictions from real options theory that firms may delay investments in decarbonization when faced with uncertainty about the future costs of emissions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32937,32937,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
"Voting Rules, Turnout, and Economic Policies","Enrico Cantoni, Vincent Pons & Jérôme Schäfer","In recent years, voter ID laws and convenience voting have generated heated partisan debates. To shed light on these policy issues, we survey the recent evidence on the institutional determinants and effects of voter turnout and broaden the perspective beyond the most debated rules. We begin by discussing the importance of electoral participation both for its consequences on policy choices and for democratic legitimacy. Building on a simple cost-benefit model of voting, we then review (quasi)-experimental work studying the effects of voting procedures and of other election rules. Voting procedures (which determine how people vote) primarily affect the cost of participation. The obstacles they create matter more when they occur ahead of the election, when the stakes are not salient (e.g., voter registration requirements), and less when parties mobilize voters against them and when alternative ways to vote exist (e.g., when people can choose whether to vote by mail or in person). Election rules upstream from the election (such as campaign finance laws) and downstream (such as the use of proportional representation vs. plurality rule to map vote choices into a set of election winners) mostly operate through benefits, for instance by affecting electoral competitiveness and the number of candidates. We conclude by highlighting questions for future research.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32941,32941,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Inflation Expectation and Cryptocurrency Investment,"Lin William Cong, Pulak Ghosh, Jiasun Li & Qihong Ruan","Using proprietary data from the predominant cryptocurrency exchange in India together with the country's Household Inflation Expectations Survey, we document a significantly positive association between inflation expectations and individual cryptocurrency purchases. Higher inflation expectations are also associated with more new investors in cryptocurrencies. We investigate investment heterogeneity in multiple dimensions, and find the effect to be concentrated in Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) trading. The results are robust after controlling for speculative demand captured by surveys of investors' expected cryptocurrency returns, and admit causal interpretations as confirmed using multiple instrumental variables. Our findings provide direct evidence that households already adopt cryptocurrencies for inflation hedging, which in turn rationalizes their high adoption in developing countries without a globally dominant currency.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32945,32945,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
The Effect of Inflation Uncertainty on Household Expectations and Spending,Olena Kostyshyna & Luba Petersen,"We use a new Canadian household survey to examine how inflation uncertainty influences inflation expectations and spending. Through randomized information interventions, we provide inflation statistics with or without second moments, creating variations in households' inflation uncertainty. All information types effectively lower inflation expectations and uncertainty. While communicating inflation uncertainty does not affect expectations or uncertainty levels, it increases the probability assigned to expected inflation near communicated ranges. Using Nielsen IQ Homescanner data, we find that higher inflation expectations and uncertainty reduce household spending on goods. Communicating inflation statistics with ranges increases spending by lowering expectations and reducing uncertainty.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32939,32939,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Lee Bounds With Multilayered Sample Selection,"Kory Kroft, Ismael Mourifié & Atom Vayalinkal","This paper investigates the causal effect of job training on wage rates in the presence of firm heterogeneity. When training affects worker sorting to firms, sample selection is no longer binary but is “multilayered”. This paper extends the canonical Heckman (1979) sample selection model - which assumes selection is binary - to a setting where it is multilayered, and shows that in this setting Lee bounds set identifies a total effect that combines a weighted-average of the causal effect of job training on wage rates across firms with a weighted-average of the contrast in wages between different firms for a fixed level of training. Thus, Lee bounds set identifies a policy-relevant estimand only when firms pay homogeneous wages and/or when job training does not affect worker sorting across firms. We derive sharp bounds for the causal effect of job training on wage rates at each firm which leverage information on firm-specific wages. We illustrate our partial identification approach with an empirical application to the Job Corps Study. Results show that while conventional Lee bounds are strictly positive, our within-firm bounds include 0 showing that canonical Lee bounds may be capturing a pure sorting effect of job training.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32952,32952,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024

Inevitably, data privacy issues arise in the context of record linkage. This article identifies two complementary aspects at the intersection of these two fields: (1) how to ensure privacy during record linkage and (2) how to mitigate privacy risks when releasing the analysis results after record linkage. We specifically discuss privacy-preserving record linkage, differentially private regression, and related topics.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32940,32940,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Climate Capitalists,"Niels Joachim Gormsen, Kilian Huber & Sangmin Simon Oh","Firms' perceived cost of green capital has decreased since the rise of sustainable investing. Green and brown firms perceived their cost of capital to be the same before 2016, but after the post-2016 surge in sustainable investing, green firms perceived their cost of capital to be on average 1 percentage point lower. This difference has widened as sustainable investing has intensified. Within some of the largest energy and utility firms, managers have started applying a lower cost of capital to greener divisions. The changes in the perceived cost of green capital incentivize cross-firm and within-firm reallocation of capital toward greener investments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32933,32933,Sep-24,NBER,9/16/2024
Tackling the volatility paradox: spillover persistence and systemic risk,Christian Kubitza,"Financial losses can have persistent effects on the financial system. This paper proposes an empirical measure for the duration of these effects, Spillover Persistence. I document that Spillover Persistence is strongly correlated with financial conditions; during banking crises, Spillover Persistence is higher, whereas in the run-up phase of stock market bubbles it is lower. Lower Spillover Persistence also associates with a more fragile system, e.g., a higher probability of future crises, consistent with the volatility paradox. The results emphasize the dynamics of loss spillovers as an important dimension of systemic risk and financial constraints as a key determinant of persistence.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2981~1ee9cdf8d2.en.pdf?cf75273907fcf3e70c420bc1039e6f8d,2981,13-Sep-24,ECB,9/17/2024
"Digital euro demand: design, individuals’ payment preferences and socioeconomic factors","Claudia Lambert, Chloe Larkou, Cosimo Pancaro, Antonella Pellicani, Meri Sintonen","By applying a structural demand model to unique consumer-level survey data from the euro area, we assess how different CBDC design options, combined with individual (revealed) preferences, influence the potential demand for a digital euro. Estimating the demand for a digital euro, we find that if it were unconstrained, it could range, in steady state, between 3-28% of household liquid assets or €0.12 - €1.11 trillion, depending on whether consumers would perceive the digital euro to be more cash-like or deposit-like. With an illustrative €3,000 holding limit per person, it could instead range between 2-9% or €0.10 -€0.38 trillion.

Estimating the full effect of a partially anticipated event: a market-based approach applied to the case of TLTROIII,"Benjamin Mosk, Danilo Vassallo","This paper presents an event-study methodology that combines market data and survey-based probabilities to infer the full effect of a policy decision, as seen through the lens of financial markets. The market reaction to an event’s outcome reflects its surprise or announcement effect, and generally not its full effect. However, under certain conditions, the unobserved full effect can be derived from the observed surprise effect. Most importantly, the ex-ante probabilities of different outcomes must be known. We apply this methodology to a real-world example: the European Central Bank’s announcement of its third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROIII). The introduction of TLTROIII was highly anticipated, and therefore partially priced in, as market participants feared a “cliff effect” with the preceding operations under TLTROII coming due. We estimate the announcement’s full effect, focusing on its impact on a set of asset prices, as compared to a baseline wherein TLTROIII would not have been introduced. The full market impact surpasses the surprise effect by a factor of fifteen. We also find that the announcement had a highly heterogeneous impact on euro area sovereign bond yields.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2982~c0b30e1c22.en.pdf?b6600fd112b211278483d40cdfc48a93,2982,16-Sep-24,ECB,9/17/2024
Deindustrialization and Industry Polarization,"Michael Sposi, Kei-Mu Yi and Jing Zhang","We add to recent evidence on deindustrialization and document a new pattern: increasing industry polarization over time. We assess whether these new features of structural change can be explained by a dynamic open economy model with two primary driving forces, sector-biased productivity growth and sectoral trade integration. We calibrate the model to the same countries used to document our patterns. We find that sector-biased productivity growth is important for deindustrialization by reducing the relative price of manufacturing to services, and sectoral trade integration is important for industry polarization through increased specialization. The interaction of these two driving forces is also essential as increased trade openness transmits global technological change to each country's relative prices, sectoral specialization and sectoral trade imbalances.",https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/international/wpapers/2024/0428.pdf,GI428,15-Mar-24,FED-DALLAS,3/15/2024

Hours Worked and Lifetime Earnings Inequality,"Alexander Bick, Adam Blandin, and Richard Rogerson","We document large differences in lifetime hours of work using data from the NLSY79 and argue that these differences are an important source of inequality in lifetime earnings. To establish this we develop and calibrate a rich heterogeneous agent model of labor supply and human capital accumulation that allows for heterogeneity in preferences for work, initial human capital and learning ability, as well as idiosyncratic shocks to human capital throughout the life-cycle. Our calibrated model implies that almost 20 percent of the variance in lifetime earnings is accounted for by differences in lifetime hours of work, with 90 percent of this effect due to heterogeneity in preferences. Higher lifetime hours contribute to lifetime earnings via two channels: a direct channel (more hours spent in production at given productivity) and a human capital channel (more hours spent investing in human capital, which increases future productivity). Between a third and a half of the effect of lifetime hours on lifetime earnings is due to the human capital channel. Our model implies that policies that limit long hours have important effects on both the mean and variance of lifetime earnings.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-024,2024-024A,Sep-24,FED-STLOUIS,9/17/2024
Bootstrapping out-of-sample predictability tests with real-time data,"Silvia Goncalves, Michael W.

In particular, we establish its first-order asymptotic validity for West-type (1996) tests of predictive ability in the presence of regular data revisions. This allows the user to conduct asymptotically valid inference without having to estimate the asymptotic variances derived in Clark and McCracken’s (2009) extension of West (1996) when data are subject to revision.

Mismatch Unemployment During COVID-19 and the Post-Pandemic Labor Shortages,"Serdar Birinci, Yusuf Mercan, and Kurt See","We examine the extent to which mismatch unemployment—employment losses relative to an efficient allocation where the planner can costlessly reallocate unemployed workers across sectors to maximize output—shaped labor market dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent recovery episode characterized by labor shortages. We find that, for the first time in our sample, mismatch unemployment turned negative at the onset of the pandemic. This result suggests that the efficient allocation of job seekers would involve reallocating workers toward longer-tenure and more-productive jobs, even at the expense of fewer hires. We show that sectoral differences in job separations were the main driver behind this result, while differences in vacancies caused positive mismatch unemployment during the recovery episode.

The Implications of Labor Market Heterogeneity on Unemployment Insurance Design,Serdar Birinci and Kurt See,"We digitize state-level and time-varying unemployment insurance (UI) laws on initial eligibility, payment amount, and payment duration and combine them with microdata on labor market outcomes to estimate UI eligibility, take-up, and replacement rates at the individual level. We document how levels of income and wealth affect unemployment risk, eligibility, take-up, and replacement rates both upon job loss and over the course of unemployment spells. We evaluate whether these empirical findings are important for shaping UI policy design using a general equilibrium incomplete markets model combined with a frictional labor market that matches our empirical findings. We show that a nested alternative model that fails to match these findings yields a substantially less generous optimal UI policy compared to the baseline model. Our empirical results are also relevant for researchers estimating the effects of UI policy changes on labor market outcomes.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-026,2024-026A,September 2024,FED-STLOUIS,09/20/2024

In the model, as in practice, homebuyers enjoy free house showings without having to pay their agents. A buyer's agent receives a 3% commission from the homeseller after the home is purchased.

Explaining Machine Learning by Bootstrapping Partial Marginal Effects and Shapley Values,"Thomas R. Cook, Zach D. Modig, Nathan M. Palmer","Machine learning and artificial intelligence are often described as ""black boxes."" Traditional linear regression is interpreted through its marginal relationships as captured by regression coefficients. We show that the same marginal relationship can be described rigorously for any machine learning model by calculating the slope of the partial dependence functions, which we call the partial marginal effect (PME). We prove that the PME of OLS is analytically equivalent to the OLS regression coefficient. Bootstrapping provides standard errors and confidence intervals around the point estimates of the PMEs. We apply the PME to a hedonic house pricing example and demonstrate that the PMEs of neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosting models reveal the non-linear relationships discovered by the machine learning models and allow direct comparison between those models and a traditional linear regression. Finally we extend PME to a Shapley value decomposition and explore how it can be used to further explain model outputs.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/explaining-machine-learning-by-bootstrapping-partial-marginal-effects-and-shapley-values.htm,2024-075,September 2024,FED-BOARD,09/21/2024
The Inflation Accelerator,"Andres Blanco, Corina Boar, Callum Jones, Virgiliu Midrigan","We develop a tractable sticky price model in which the fraction of price changes evolves endogenously over time and, consistent with the evidence, increases with inflation. Because we assume that firms sell multiple products and choose how many, but not which, prices to adjust in any given period, our model admits exact aggregation and reduces to a one-equation extension of the Calvo model. This additional equation determines the fraction of price changes. The model features a powerful inflation accelerator – a feedback loop between inflation and the fraction of price changes – which significantly increases the slope of the Phillips curve during periods of high inflation. Applied to the U.S. time series, our model predicts that the slope of the Phillips curve ranges from 0.02 in the 1990s to 0.12 in the 1970s and 1980s.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-inflation-accelerator.htm,2024-078,September 2024,FED-BOARD,09/21/2024

Nonlinear Effects of Loan-to-Value Constraints,C. Bora Durdu and Sergio Villalvazo,"This paper investigates the impact of loan-to-value (LtV) borrowing constraints in models with occasionally binding credit constraints. These constraints give rise to a Fisherian debt-deflation mechanism, where exogenous shocks can trigger cascading effects resulting in significant declines in consumption, asset prices, and borrowing reversals—characteristic of financial crises. However, recent literature challenges traditional view by suggesting that collateral constraints may not always exacerbate financial disturbances but could instead foster dynamics leading to multiple equilibria. Building on this discussion, the paper explores equilibrium asset pricing models with LtV collateral constraints, identifying critical thresholds that govern asset price dynamics, consumption patterns, and current account behaviors. Our analysis uncovers that when the LtV limit is close to zero, tighter constraints induce smaller drops in consumption during crises. Conversely, when the LtV limit is close to one, we observe that tighter constraints induce larger drops in consumption during crises. The nonlinear relationship between the LtV ratio and adverse effects on macroeconomic outcomes aligns with cross-country evidence regarding the relationship between the level of financial development and the severity of consumption declines during crises.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/nonlinear-effects-of-loan-to-value-constraints.htm,2024-081,September 2024,FED-BOARD,09/21/2024
Do Bill Shocks Induce Energy Efficiency Investments?,"Corey Lang, Kevin Nakolan, David S. Rapson and Reid Taylor",Inattention can lead to suboptimal investment in energy efficiency. We study whether electricity bill shocks draw attention to the benefits of home energy efficiency investments. Our novel identification strategy builds on the fact that prolonged extreme weather events (which raise electricity costs for many customers) fall within a single billing cycle for some customers but are split across cycles for others. We find that households exposed to average sized bill shocks are 22 percent more likely to invest in energy efficiency than households with normal bills. This result suggests that inattention is indeed a factor in residential energy decisions and utilities may be able to leverage bill shocks to promote efficiency investments.,https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2405.pdf,2405,"July 16, 2024",FED-DALLAS,09/21/2024

Desmond (2023) argues that aid to low-income Americans is captured by more powerful market actors. I contextualize this concern as about incidence and consider both policies for changing incidence (by changing outside options) and supplemental critiques focused on reducing deadweight loss as well as reapportioning surplus. Kearney (2023) argues that declining marriage means American children grow up in less-resourced families. I suggest this decline may reflect shortfalls in “soft” skills needed to make marriage efficient in an era when men are increasingly a source of family economic instability while women’s outside options improve. I consider policies to improve soft skills and policies supporting family economic stability, which could reduce spousal-skill requirements.

In 93% of our experiments, the elasticity of decisions to fundamentals decreases in participants’ cognitive uncertainty, our measure of the severity of information-processing constraints. Moreover, in decision problems with objective solutions, we observe elasticities that are universally smaller than is optimal.

Employing novel data on French immigration from other European regions from 1850 to 1930, we find that higher immigration to France translated into lower fertility in the region of origin after a few decades - both in cross-region regressions for various periods, and in a panel setting with region fixed effects. These results are robust to the inclusion of a variety of controls, and across multiple specifications. We also find that immigrants who themselves became French citizens achieved lower fertility, particularly those who moved to French regions with the lowest fertility levels. We interpret these findings in terms of cultural remittances, consistently with insights from a theoretical framework where migrants act as vectors of cultural diffusion, spreading new information, social norms and preferences pertaining to modern fertility to their regions of origin.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32990,32990,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
"Theodore Roosevelt, the Election of 1912, and the Founding of the Federal Reserve",Matthew S. Jaremski & David C. Wheelock,"The Federal Reserve Act was the outcome of compromises among competing economic and political interests. Numerous studies examine how the act came together but largely take the makeup of Congress and the Administration as given rather than considering the unique circumstances that led to that political distribution. This paper examines how the election of 1912 changed the makeup of Congress and increased the likelihood of central banking legislation and shaped the act. The decision of Theodore Roosevelt and other Progressives to run as third-party candidates split the Republican Party and enabled Democrats to capture the White House and Congress. We show that the election produced a less polarized Congress and that newly-elected members were more likely to vote for the act. Absent their interparty split, Republicans would likely have held the White House and Congress, and any legislation to establish a central bank almost certainly would have been quite different.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32987,32987,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
"Exchange Rates, Natural Rates, and the Price of Risk",Rohan Kekre & Moritz Lenel,"We study the source of exchange rate fluctuations using a general equilibrium model accommodating shocks in goods and financial markets. These shocks differ in their induced comovements between exchange rates, interest rates, and quantities. A calibration matching data from the U.S. and G10 currency countries implies that persistent shocks to relative demand, reflected in persistent interest rate differentials, account for 75% of the variance in the dollar/G10 exchange rate. Shocks to currency intermediation are important, however, in generating deviations from uncovered interest parity at high frequencies and explaining the dollar appreciation in crises.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32976,32976,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
Mining Chinese Historical Sources At Scale: A Machine Learning-Approach to Qing State Capacity,"Wolfgang Keller, Carol H. Shiue & Sen Yan","Primary historical sources are often by-passed for secondary sources due to high human costs of accessing and extracting primary information–especially in lower-resource settings. We propose a supervised machine-learning approach to the natural language processing of Chinese historical data. An application to identifying different forms of social unrest in the Veritable Records of the Qing Dynasty shows that approach cuts dramatically down the cost of using primary source data at the same time when it is free from human bias, reproducible, and flexible enough to address particular questions. External evidence on triggers of unrest also suggests that the computer-based approach is no less successful in identifying social unrest than human researchers are.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32982,32982,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
Do Investor Differences Impact Monetary Policy Spillovers to Emerging Markets?,"Ester Faia, Karen K. Lewis & Haonan Zhou","We re-examine monetary policy spillovers to Emerging Market Economies (EME) in the form of capital flow reversals, using sectoral-level securities holdings data for Euro Area investors. In response to a surprise monetary tightening, active investors such as investment funds re-balance their portfolios away from EME, while more passive, long term investors such as insurance funds and banks exhibit no significant reaction on average. For active investors, the reallocation out of EME appears stronger under synchronized monetary tightening between the Fed and the ECB. However, these investors may even inject more capital to EME securities when the monetary tightening surprises contain positive news about the Euro Area economy. Issuers' monetary-fiscal stability may explain the heterogeneous impact of these spillovers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32986,32986,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
The Economics of Recycling Heterogeneity,Don Fullerton & Thomas C. Kinnaman,"We summarize the economics of recycling municipal solid waste. OECD data suggest that aggregate recycling rates in member countries have plateaued in recent decades. United States recycling rates for some materials remain low, even after decades of learning and participation. Major new policies may be required to increase recycling rates. Aggregate recycling targets are common in the US and OECD but may no longer be effective. We discuss many sources of recycling heterogeneity often ignored. First, recyclable materials are very different from each other. Economies and natural environments differ across space, and technologies change over time. Recycling policies that ignore heterogeneity are likely not set appropriately. If policy costs are low enough to set a unique recycling policy for each material in each locality, then a surgical recycling strategy may better serve society. Specific recycling policies for automobile batteries differ greatly from policies for yard waste, because these two materials are different. A surgical recycling policy could extend this practice, so that rules for aluminum cans differ from plastic jugs or glass bottles. Reaching future recycling targets could be frustrated by ignoring these heterogeneities across materials, locations, and time.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32981,32981,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
Experimentally Validating Welfare Evaluation of School Vouchers,"Peter Arcidiacono, Karthik Muralidharan & John D. Singleton","We leverage a unique two-stage experiment that randomized access to private school vouchers across markets as well as students to estimate the revealed preference value of school choice. To do this, we estimate several choice models on data only from control markets before turning to the treatment data for model validation. This exercise reveals that a model where school choice is constrained by ability-to-pay achieves better out-of-sample fit but still underpredicts experimental take-up of the voucher offer. We then present evidence from treatment markets that: a) the voucher offer also induced search; and b) private schools used program surplus to incentivize enrollment. Further, we show that a unified model incorporating these features can explain both the control and treatment data patterns. Estimates from that model imply that a targeted voucher program would have a marginal value of public funds (MVPF) of at least 3.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32968,32968,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
"Moving to Opportunity, Together","Seema Jayachandran, Lea Nassal, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, Marie Paul, Heather Sarsons & Elin Sundberg","Many couples face a trade-off between advancing one spouse’s career or the other’s. We study this trade-off using administrative data from Germany and Sweden. We first conduct an event-study analysis of couples moving across commuting zones and find that relocation increases men’s earnings more than women’s, with strikingly similar patterns in Germany and Sweden. Using a sample of mass layoff events, we then find that couples in both countries are more likely to relocate in response to the man being laid off compared to the woman. We investigate whether these gendered patterns reflect men’s higher potential earnings or a gender norm that prioritizes men’s career advancement. We provide suggestive evidence of a gender norm using variation in norms within Germany. We then develop and estimate a model of household decision-making in which households can place more weight on the income earned by the man compared to the woman. In both countries, the estimated model can accurately reproduce the reduced-form results, including those not used to estimate the model. The results point to a role for gender norms in explaining the gender gap in the returns to joint moves.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32970,32970,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
Evaluating Policy Counterfactuals: A VAR-Plus Approach,"Tomás E. Caravello, Alisdair McKay & Christian K.

Perry Preschool at 50: What Lessons Should Be Drawn and Which Criticisms Ignored?,"Alison W. Baulos, Jorge Luis García & James J. Heckman","The Perry Preschool Project, the longest-running experimental study of an early childhood education program, demonstrates how such interventions can yield long-term personal, societal, and intergenerational benefits for disadvantaged populations. The evidence is clear: investments in high-quality early childhood education and parental engagement can deliver returns even 50 years later. The program’s findings remain scientifically robust, particularly when analyzed through rigorous small-sample inference methods. The program’s findings also contradict common criticisms of preschool, as, when measured correctly, treatment effects on IQ do not fadeout. This paper draws insights from both the original founders and recent empirical studies, emphasizing the critical role of parental involvement in early education. The authors advocate for a scientific agenda focused on understanding the mechanisms behind treatment effects, rather than replicating specific programs. The analysis also underscores the broader implications of early childhood interventions for social mobility and human capital formation. Analysts of early childhood education should recognize that although credentials and formal curricula contribute to successful programs, the true measure of quality lies in adult-child interactions, which play an essential role.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32972,32972,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
"""Despair"" and Death in the United States",Christopher J. Ruhm,"Increases in “deaths of despair” have been hypothesized to provide an important source of the adverse mortality experiences of some groups at the beginning of the 21st century. This study examines this possibility and uncovers the following primary findings. First, mental health deteriorated between 1993 and 2019 for all population subgroups examined. Second, these declines raised death rates and contributed to the adverse mortality trends experienced by prime-age non-Hispanic Whites and, to a lesser extent, Blacks from 1999-2019. However, worsening mental health is not the predominant explanation for them. Third, to extent these relationships support the general idea of “deaths of despair”, the specific causes comprising it should be both broader and different than previously recognized: still including drug mortality and possibly alcohol deaths but replacing suicides with fatalities from heart disease, lower respiratory causes, homicides, and conceivably cancer. Fourth, heterogeneity in the consequences of a given increase of poor mental health are generally more important than the sizes of the changes in poor mental health in explaining Black-White differences in the overall effects of mental health on mortality.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32978,32978,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024

The Selective Disclosure of Evidence: An Experiment,"Agata Farina, Guillaume Fréchette, Alessandro Ispano, Alessandro Lizzeri & Jacopo Perego","We conduct an experimental analysis of selective disclosure in communication. In our model, an informed sender aims to influence a receiver by disclosing verifiable evidence that is selected from a larger pool of available evidence. Our experimental design leverages the rich comparative statics predictions of this model, enabling a systematic test of the relative importance of evidence selection versus evidence concealment in communication. Our findings confirm the key qualitative predictions of the theory, suggesting that selection, rather than concealment, is often the dominant distortion in communication. We also identify deviations from the theory: A minority of senders overcommunicate relative to predictions, while some receivers partially neglect the selective nature of the evidence they observe.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32975,32975,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
Are We Adapting to Climate Change?,"Marshall Burke, Mustafa Zahid, Mariana C. M. Martins, Christopher W. Callahan, Richard Lee, Tumenkhusel Avirmed, Sam Heft-Neal, Mathew Kiang, Solomon M. Hsiang & David Lobell et al. (View all)","We study whether the sensitivity of economic, health, and livelihood outcomes to climate extremes has declined over the last half century, consistent with adaptation. Understanding whether such adaptation is already occurring is central to anticipating future climate damages, to calibrating the level of ambition needed for emissions mitigation efforts, and to understanding additional investments in adaptation that could be required to avoid additional damages. Using comprehensive panel data across diverse geographies and outcomes, including data on mortality, agricultural productivity, crime, conflict, economic output, and damages from flooding and tropical cyclones, we find limited systematic evidence of adaptation to date. Across 21 outcomes we study, six show a statistically significant declining sensitivity to a changing climate, five show an increasing sensitivity, and the remainder show no statistically significant change. Our results do not imply that specific documented adaptation efforts are ineffective or certain locations have not adapted, but instead that the net effects of existing actions have largely not been successful in meaningfully reducing climate impacts in aggregate. To avoid ongoing and future damages from warming, our results suggest a need to identify promising adaptation strategies and understand how they can be scaled.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32985,32985,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
Economic Policy Challenges for the Age of AI,Anton Korinek,"This paper examines the profound challenges that transformative advances in AI towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will pose for economists and economic policymakers. I examine how the Age of AI will revolutionize the basic structure of our economies by diminishing the role of labor, leading to unprecedented productivity gains but raising concerns about job disruption, income distribution, and the value of education and human capital. I explore what roles may remain for labor post-AGI, and which production factors will grow in importance. The paper then identifies eight key challenges for economic policy in the Age of AI: (1) inequality and income distribution, (2) education and skill development, (3) social and political stability, (4) macroeconomic policy, (5) antitrust and market regulation, (6) intellectual property, (7) environmental implications, and (8) global AI governance. It concludes by emphasizing how economists can contribute to a better understanding of these challenges.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32980,32980,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
"Health Inequality and Economic Disparities by Race, Ethnicity, and Gender","Nicolò Russo, Rory McGee, Mariacristina De Nardi, Margherita Borella & Ross Abram","We measure health inequality during middle and old age by race, ethnicity, and gender and evaluate the extent to which it can explain inequalities in other key economic outcomes using the Health and Retirement Study data set. Our main measure of health is frailty, which is the fraction of one's possible health deficits and is related to biological age. We find staggering health inequality: At age 55, Black men and women have the frailty, or biological age, of White men and women 13 and 20 years older, respectively, while Hispanic men and women exhibit frailty akin to White men and women 5 and 6 years older. The health deficits composing frailty reveal that most health deficits are more likely for Black and Hispanic people than for White people, with the notable exception of those requiring a diagnosis. Imputing medical diagnoses to Black and Hispanic people uncovers even larger health gaps, especially for Black men. Health inequality also emerges as a powerful determinant of economic inequality. If Black individuals at age 55 had the health of their White peers, the life expectancy gap between these two groups would halve, and the gap in disability duration would decrease by 40-70%. Other outcomes are similarly affected by health at age 55, indicating that targeted health interventions for minority groups before middle age could substantially reduce economic disparities in the quantity and quality of life.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32971,32971,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
Privacy Protection and Accuracy: What Do We Know? Do We Know Things?? Let's Find Out!,Evan S. Totty & Thor Watson,"Statistical agencies have a dual mandate to provide accurate data and protect the privacy and confidentiality of data subjects. These mandates are fundamentally at odds and therefore must be balanced: more accurate data reduces privacy, while privacy protections introduce error that reduces accuracy. Balancing accuracy and privacy requires, among other things, that we can quantify accuracy and privacy. Quantifying privacy has become easier thanks to differential privacy. Quantifying accuracy may sound easy by comparison, but there are many challenges to doing this effectively. In this paper, we first discuss some challenges associated with quantifying data accuracy. We then focus on an often-ignored challenge, which is the existence of survey error in the data being protected. We provide an overview of how privacy protection error relates to total survey error. We also summarize recent work that uses validation data to quantify the impact of privacy protection error relative to and conditional on other sources of survey error. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges for future work on data privacy and survey error.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32989,32989,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
On the Identifying Power of Generalized Monotonicity for Average Treatment Effects,"Yuehao Bai, Shunzhuang Huang, Sarah Moon, Azeem Shaikh & Edward J. Vytlacil","In the context of a binary outcome, treatment, and instrument, Balke and Pearl (1993, 1997) establish that the monotonicity condition of Imbens and Angrist (1994) has no identifying power beyond instrument exogeneity for average potential outcomes and average treatment effects in the sense that adding it to instrument exogeneity does not decrease the identified sets for those parameters whenever those restrictions are consistent with the distribution of the observable data. This paper shows that this phenomenon holds in a broader setting with a multi-valued outcome, treatment, and instrument, under an extension of the monotonicity condition that we refer to as generalized monotonicity. We further show that this phenomenon holds for any restriction on treatment response that is stronger than generalized monotonicity provided that these stronger restrictions do not restrict potential outcomes. Importantly, many models of potential treatments previously considered in the literature imply generalized monotonicity, including the types of monotonicity restrictions considered by Kline and Walters (2016), Kirkeboen et al. (2016), and Heckman and Pinto (2018), and the restriction that treatment selection is determined by particular classes of additive random utility models. We show through a series of examples that restrictions on potential treatments can provide identifying power beyond instrument exogeneity for average potential outcomes and average treatment effects when the restrictions imply that the generalized monotonicity condition is violated. In this way, our results shed light on the types of restrictions required for help in identifying average potential outcomes and average treatment effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32983,32983,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
Equity and Efficiency in Technology Adoption: Evidence from Digital Health,"Itzik Fadlon, Parag Agnihotri, Christopher Longhurst & Ming Tai-Seale","Digital technologies are bringing vast improvements to modern society but also carry the risk of perpetuating disparities if adopted at lower rates by underserved communities. We investigate the efficiency and equity aspects of technological advancement in digital health by studying an intervention of “remote patient monitoring” that enabled patients to transmit real-time clinical data for timely treatment. The program was deployed at the Academic Medical Center UC San Diego Health among a diverse population of patients and targeted hypertension management to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. From an efficiency standpoint, we find significant and persistent reductions in cardiovascular risk, which are notable across all subgroups of gender, age, race/ethnicity, and geographic affluence. Evidence suggests both reduced frictions in the provision of care and improved health behaviors as mechanisms. The program also led to significant reductions in healthcare utilization costs from improved hypertension control. From an equity standpoint, however, we find that the longer-run health gains from the program fell short among underserved patient subpopulations, inducing inequities in the reductions in cardiovascular risk. The new technology was systematically adopted at lower rates by Black/Hispanic patients and by patients from disadvantaged geographic communities, who were less likely to either take up or adhere to the program. Overall, our analysis highlights the simultaneous promise and hazards of digital health technologies. We further provide evidence that primary care physicians and the nature of their relationship with patients can have a promising role in promoting greater and more equitable adoption of digital health.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32992,32992,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
A Secure Query System to Improve Access to Individual Income Tax Data,"Amy O'Hara, Stephanie Straus, Ron Borzekowski, Paul Arnsberger & Barry Johnson","In recent years, important and headline-grabbing findings have emerged from research using individual income tax data for statistical purposes. Demand for these microdata, accessible under the tax administration authority of the Internal Revenue Code and through the IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) Division’s Joint Statistical Research Program, continues to grow. This paper describes a new approach to address demand from government agencies and nonprofit institutions for such statistics.
The project explores the feasibility of a privacy preserving secure query system (SQS) linking end-users of the data, a data intermediary, and SOI.  In the early stages of development, end-users may be state or local government agencies or nonprofit institutions (e.g., non-degree programs at community colleges); the intermediary is Georgetown University; and all processing will be done within and by SOI staff. The objective is for an SQS client, such as a state department of social services, to prepare and submit a dataset with personal identifiers for SOI to match to individual income tax records, in order to produce tables of predefined output statistics. This efficient and automated process should allow greater production of evidence at much lower cost and burden for clients and SOI.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32969,32969,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
Fiscal and Monetary Policy with Heterogeneous Agents,"Adrien Auclert, Matthew Rognlie & Ludwig Straub","In the past decade, a new paradigm for fiscal and monetary policy analysis has emerged, combining the canonical macro model of income and wealth inequality with the New Keynesian model. These Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian (“HANK”) models feature new transmission channels and allow for the joint study of aggregate and distributional effects. We review key developments in this literature through the lens of a unified “canonical HANK model”. Monetary and balanced-budget fiscal policy have similar aggregate effects as in the standard new Keynesian model, while deficit-financed fiscal policy is much more expansionary. We discuss the split between direct and indirect effects of policy, and also the implications of cyclical income risk, maturity structure, nominal assets, behavioral frictions, and many other extensions to the model. Throughout, we highlight the benefits of using sequence-space methods to solve and analyze this class of models.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32991,32991,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
Entry Costs Rise with Growth,Peter J. Klenow & Huiyu Li,"Over time and across states in the U.S., the number of firms is more closely tied to overall employment than to output per worker. In many models of firm dynamics, trade, and growth with a free entry condition, these facts imply that the costs of creating a new firm increase sharply with productivity growth. This increase in entry costs can stem from the rising cost of labor used in entry and weak or negative knowledge spillovers from prior entry. How entry costs vary with growth matters for welfare. For example, our findings suggest that productivity-enhancing policies will not induce entry of firms, thereby limiting the total impact of such policies on welfare.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32974,32974,September 2024,NBER,09/23/2024
The Nonbank Footprint of Banks,Nicola Cetorelli and Saketh Prazad,"U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs) have developed a very significant nonbank footprint over the years, adding thousands of specialty lenders, brokers and dealers, asset management, and insurance subsidiaries to their organizations. These nonbank subsidiaries represent a sizeable share of aggregate BHC assets and a significant component of the entire U.S. nonbank industry. We argue that liquidity management synergies are an important driver of the coexistence of commercial banks and nonbank subsidiaries within BHCs. Using unique data on BHC organizational structure and financial reports, we show that in the unrestricted pre-crisis regulatory environment, commercial banks within BHCs with a large nonbank footprint hold fewer liquid assets and more loans on their balance sheet. We show that our results are driven by explicit and implicit intracompany funding arrangements between affiliated banks and nonbanks. Post-GFC banking regulation, like resolution planning and liquidity regulation, has disrupted liquidity synergies and has caused BHCs to scale back their nonbank footprint.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1118,1118,2024-09-19,FED-NEWYORK,09/24/2024

Where Do Banks End and NBFIs Begin?,"Viral V. Acharya, Nicola Cetorelli, and Bruce Tuckman","In recent years, assets of nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) have grown significantly relative to those of banks. These two sectors are commonly viewed either as operating in parallel, performing different activities, or as substitutes, performing substantially similar activities, with banks inside and NBFIs outside the perimeter of banking regulation. We argue instead that NBFI and bank businesses and risks are so interwoven that they are better described as having transformed over time, rather than as having migrated from banks to NBFIs. These transformations are at least in part a response to regulation and are such that banks remain special as both routine and emergency liquidity providers to NBFIs. We support this perspective as follows: (i) the new and enhanced financial accounts data for the United States (“From Whom to Whom”) show that banks and NBFIs finance each other, with NBFIs especially dependent on banks; (ii) case studies and regulatory data show that banks remain exposed to credit and funding risks, which at first glance seem to have moved to NBFIs, and also to contingent liquidity risk from the provision of credit lines to NBFIs; and (iii) empirical work confirms bank-NBFI linkages through the correlation of their abnormal equity returns and market-based measures of systemic risk.

Marriage Market Sorting in the U.S.,"Anton Cheremukhin, Paulina Restrepo-Echavarria and Antonella Tutino","We examine shifts in the U.S. marriage market, assessing how online dating, demographic changes and evolving societal norms influence mate choice and broader sorting trends. Using a targeted search model, we analyze mate selection based on factors such as education, age, race, income and skill. Intriguingly, despite the rise of online dating, preferences, mate choice and overall sorting patterns showed negligible change from 2008 to 2021. However, a longer historical view from 1960 to 2020 reveals a trend toward preferences for similarity, particularly concerning income, education and skills. Our findings refute two out of three potential explanations – reduced search costs and growing spatial segregation – as potential causes of these long-term shifts. In particular, we conclude that people’s capacity to process and evaluate information hasn’t improved despite technological advancements. Among the remaining demographic factors, we identify enhanced workforce participation and college attainment among women as the primary drivers of the U.S. marriage market transformation. Furthermore, we find that the corresponding changes in mate preferences and increased assortativeness by skill and education over this timeframe account for about half of the increased income inequality among households.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2406.pdf,2406,"September 16, 2024",FED-DALLAS,09/24/2024

The runs were driven by large (institutional) depositors, rather than many small (retail) depositors. While the runs were related to weak fundamentals, we find evidence for the importance of coordination because run banks were disproportionately publicly traded and many banks with similarly bad fundamentals did not suffer a run.

Asymmetries in the transmission of monetary policy shocks over the business cycle: a Bayesian Quantile Factor Augmented VAR,Sofia Velasco,"This paper introduces a Bayesian Quantile Factor Augmented VAR (BQFAVAR) to examine the asymmetric effects of monetary policy throughout the business cycle. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the model effectively captures non-linearities in impulse responses. Analysis of aggregate responses to a contractionary monetary policy shock reveals that financial variables and industrial production exhibit more pronounced impacts during recessions compared to expansions, aligning with predictions from the ’financial accelerator’ propagation mechanism literature. Additionally, inflation displays a higher level of symmetry across economic conditions, consistent with households’ loss aversion in the context of reference-dependent preferences and central banks’ commitment to maintaining price stability. The examination of price rigidities at a granular level, employing sectoral prices and quantities, demonstrates that during recessions, the contractionary policy shock results in a more pronounced negative impact on quantities compared to expansions. This finding provides support for the notion of stronger downward than upward price rigidity, as suggested by ’menu-costs models’.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2983~ad23b7c8e2.en.pdf?9b6ec5b06090d7a8aeddedaad80d1b2d,2983,24 September 2024,ECB,09/24/2024

More than 24 percent of workers used it at least once in the week prior to being surveyed, and nearly one in nine used it every workday. Historical data on usage and mass-market product launches suggest that U.S. adoption of generative AI has been faster than adoption of the personal computer and the internet.

Households who deduct mortgage interest from their taxes face a lower post-tax mortgage rate, reducing the interest savings from refinancing net of taxes. We estimate the effect of the MID on refinancing using the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 as a natural experiment. The TCJA doubled the standard deduction, reducing MID uptake and value. We show that, following the TCJA, the refinancing rate amongst households who lose the MID increased by 25%.

Trade and Inequality in an Overlapping Generations Model with Capital Accumulation,"Jun Nie, B. Ravikumar, and Michael J. Sposi","We study the lifecycle aspect of within-country inequality that stems from capital and labor services supplied by individuals. Our environment is a combination of a multicountry trade model and an overlapping generations model with production and capital accumulation. Trade liberalization increases the measured total factor productivity in each country, which increases the marginal product of capital and incentivizes capital accumulation. Higher capital stock and higher measured productivity raise the marginal product of labor and, hence, wages. Inequality, measured by the ratio of old agents' income to young agents' income, evolves over time due to capital accumulation during the transition from autarky to an open-economy world. Immediately after liberalization, inequality increases.

The Contribution of Foreign Holdings of U.S. Treasury Securities to the U.S. Long-Term Interest Rate: An Empirical Investigation of the Impact of the Zero Lower Bound,Yixiang Zhang and Enrique Martínez García,"We find empirical evidence of a possible structural break in the relationship between the foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and the U.S. long-term interest rate occurring at the time when U.S. monetary policy became constrained at the zero-lower bound (ZLB). The estimated marginal effect of the foreign holdings ratio on the U.S. long-term interest rate, particularly its long-run effect, appears to have become stronger during the ZLB regime than it was before. We argue that the leading explanation of this apparent break is the nonlinearity introduced by the ZLB. Motivated by theory, we propose a flexible nonlinear specification to deal with the ZLB—a threshold single-equation error-correction model splitting the sample in two regimes, pre-ZLB and ZLB, which replaces the observed Fed Funds rate with a shadow Fed Funds rate derived from a Tobit-IV model to incorporate a broader measure of the stance of monetary policy. With this setup, we find no significant structural break in the relationship between foreign holdings and long-term rates at the ZLB. Therefore, we argue that the ZLB is a leading cause of the apparent shift in the empirical relationship. We also show that the estimated effects are not just statistically significant, but also economically significant. Through counterfactual analysis, we show that changes in China’s holdings of U.S. Treasury securities played an important role in explaining the 2004-2006 interest rate conundrum period and kept the long-term interest rate from going even lower in the recent ZLB period.",https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/international/wpapers/2024/0430.pdf,GI430,September 2024,FED-DALLAS,09/26/2024

Legacy settlement systems partition private information but are vulnerable to settlement fails. A token system with dynamic ownership representation, or a dynamic ledger, can be designed to achieve both, as long as it employs a protocol that enforces two restrictions: programs must be immediately implemented and must involve transactions based on verifiable claims.

Tokenization can improve efficiency in markets subject to a limited commitment problem. However, it also materially alters the information environment, which in turn aggravates a hold-up problem.

What the Transcripts Reveal About the FOMC’s Pre-Emptive Easing in July 1995,Kevin L. Kliesen,"At their September 2024 meeting, the FOMC began reducing the federal funds target rate and indicating the likelihood of additional reductions by the end of the year and into 2025. The FOMC took this action because of favorable inflation trends and some developing weakness in labor markets. A similar dynamic was at work from 1994 to early 1996. During this period, the FOMC undertook, first, a pre-emptive tightening in policy to combat emerging price pressures and then, second, a pre-emptive easing of monetary policy to counter the expectations of slower real GDP growth or outright recession. One key difference between the two episodes was the marked acceleration in inflation rate in 2021-2022 compared to 1994-95. Nevertheless, the end result of the 1994-96 episode was that the US economy avoided a recession and inflation by the end of 1997 was effectively at a level that is now deemed price stability. The purpose of this article is to outline the key arguments that Chairman Greenspan and the other FOMC participants deployed during the 1995-96 pre-emptive easing episode.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-029,2024-029A,September 2024,FED-STLOUIS,09/27/2024

Payout Restrictions and Bank Risk-Shifting,Fulvia Fringuellotti and Thomas Kroen,"What are the effects of payout restrictions on bank risk-shifting? To answer this question, we exploit the restriction policies imposed during the Covid-crisis on US banks as a natural experiment. Using a high-frequency differences-in-differences empirical strategy, we show that, when share buybacks are banned and dividends restricted, banks’ equity prices fall while their CDS spreads and bond yields decline. These results indicate that payout restrictions shift risk from debtholders into equityholders. Consistent with a risk-shifting channel, we find that these effects revert once restrictions are lifted. Moreover, banks that are ex-ante more reliant on share buybacks than dividends in their payout policies, decrease risk-taking relative to banks that are ex ante more dividends reliant, with those effects reverting when the restrictions are relaxed. These results indicate that payout and risk-taking choices are complementary and that regulatory payout restrictions endogenously affect bank risk-shifting incentives.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1123,1123,2024-09-28,FED-NEWYORK,09/28/2024

We find that in normal times, long-horizon disagreement is predominantly driven by individuals’ long-term beliefs, while short-horizon disagreement stems from private information. During economic downturns, heterogeneous reactions to public information become a key driver of disagreement at all horizons. When forecasters disagree about public information, monetary policy exhibits a delayed response and a price puzzle emerges, underscoring the importance of anchoring inflation expectations.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/disagreement-about-the-term-structure-of-inflation-expectations.htm,2024-084,September 2024,FED-BOARD,09/28/2024
Financial System Architecture and Technological Vulnerability,Selman Erol and Michael Junho Lee,"This paper presents a framework to study of technological resiliency of financial system architecture. Financial market infrastructures, or platforms, compete with services critical functions along various stages in the lifecycle of a trade, and make investments in technological resiliency to guard against attackers seeking to exploit system weaknesses. Platforms’ financial network effects attenuate competition between platforms on security. Exposure to vulnerabilities is magnified in the presence of strategic adversaries. Private provision of technological resiliency is generally sub-optimal, with over- and underinvestment in security depending on market structure. Vulnerabilities evolve over the maturity of a financial system, but there generically exists a tipping point at which technological resiliency diverges from optimal and creates technological drag on the financial system.

Estimating the Regional Welfare Impact of Tariff Changes: Application to the United States,Robert C. Feenstra & Chang Hong,"We propose an empirical method using a translog expenditure function to estimate the regional welfare impact of changes in import tariffs, and we apply this method to the United States. Tariff revenue is assumed to be distributed on a per-capita basis, so states with greater production will experience a welfare gain from tariffs on those products (due to rising producer surplus) while those with little production will lose (due to falling consumer surplus). Over 2002-17, we find that 28 states benefitted from reduced tariffs, with national welfare gains of $5.8 billion or $50 per household in 2017. These national gains were eliminated by the tariff increases after 2017, with national losses of $57 per household in 2019 and rising to $103 per household in 2022, but 25 states still gained. These estimates of the national losses from tariff increases are lower than found in other studies for the 2017-19 period, due to this study incorporating product exclusions that reduced the tariffs on certain products and also due to differences in the methods of calculation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33007,33007,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
Financial Advice and Investor Beliefs: Experimental Evidence on Active vs. Passive Strategies,Antoinette Schoar & Yang Sun,"Using a randomized controlled trial we test how retail investors assess and update their priors based on different types of financial advice, which either aligns with their priors or goes against it. We compare advice that emphasizes either the benefits of passive investment strategies (such as diversification and low fees) or active strategies (such as stock picking and market timing). We find that participants rate advice significantly higher when it aligns with their priors rather than contradicts them. But people update their beliefs about investment strategies in the direction of the advice they receive, independent of their priors. At the same time, there is significant heterogeneity based on the subjects’ financial literacy. Financially more literate subjects positively update in response to seeing passive advice, but most do not update (and rate the advice negatively) when exposed to active advice. In contrast, financially less literate subjects are strongly influenced by both types of advice. Finally, subjects rate the advice lower if the advisor is perceived to have misaligned incentives compared to when they are more aligned.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33001,33001,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
The Efficiency of Dynamic Electricity Prices,"Andrew J. Hinchberger, Mark R. Jacobsen, Christopher R. Knittel, James M.

Using data from all seven US wholesale markets and a new method to evaluate alternative rates set in advance that accounts for equilibrium price effects, we estimate efficiency gains from time-varying price schedules that better align price with cost. We have three main results. First, time-of-use rates and critical-peak pricing, the two most common time-varying rate plans, each correct about 10% of mispricing. Second, complex rate structures based on historical prices often backfire. Third, real-time pricing with price ceilings can capture most potential efficiency gains while limiting customer risk.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32995,32995,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024

Exchange rates can be expressed in terms of “equity net currency supplies”, i.e. local currency stock market capitalization minus equity holdings, denominated in investors’ currencies, as well as elasticities, reflecting the “centrality” of currencies in global equity markets. The observed components of our exchange rate decomposition account for, on average, 95% of the monthly variation of 28 bilateral currency crosses vis-à-vis the USD and 98% vis-à-vis the EUR.

A parent's enlistment in the Army increases their children’s military service propensity by between  58% and 110%. Intergenerational occupational transmission rates vary by race and sex---they are highest for demographic groups whose parents gained the most economically from service and for same-sex parent-child pairs. Our findings provide new evidence on the mechanisms driving intergenerational occupation correlations and show that intergenerational transmission is an important channel for getting under-represented groups into high-quality occupations.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w33009,33009,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
Nonparametric Estimation of Demand with Switching Costs: the Case of Habitual Brand Loyalty,"Xinyao Kong, Jean-Pierre H.

Auxiliary instruments and economically-motivated restrictions can tighten nonparametric bounds on the extent of brand loyalty in choice panel data. We also prove that the canonical dynamic discrete-choice model, nested in our nonparametric framework, has “built-in” exclusion restrictions that semiparametrically identify the discount factor, in general, and point identify it for standard parameterizations of switching costs. Case studies of several large consumer goods categories show that brand loyalty accounts for at least 10.8% but no more than 72.2% of the observed choices across categories studied. In some categories, it accounts for over 90% of observed repeat-purchase behavior.

Capital-Skill Complementarity in Firms and in the Aggregate Economy,"Giuseppe Berlingieri, Filippo Boeri, Danial Lashkari & Jonathan Vogel","We study capital-skill complementarity in a multi-sector framework featuring firm-specific, multi-factor production functions and allowing for firm-specific factor-price wedges. We characterize the elasticity of the skill premium to the price of capital equipment in terms of firm-level elasticities of substitution across factors, elasticities of substitution across firms and sectors, and factor intensities. Using French data, we provide credible identification of these firm-level elasticities. Combining these elements we offer the first identification of aggregate capital-skill complementarity that allows for arbitrary trends in the unobservable skill-bias of productivity at the firm, industry, and aggregate levels. We find an economically and statistically significant degree of aggregate capital-skill complementarity, but this force alone is insufficient to generate the full increase in the relative demand for high-skilled workers observed in the data. There is a substantial role for skill-augmenting technical change not embodied in capital equipment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33000,33000,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
"Social Interactions, Information, and Preferences for Schools: Experimental Evidence from Los Angeles",Christopher Campos,"This paper measures parents' beliefs about school and peer quality, how information about each affects school choices, and how social interactions mediate these effects. Parents underestimate school quality and overestimate peer quality. Cross-randomized school and peer quality information combined with a spillover design shows that when parents received information, they and their neighbors' preferences shifted toward higher value-added schools, underscoring stronger tastes for school quality and the role of social interactions. Increased enrollment in effective schools improved socio-emotional outcomes. The experimental evidence shows parents value school effectiveness even conditional on peer quality and that social interactions strongly influence school choice.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33010,33010,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
Cross-Border Shopping: Evidence and Welfare Implications for Switzerland,"Ariel Burstein, Sarah M. Lein & Jonathan Vogel","Consumers access foreign goods by purchasing them domestically or shopping abroad. We present new facts on cross-border shopping by Swiss households showing, for example, that prices of identical products are lower in neighboring countries, cross-border shopping shares fall with distance to the border, and price gaps and cross-border shopping shares rose following the 2015 Swiss Franc appreciation. We use a simple model of cross-border shopping to quantify how variation across space in cross-border shopping results in heterogeneous changes in cost-of-living in response to changes in international prices such as the 2015 Swiss Franc Appreciation and the 2020 Covid-19-related closing of the border.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33006,33006,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
APT or “AIPT”? The Surprising Dominance of Large Factor Models,"Antoine Didisheim, Shikun (Barry) Ke, Bryan T. Kelly & Semyon Malamud","We introduce artificial intelligence pricing theory (AIPT). In contrast with the APT’s foundational assumption of a low dimensional factor structure in returns, the AIPT conjectures that returns are driven by a large number of factors. We first verify this conjecture empirically and show that nonlinear models with an exorbitant number of factors (many more than the number of training observations or base assets) are far more successful in describing the out-of-sample behavior of asset returns than simpler standard models. We then theoretically characterize the behavior of large factor pricing models, from which we show that the AIPT’s “many factors” conjecture faithfully explains our empirical findings, while the APT’s “few factors” conjecture is contradicted by the data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33012,33012,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024

Child Penalties and Parental Role Models: Classroom Exposure Effects,"Henrik Kleven, Giulia Olivero & Eleonora Patacchini","This paper investigates whether the effects of children on the labor market outcomes of women relative to men — child penalties — are shaped by the work behavior of peers’ parents during adolescence. Leveraging quasi-random variation in the fraction of peers with working parents across cohorts within schools, we find that greater exposure to working mothers during adolescence substantially reduces the child penalty in employment later in life. Conversely, we find that greater exposure to working fathers increases the penalty. Our findings suggest that parental role models during adolescence are critical for shaping child-related gender gaps in the labor market.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33002,33002,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
Interdealer Price Dispersion and Intermediary Capacity,"Andrea L. Eisfeldt, Bernard Herskovic & Shuo Liu","Intermediation capacity varies across dealers, and as a result, misallocation of credit risk reduces the risk-bearing capacity of the dealer sector and increases effective market-level risk aversion. When the efficient reallocation of credit risk within the dealer sector is impaired, interdealer price dispersion increases. Empirically, when interdealer price dispersion increases, bond prices decrease. Interdealer price dispersion explains a substantial portion of bond yield spread changes, the cross-section of bond returns, and the changes in the basis between bond spread and fair-value spreads. We conclude interdealer frictions reduce the risk-bearing capacity of intermediaries and are crucial for intermediary bond pricing.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32998,32998,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
China: Autocracy 2.0,David Y. Yang,"Autocracy 2.0, exemplified by modern China, is economically robust, technologically advanced, globally engaged, and controlled through subtle and sophisticated methods. What defines China’s political economy, and what drives Autocracy 2.0? What is its future direction? I start by discussing two key challenges autocracies face: incentives and information. I then describe Autocracy 1.0’s reliance on fear and repression to address these issues. It makes no credible promises, using coercion for compliance, resulting in a low-information environment. Next, I introduce Autocracy 2.0, highlighting its significant shift in handling commitment and information challenges. China uses economic incentives to align interests with regime survival, fostering support. It employs advanced bureaucratic structures and technology to manage incentives and information, enabling success in a high-information environment. Finally, I explore Autocracy 3.0’s potential. In China, forces might revert to Autocracy 1.0, using technology for state control as growth slows but aspirations stay high. Globally, modern autocracies, led by China, are becoming major geopolitical forces, challenging the liberal democratic order.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32993,32993,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
Finance Without Exotic Risk,"Pedro Bordalo, Nicola Gennaioli, Rafael La Porta & Andrei Shleifer","We address the joint hypothesis problem in cross-sectional asset pricing by using measured analyst expectations of earnings growth. We construct a firm-level measure of Expectations Based Returns (EBRs) that uses analyst forecast errors and revisions and shuts down any cross-sectional differences in required returns. We obtain three results. First, variation in EBRs accounts for a large chunk of cross-sectional return spreads in value, investment, size, and momentum factors. Second, time variation in these spreads is predictable, and proxied by predictable time variation in EBRs. This result holds even controlling for scaled price variables, which may capture time varying required return differentials. Third, firm characteristics typically viewed as capturing risk predict disappointment of expectations (and of EBRs). Overall, return spreads typically attributed to exotic risk factors are explained by predictable movements in non-rational expectations of firms’ earnings growth.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33004,33004,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
The Unintended Consequences of Merit-based Teacher Selection: Evidence from Large-scale Reform in Colombia,"Matias Busso, Sebastián Montaño, Juan S. Muñoz-Morales & Nolan G. Pope","Teacher quality is a key factor in improving student academic achievement. As such, educational policymakers strive to design systems to hire the most effective teachers. This paper examines the effects of a national policy reform in Colombia that established a merit-based teacher-hiring system intended to enhance teacher quality and improve student learning. Implemented in 2005 for all public schools, the policy ties teacher-hiring decisions to candidates’ performance on an exam evaluating subject-specific knowledge and teaching aptitude. The implementation of the policy led to many experienced contract teachers being replaced by high exam-performing novice teachers. We find that though the policy sharply increased pre-college test scores of teachers, it also decreased the overall stock of teacher experience and led to sharp decreases in students’ exam performance and educational attainment. Using a difference-in-differences strategy to compare the outcomes of students from public and private schools over two decades, we show that the hiring reform decreased students’ performance on high school exit exams by 8 percent of a standard deviation, and reduced the likelihood that students enroll in and graduate from college by more than 10 percent. The results underscore that relying exclusively on specific ex ante measures of teacher quality to screen candidates, particularly at the expense of teacher experience, may unintentionally reduce students’ learning gains.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33008,33008,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
Welfare in the Volunteer’s Dilemma,Marco Battaglini & Thomas R. Palfrey,"We study the volunteer’s dilemma in environments with heterogeneous preferences and private information. We characterize the efficiency properties of equilibrium, which is a departure from all the previous literature that focuses only on the probability of group success. While the probability of success may be non-monotonic in the size of the group, we show that per-capita welfare is always increasing for all types, strictly for sufficiently high types. As group size increases, the expected utility of every type converges to the expected utility of the type with the lowest possible cost, which is the same expected utility when there is no free rider problem, i.e., when there is only a single player in the game and that player has the lowest possible cost.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32999,32999,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
Fear and Dreams: Understanding the Non-Institutional sources of Leader Strategy,"Maria Angélica Bautista, Juan Sebastián Galán, James A. Robinson, Rafael F. Torres & Ragnar Torvik","Political leaders make policy choices which are often hard to explain via institutions. We use the behavior of Colombian paramilitary groups as an environment to study non-institutional sources of variation in how public good provision and violence are combined to control populations. We hypothesize that a significant source of variation stems from the social preferences of the paramilitary commanders. Reciprocators adopt a strategy of offering public goods in exchange for support, but also use violence to punish those who do not reciprocate back. Reciprocity, developed via childhood socialization, is a characteristic of rural “peasants”. We develop a model which generates these hypotheses and test them using a unique dataset compiled from transitional justice documents.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33011,33011,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
Bridging the Gaps: The Impact of Interregional Transmission on Emissions and Reliability,"Audun Botterud, Christopher R. Knittel, John Parsons, Juan Ramon Senga & Drew Story","The substantial decline in the cost of wind and solar generation over recent decades has significantly altered the energy landscape. With these technologies becoming economically viable, even without stringent decarbonization policies, the role of interregional transmission has become increasingly important. This study examines the value of interregional transmission to the U.S. grid under current policies and deep decarbonization scenarios. By utilizing the GenX capacity expansion model, we evaluate the proposed BIG WIRES Act, which mandates a minimum interregional transfer capability requirement. Our analysis focuses on four key areas: interregional transmission builds and grid characteristics, electricity system cost savings, grid reliability during extreme weather events, and climate benefits. Results show that the Act can lead to a 68% increase in interregional transfer capability under current policies, resulting in annual system cost savings of $487 million and a 43.33 Mmt reduction in CO2 emissions. The benefits are even greater under a 95% CO2 reduction mandate. The study underscores the importance of interregional transmission in optimizing renewable energy use, enhancing grid reliability, and achieving cost savings and emissions reductions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32996,32996,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
Hours Worked and Lifetime Earnings Inequality,"Alexander Bick, Adam Blandin & Richard Rogerson","We document large differences in lifetime hours of work using data from the NLSY79 and argue that these differences are an important source of inequality in lifetime earnings. To establish this we develop and calibrate a rich heterogeneous agent model of labor supply and human capital accumulation that allows for heterogeneity in preferences for work, initial human capital and learning ability, as well as idiosyncratic shocks to human capital throughout the life-cycle. Our calibrated model implies that almost 20 percent of the variance in lifetime earnings is accounted for by differences in lifetime hours of work, with 90 percent of this effect due to heterogeneity in preferences. Higher lifetime hours contribute to lifetime earnings via two channels: a direct channel (more hours spent in production at given productivity) and a human capital channel (more hours spent investing in human capital, which increases future productivity). Between a third and a half of the effect of lifetime hours on lifetime earnings is due to the human capital channel. Our model implies that policies that limit long hours have important effects on both the mean and variance of lifetime earnings.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32997,32997,September 2024,NBER,09/30/2024
The Implications of Labor Market Heterogeneity on Unemployment Insurance Design,Serdar Birinci and Kurt See,"We digitize state-level and time-varying unemployment insurance (UI) laws on initial eligibility, payment amount, and payment duration and combine them with microdata on labor market outcomes to estimate UI eligibility, take-up, and replacement rates at the individual level. We document how levels of income and wealth affect unemployment risk, eligibility,
take-up, and replacement rates both upon job loss and over the course of unemployment spells. We evaluate whether these empirical findings are important for shaping UI policy design using a general equilibrium incomplete markets model combined with a frictional labor market that matches our empirical findings. We show that a nested alternative model that fails to match these findings yields a substantially less generous optimal UI policy compared to the baseline model. Our empirical results are also relevant for researchers estimating the effects of UI policy changes on labor market outcomes.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-026,2024-026B,September 2024,FED-STLOUIS,10/01/2024
How Demand for New Skills Affects Wage Inequality: The Case of Software Programmers,"Gustavo de Souza, Jack Mannion, Jacob S. Herbstman","We study how the demand for programming skills has impacted inequality. We create a new dataset with information on wages, employment, and software of Brazilian programmers, covering the period from the birth of information technology (IT) to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). High-ability, high-wage, and highly educated individuals in key technology hubs are more likely to become programmers. Creating software boosts both wages and career prospects of programmers, especially for those with specialized skills in AI and cybersecurity. These wage gains are concentrated among top programmers, increasing inequality within the profession. Therefore, increased demand for specialized skills in programming has contributed to wage inequality both within the programming field and between programmers and other occupations.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-19,2024-19,September 2024,FED-CHICAGO,10/01/2024

Using a comprehensive database of job ads posted by Norwegian employers, we develop a methodology to systematically classify the information on both pay and non-pay job attributes advertised in vacancy texts. We link this information to measures of employer attractiveness, which we derive from a job search model estimated on observed wages and worker mobility flows. About 55 percent of job ads provide information related to pay and nearly all ads feature information on non-pay attributes. We show that publicly advertised job attributes are meaningful predictors of employer attractiveness, and non-pay attributes are about as predictive as pay-related attributes. High-pay employers mention pay-related attributes more often, while high-amenity employers are more likely to advertise flexible working hours and contract duration.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1124,1124,2024-09-29,FED-NEWYORK,10/01/2024
"Inequality Within Countries is Falling: Underreporting Robust Estimates of World Poverty, Inequality, and the Global Distribution of Income","Maxim L. Pinkovskiy, Xavier Sala-i-Martin, Kasey Chatterji-Len, and William Nober","Household surveys suffer from persistent and growing underreporting. We propose a novel procedure to adjust reported survey incomes for underreporting by estimating a model of misreporting whose main parameter of interest is the elasticity of regional national accounts income to regional survey income, which is closely related to the elasticity of underreporting with respect to income. We find this elasticity to be substantial but roughly constant over time, implying a large but relatively constant correction to survey-derived inequality estimates. Underreporting of income by the bottom 50 percent of the world income distribution has become particularly important in recent decades. We reconfirm the findings of the literature that global poverty and inequality have declined dramatically between 1980 and 2019. Finally, we find that within-country inequality is falling on average and has been largely constant since the 1990s.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1125,1125,2024-09-30,FED-NEWYORK,10/01/2024
Nominal Maturity Mismatch and the Liquidity Cost of Inflation,Yu-Ting Chiang and Ezra Karger,"We document a liquidity channel through which unexpected inflation generates substantial welfare losses. Household balance sheets are nominal maturity mismatched: nominal liabilities have a longer duration than nominal assets. Due to this mismatch, losses from unexpected inflation are concentrated over short time horizons, while gains are spread out over the longer run. This has negative effects on liquidity-constrained households, who cannot easily borrow against their future gains. We quantify the importance of the liquidity channel and show that, for households in the lower half of the wealth distribution, the recent 2021–2022 unexpected inflation shock caused welfare losses valued at 0.5% of lifetime wealth: a monetary loss equal in size to 15% of current- year consumption. More than 75% of that loss is due to the liquidity channel, with the remainder coming from the more commonly studied wealth channel.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-031,2024-031A,September 2024,FED-STLOUIS,10/01/2024

"More Trade, Less Diffusion: Technology Transfers and the Dynamic Effects of Import Liberalization","Gustavo de Souza, Ruben Gaetani, Martí Mestieri","How does international trade affect technology diffusion? We show that tariff increases in Brazil lead to more international technology transfers to Brazilian firms and more citations to foreign patents. The highest increase in citations occurs among firms located near those receiving technology transfers, and it is driven largely by citations to firms transferring technology to Brazil. These findings suggest that import tariffs can facilitate the diffusion of foreign technology by promoting technology transfers. We quantify this effect in a growth model that incorporates trade, technology transfers, and their effect on diffusion. When tariffs in Brazil rise, foreign firms transfer their technology rather than export their products, boosting the diffusion of foreign knowledge. An optimal subsidy to technology transfers significantly amplifies the welfare gains from trade liberalization.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-20,2024-20,September 2024,FED-CHICAGO,10/01/2024

The inflationary consequences of prioritising central bank profits,"Stefan  Gebauer, Sebastiaan Pool, Julian Schumacher","This paper examines the impact of rising interest rates on central bank profitability. Using a stylized income model, we demonstrate that changes in interest rates in combination with expansive balance sheet policies introduce a cyclical component into the central bank’s profit and loss statement. Ourfindings reveal, however, that while the interplay of such policies may dampen short-term profitability if interest rates rise, they do not undermine a central bank’s financial strength, because higher interest rates also raise the value of future seigniorage income. Using data for the euro area, we quantify the consequences for inflation of setting interest rates aimed at mitigating financial losses, showing that such a strategy would lead to substantially higher inflation rates. Overall, our findings confirm that a central bank’s willingness to accept temporary losses reflects a commitment to price stability, rather than a hindrance.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2985~9a635ec5db.en.pdf?da9f9ca745bb4cd652d9e1ebf49a0d74,2985,1 October 2024,ECB,10/02/2024

Need for Speed: Quality of Innovations and the Allocation of Inventors,Santiago Caicedo and Jeremy Pearce,"This paper studies how the speed-quality tradeoff in innovation interacts with firm dynamics, concentration, and economic growth. Empirically, we document long-run trends in the increasing speed of innovation alongside declining quality at large firms. Leveraging variation from an exogenous policy change, we document the existence of the speed-quality tradeoff both at the firm and aggregate level. We develop an endogenous growth model that incorporates the speed-quality tradeoff and show that allocating less labor towards speed increases growth, particularly in the presence of private benefits to innovation and spillovers from heterogeneous innovations. We quantify the model to link firms’ decisions across speed and quality to aggregate outcomes. Quantitatively, the recent growth slowdown is mainly due to changes in the innovation production function, while the allocation of inventors between speed and quality within firms has a modest impact. When spillovers across firms are taken into account, the effect becomes significantly larger; the shift to speed over the last 30 years explains up to one-quarter of the decrease in growth.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1127,1127,2024-10-03,FED-NEWYORK,10/04/2024
Do Cost-of-Living Shocks Pass Through to Wages?,"Justin Bloesch, Seung Joo Lee, and Jacob P. Weber","We develop a novel, tractable New Keynesian model where firms post wages and workers search on the job, motivated by microeconomic evidence on wage setting. Because firms set wages to avoid costly turnover, the rate that workers quit their jobs features prominently in the model’s wage Phillips curve, matching U.S. empirical evidence. We then examine the response of wages to cost-of-living shocks, i.e., shocks that raise the price of household’s consumption goods but do not affect the marginal product of labor. Such shocks pass through to wages only to the extent that higher cost of living improves workers’ outside options, such as competing jobs or unemployment, relative to their current job. However, higher cost of living lowers real wages at all jobs evenly, and unemployment is rarely a credible outside option. We conclude that wage posting and on-the-job search limit the scope for pass-through from prices to wages.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1126,1126,2024-10-02,FED-NEWYORK,10/04/2024

After each question, the prior is updated, and the posterior is used to select the next, informationally-optimal, question. Simulations show that DOSE produces parameter estimates that are approximately twice as accurate as those from established elicitation methods. DOSE estimates of individual-level risk and time preferences are also more accurate, more stable over time, and faster to administer in a large representative, incentivized survey of the U.S. population (N = 2,000). By reducing measurement error, DOSE identifies a stronger relationship between risk aversion and cognitive ability than other elicitation techniques. DOSE thus provides a flexible procedure that facilitates the collection of incentivized preference measures in the field.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33013,33013,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
On the Optimal Allocation of Policy-Making,"Alessandro Dovis, Rishabh Kirpalani & Guillaume M. Sublet","How should society allocate policy-making between the legislative and the executive branches of government? We analyze a model in which biased and polarized policymakers set policy in response to shocks. We show that policy issues for which the policy-maker bias is small relative to the degree of polarization should be delegated to the legislature, while policy issues where the bias is large should be delegated to the executive. Moreover, when executive delegation is preferred, it is optimal to leave little discretion and impose a narrow mandate. This finding contrasts with conventional wisdom that executive delegation allows for greater flexibility. The main difference between the two institutional settings is the ability to restrict ex post bargaining under executive delegation. Thus, when the bias is large, executive delegation is preferred because it can effectively constrain policymakers' choices. In contrast, when the bias is small, the ability to bargain ex post allows for flexible responses to severe shocks while limiting political risk. We also study the credibility of these institutions and show that while delegating to the legislature is typically credible, executive delegation is typically not when the bias is exogenous but can be when the bias arises from time inconsistency problems.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33034,33034,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
Old and Connected versus Young and Creative: Networks and the Diffusion of New Scientific Ideas,Wei Cheng & Bruce A. Weinberg,"The adoption of new ideas is critical for realizing their full potential and for advancing the knowledge frontier but it involves analyzing innovators, potential adopters, and the networks that connect them. This paper applies natural language processing, network analysis, and a novel fixed effects strategy to study how the aging of the biomedical research workforce affects idea adoption. We show that the relationship between adoption and innovator career age varies with network distance. Specifically, at short distances, young innovators’ ideas are adopted the most, while at greater network distances, mid-career innovators’ ideas have the highest adoption. The main reason for this contrast is that young innovators are close to young potential adopters who are more open to new ideas, but mid-career innovators are more central in networks. Overall adoption is hump-shaped in the career age of innovators. Simulations show that the aging of innovators and of potential adopters have comparable effects on the adoption of important new ideas.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33030,33030,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
The Economic Impacts of Clean Power,Costas Arkolakis & Conor Walsh,"In this paper we assess the economic impacts of moving to a renewable-dominated grid in the US. We use projections of capital costs to develop price bounds on future wholesale power prices at the local geographic level. We then use a class of spatial general equilibrium models to estimate the effect on wages and output of prices falling below these bounds in the medium term. Power prices fall anywhere between 20% and 80%, depending on local solar resources, leading to an aggregate real wage gain of 2-3%. Over the longer term, we show how moving to clean power represents a qualitative change in the aggregate growth process, alleviating the “resource drag” that has slowed recent productivity growth in the US.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33028,33028,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
Is Distance from Innovation a Barrier to the Adoption of Artificial Intelligence?,"Jennifer Hunt, Iain M. Cockburn & James Bessen","Using our own data on Artificial Intelligence publications merged with Burning Glass vacancy data for 2007-2019, we investigate whether online vacancies for jobs requiring AI skills grow more slowly in U.S. locations farther from pre-2007 AI innovation hotspots. We find that a commuting zone which is an additional 200km (125 miles) from the closest AI hotspot has 17% lower growth in AI jobs' share of vacancies. This is driven by distance from AI papers rather than AI patents. Distance reduces growth in AI research jobs as well as in jobs adapting AI to new industries, as evidenced by strong effects for computer and mathematical researchers, developers of software applications, and the finance and insurance industry. 20% of the effect is explained by the presence of state borders between some commuting zones and their closest hotspot. This could reflect state borders impeding migration and thus flows of tacit knowledge. Distance does not capture difficulty of in-person or remote collaboration nor knowledge and personnel flows within multi-establishment firms hiring in computer occupations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33022,33022,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
The Effects of “Buy American”: Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act,"Hunt Allcott, Reigner Kane, Maximilian S. Maydanchik, Joseph S. Shapiro & Felix Tintelnot","We study electric vehicle (EV) tax credits in the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the largest climate policy in US history, with three goals. First, we provide the first ex-post microeconomic welfare analysis of this central component of the IRA. Event studies around changes in eligibility for EV tax credits find that short-run economic incidence falls largely on consumers. Additionally, domestic content restrictions on tax credits for purchased vehicles have driven enormous shifts to leasing. Our equilibrium model shows that compared to pre-IRA policy, IRA EV credits generated $1.87 of US benefits per dollar spent in 2023, at taxpayer cost of $32,000 per additional EV sold. Compared to scenarios with no EV credits, however, the IRA EV credits created only $1.02 of benefits per dollar of government spending. Second, we characterize the gains from policies targeting heterogeneity in externalities across vehicles. We find that relative to uniform credits, differentiating credits across EVs according to their heterogeneous externalities would substantially increase policy benefits. Third, we quantify tradeoffs in the IRA EV credits between foreign and domestic welfare and between trade and the environment. We find that the IRA EV credits benefit the environment but undermine trade, since they decrease global carbon emissions but use profit shifting to decrease foreign producer surplus. A controversial IRA loophole that removes domestic content restrictions on tax credits for EV leases has negative domestic benefits.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33032,33032,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
Do Workers Undervalue COVID-19 Risk? Evidence from Wages and Death Certificate Data,"Cong T. Gian, Sumedha Gupta, Kosali I. Simon, Ryan Sullivan & Coady Wing","When mortality risks of a job increase, economic theory predicts that wages will rise to compensate workers. COVID-19 became a new source of mortality risk from close contact with other workers and customers. Real wages have risen during the COVID-19 era, but research to date has been sparse on how much of this increase reflects compensating wage differentials for COVID-19 risk on the job. We use 2020- 2021 death certificate data which for the first time includes the decedent’s occupation and industry, together with other occupational and industry mortality for previous years from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) and wage data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to examine whether compensating wage differentials for COVID-19 occupational risks are in line with prior estimates of Values of Statistical Life (VSL). First, we find that there are substantial differences in the compensating differentials associated with COVID-19 vs other sources of job-related mortality risk. Full time workers’ pay is higher by $24 per week in jobs with a 1 in 1,000 higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, but their pay is $320 higher in jobs with 1 in 1,000 higher risk of non-COVID-19 workplace mortality. The non-COVID-19 mortality wage premiums imply that workers trade off money and mortality risk using a VSL of about $18 million, which is near the upper range of the most cited VSL estimates in the literature. In contrast, the COVID-19 wage premium implies that workers make decisions using a VSL of the range $1.24 - $1.54 million, much lower than standard VSL measures. The results are consistent with workers substantially underestimating or undervaluing the risk of COVID-19 mortality.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33031,33031,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
"A Flexible, Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Difference-in-Differences Estimator for Repeated Cross-Sections","Partha Deb, Edward C. Norton, Jeffrey M. Wooldridge & Jeffrey E. Zabel","This paper proposes a method to estimate treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs in which the treatment start is staggered over time and treatment effects are heterogeneous by group, time, and covariates, and when the data are repeated cross-sections. We show that a linear-in-parameters regression specification with a sufficiently flexible functional form consisting of group-by-time treatment effects, two-way fixed effects, and interaction terms yields consistent estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects under general conditions. The estimates are efficient and aggregation of treatment effects and inference are straightforward. We call it FLEX, because it is a flexible linear model estimated by OLS with covariates (X). We illustrate the use of FLEX with two empirical examples and provide comparisons to other recently derived estimators.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33026,33026,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
Trading Volume Alpha,"Ruslan Goyenko, Bryan T. Kelly, Tobias J. Moskowitz, Yinan Su & Chao Zhang","Portfolio optimization focuses on risk and return prediction, yet implementation costs critically matter. Predicting trading costs is challenging because costs depend on trade size and trader identity, thus impeding a generic solution. We focus on a component of trading costs that applies universally – trading volume. Individual stock trading volume is highly predictable, especially with machine learning. We model the economic benefits of predicting volume through a portfolio framework that trades off tracking error versus net-of-cost performance – translating volume prediction into net-of-cost alpha. The economic benefits of predicting individual stock volume are as large as those from stock return predictability.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33037,33037,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
Parents' Earnings and the Returns to Universal Pre-Kindergarten,"John Eric Humphries, Christopher Neilson, Xiaoyang Ye & Seth D. Zimmerman","This paper asks whether universal pre-kindergarten (UPK) raises parents' earnings and how much these earnings effects matter for evaluating the economic returns to UPK programs. Using a randomized lottery design, we estimate the effects of enrolling in a full-day UPK program in New Haven, Connecticut on parents' labor market outcomes as well as educational expenditures and children's academic performance. During children's pre-kindergarten years, UPK enrollment increases weekly childcare coverage by 11 hours. Enrollment has limited impacts on children's academic outcomes between kindergarten and 8th grade, likely due to a combination of rapid effect fadeout and substitution away from other programs of similar quality but with shorter days. In contrast, parents work more hours, and their earnings increase by 21.7%.  Parents' earnings gains persist for at least six years after the end of pre-kindergarten. Excluding impacts on children, each dollar of net government expenditure yields $5.51 in after-tax benefits for families, almost entirely from parents' earnings gains. This return is large compared to other labor market policies. Conversely, excluding earnings gains for parents, each dollar of net government expenditure yields only $0.46 to $1.32 in benefits, lower than many other education and children's health interventions. We conclude that the economic returns to investing in UPK are high, largely because of full-day UPK's effectiveness as an active labor market policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33038,33038,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
Transmission of Family Influence,"Sadegh S.M. Eshaghnia, James J. Heckman, Rasmus Landersø & Rafeh Qureshi","This paper studies intergenerational mobility—the transmission of family influence. We develop and estimate measures of lifetime resources motivated by economic theory that account for differences in life-cycle trajectories, and uncertainty about future income. We identify the effects of parents’ resources on child outcomes through policy shocks at different childhood ages that affect family investments. Parents’ expected lifetime resources are stronger predictors of child outcomes than the income measures traditionally used in the literature on social mobility. Moreover, while effects estimated through exogenous variation in parents’ expected lifetime resources are smaller in magnitude than their correlational counterparts, they are still sizable and largest in early childhood. The paper illustrates how integrating key insights from different literatures when studying intergenerational mobility allows for a better understanding of the importance of factors such as the family’s role, changes in individual life cycles across generations, and the expectations and trajectories individuals face across their lifetimes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33023,33023,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
The Causal Effects of Inflation Uncertainty on Households' Beliefs and Actions,Dimitris Georgarakos ⓡ Yuriy Gorodnichenko ⓡ Olivier Coibion ⓡ Geoff Kenny,"We implement a survey-based randomized information treatment that generates independent variation in the inflation expectations and the uncertainty about future inflation of European households. This variation allows us to assess how both first and second moments of inflation expectations separately affect subsequent household decisions. We document several key findings. First, higher inflation uncertainty leads households to reduce their subsequent durable goods purchases for several months, while a higher expected level of inflation increases them. Second, an increase in uncertainty about inflation induces households to tilt their portfolios towards safe and away from riskier asset holdings. Third, higher inflation uncertainty encourages household job search, leading to higher subsequent employment among the unemployed and less under-employment among the employed. Finally, we document that the level of inflation expectations has a different effect from uncertainty in inflation expectations and thus it is crucial to take into account both to measure their separate effects on decisions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33014,33014,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024

Understanding the Heterogeneity of Intergenerational Mobility across Neighborhoods,"Neil A. Cholli, Steven N. Durlauf, Rasmus Landersø & Salvador Navarro","Recent research has uncovered large spatial heterogeneity in intergenerational mobility across neighborhoods in countries around the world. Yet there is little consensus on the reasons why mobility is high in some neighborhoods and low in others. This paper analyzes a generalized mobility model that examines the roles that families’ selection into neighborhoods and locational characteristics play in generating this spatial heterogeneity. We use administrative data from Denmark to decompose variation in mobility across nearly 300 larger and 2,000 smaller neighborhoods along these dimensions, accounting for sampling error. Families’ selection into neighborhoods and sampling error explain most observed heterogeneity across neighborhoods. Our generalized model explains most of the differences in mobility between neighborhoods, though a small but persistent difference remains between neighborhoods that our model cannot account for. An analysis of this “irreducible heterogeneity” suggests that neighborhoods exhibit multiple types in terms of their mobility effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33035,33035,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
Misperceptions and Demand for Democracy under Authoritarianism,"Daron Acemoglu, Cevat Giray Aksoy, Ceren Baysan, Carlos Molina & Gamze Zeki","This paper investigates whether enduring authoritarian regimes are in part rooted in the population’s misperceptions about their social and economic costs—as opposed to a general preference for authoritarianism. We explore this question using online and field experiments in the context of Türkiye’s May 2023 presidential and parliamentary elections. We confirm that voters, especially those supporting the incumbent authoritarian government systematically underestimate the extent to which democracy and media freedom have been eroded in Türkiye and their usefulness in dealing with natural disasters and corruption (two salient issues in Türkiye). We find that providing (accurate) information about the state and implications of democracy and media freedom have significant effects on beliefs and increase the likelihood of voting for the opposition by about 3.7 percentage points (6.2 percent) in the online experiment. In the field experiment, we estimate similarly-sized impacts on the ballot-box level vote share—with the information treatment leading to a 2.4 percentage point (4.4 percent) increase in the opposition’s vote share. Interestingly, both in the field and online, the results are driven not by further mobilizing opposition supporters, but by influencing those likely to vote for the governing coalition and those holding more misperceived beliefs about democracy and media freedom in Türkiye. The evidence suggests that at least part of the support for authoritarian regimes may be coming from misperceptions about their institutions and policies, and may be more malleable than typically presumed.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33018,33018,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
The Impact of Intergenerational Transfers on the Distribution of Wealth: An International Comparison,Charles Yuji Horioka,"In this paper, I analyze detailed data on intergenerational transfers in 4 countries (China, India, Japan, and the United States) from the “Japan Household Panel Survey on Consumer Preferences and Satisfaction (JHPS-CPS)” which has been conducted by the Institute of Social and Economic Research of Osaka University in these 4 countries since 2003, in order to shed light on the impact of intergenerational transfers on household wealth disparities and on possible reasons for the substantial differences in household wealth disparities among the 4 countries. Almost all of the evidence I present suggests that intergenerational transfers have a disequalizing impact on household wealth disparities and promote the transmission of household wealth disparities from generation to generation in all 4 countries although the magnitude of these effects varies considerably from country to country.

Carbon Tariffs 101,Claire Brunel & Arik Levinson,"We evaluate the economic and environmental consequences of taxes on imported goods based on their carbon content. The analysis uses the simplest possible partial equilibrium framework, with one small open economy and a global pollution externality. It relies on graphs of supply and demand, rather than equations or formulas, hoping to reach readers familiar with basic economics. Despite its simplicity, the framework imparts numerous lessons. (1) Absent a domestic price on carbon, a carbon tariff imposes the same costs on domestic consumers as a domestic carbon price, but a carbon tariff also subsidizes domestic pollution. (2) If one small country imposes a carbon tariff, with or without a domestic carbon tax, the economic incidence of the tariff falls on its consumers. (3) If a holdout country joins the rest of the world by enacting its own carbon regulation and consequently imports more from other countries, those increased imports are not “leakage.” They are the cessation of leakage from when the holdout country’s policy was lax. And (4) if other countries do not appropriately regulate emissions, no single small country can use a combination of carbon taxes and carbon tariffs to fully correct the problem caused by its consumers or producers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33024,33024,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024

Second, in the design and implementation stage, we focus on GenAI’s role in identifying new channels of variation, piloting and documentation, and upholding the four exclusion restrictions. Third, in the analysis stage, we explore how prompting and training set bias can impact results as well as necessary steps to ensure replicability.

Crucially, the reaction of MMF assets and stablecoin market capitalization to monetary policy shocks is different: while prime-MMF assets rise after a monetary policy tightening, stablecoin market capitalization declines.

Decarbonizing Heat: The Impact of Heat Pumps and a Time-of-Use Heat Pump Tariff on Energy Demand,"Louise Bernard, Andy Hackett, Robert D. Metcalfe & Andrew Schein","Heat pumps have been proposed as the leading technology in the electrification of domestic heat and therefore could play a crucial part in the transition to low-carbon energy systems. However, there is very little causal evidence of the impact of heat pumps on energy demand and the impact of marginal prices to help optimize energy demand with heat pumps. We leverage a staggered roll-out of heat pumps from Octopus Energy Group to show that: (1) heat pumps have a large impact on energy demand, on average causing a 90% reduction in home gas use and a 61% increase in home electricity use – overall, households reduced total energy demand by 40% and carbon dioxide emissions by 36% in 2024 (with an average of 68% emissions savings over the lifetime of the heat pump); (2) a time-of-use tariff designed for heat pumps can provide large demand flexibility benefits, halving electricity consumption during the evening peak to help balance the grid, and that load shifting is possible on the coldest days and from all building types in our sample; (3) the marginal value of public funds of the current UK heat pump subsidy is £1.24 (for every £1 spent by the Government). Overall, we find that heat pumps can meaningfully decarbonize heat and subsidies to encourage heat pumps can be welfare-enhancing.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33036,33036,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024

Cross-Country Analysis of Labor Markets during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Robert Breunig, Wei Cheng, Laura Montenovo, Kyoung Hoon Lee, Bruce A.

While the share of people not at work increased in all countries, safety net policies seem to influence whether people remained employed (but absent from work) versus unemployed or left the labor force. The authors find large employment decreases among middle-educated and young workers, increasing disparities in countries with the largest labor market declines. A variety of evidence suggests that labor demand was likely a larger driver of employment declines than labor supply and that stringent social distancing policies were sufficient to reduce employment even in the absence of high cases. Lastly, job characteristics - the importance of face-to-face interactions and the ability to work remotely - were closely related to labor market outcomes, with these relationships being stronger in countries with more cases.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33029,33029,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
Capital requirements in Pillar 1 or Pillar 2: does it matter for market discipline?,Niklas Witte,"The results of this paper provide empirical evidence that regulatory capital ratios drive bank Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and that markets react more to changes in capital requirements if implemented via direct adjustments to Pillar 1 risk weights than imposed as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs) under Pillar 2. In other words, market discipline on bank capital adequacy is sensitive to the composition of the capital requirement stack. Therefore, this paper contributes novel insights to existing research on the market relevance of regulatory capital ratios, on the functioning of the Basel framework, and on market discipline along with its relationship with Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 capital requirements. The findings are relevant in light of the continuous discussions around the capital regulation for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) and other Pillar 2 risks because they suggest that risks are more disciplined by markets if they are reflected in regulatory capital ratios via RWAs. Moreover, the results suggest that further regulatory alignment within the EU can impact the comparability of regulatory capital ratios and affect pricing decisions. In the first empirical step, the research investigates the drivers of CDS and identifies a significant relationship between CDS spreads and regulatory capital ratios. In the second step, the paper researches a quasi-natural experiment based on an event in the EU banking sector. In 2018, the Swedish supervisory authority changed the implementation approach of a risk weight floor on Swedish mortgages by shifting it from Pillar 2 to Pillar 1 while keeping total capital requirements stable. To assess if this merely technical regulatory adjustment triggered an unexpected reaction by markets, a two-step system Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) regression is applied to a sample of CDS spreads of 21 European banks between 2014 and 2020.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2988~25e3305cfa.en.pdf?40658e3bf55a54c3d19423c59b4d049a,2988,7 October 2024,ECB,10/07/2024
"Online Business Models, Digital Ads, and User Welfare","Daron Acemoglu, Daniel Huttenlocher, Asuman Ozdaglar & James Siderius","We present a model where social media platforms offer plans that intermix entertaining content with digital advertising (“ads”). Users derive utility from entertainment and learn about their valuation for a product from ads. While some users are fully rational, others naïvely perceive digital ads as more informative than they actually are. We characterize the profit-maximizing business model of the platform and show that welfare is lower when the platform monetizes through advertising instead of subscription both for naïfs (because they are targeted by intense digital advertising, which makes them over-optimistic about product quality and over-purchase the product) and for sophisticates (because the inflated demand from naïfs increases the firm’s price). This negative welfare effect is intensified when the platform can offer mixed business models that separate the naïve and sophisticated users into different plans. Our results are robust to firm-level and platform-level competition, because digital ads soften competition between both firms and platforms. We also show how digital ad taxes can improve welfare.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33017,33017,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
Theorizing with Large Language Models,"Matteo Tranchero, Cecil-Francis Brenninkmeijer, Arul Murugan & Abhishek Nagaraj","Large Language Models (LLMs) are proving to be a powerful toolkit for management and organizational research. While early work has largely focused on the value of these tools for data processing and replicating survey-based research, the potential of LLMs for theory building is yet to be recognized. We argue that LLMs can accelerate the pace at which researchers can develop, validate, and extend strategic management theory. We propose a novel framework called Generative AI-Based Experimentation (GABE) that enables researchers to conduct exploratory in silico experiments that can mirror the complexities of real-world organizational settings, featuring multiple agents and strategic interdependencies. This approach is unique because it allows researchers to unpack the mechanisms behind results by directly modifying agents’ roles, preferences, and capabilities, and asking them to reveal the explanations behind decisions. We apply this framework to a novel theory studying strategic exploration under uncertainty. We show how our framework can not only replicate the results from experiments with human subjects at a much lower cost, but can also be used to extend theory by clarifying boundary conditions and uncovering mechanisms. We conclude that LLMs possess tremendous potential to complement existing methods for theorizing in strategy and, more broadly, the social sciences.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33033,33033,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
Pitfalls of Demographic Forecasts of US Elections,"Richard Calvo, Vincent Pons & Jesse M. Shapiro","Many observers have forecast large partisan shifts in the US electorate based on demographic trends. Such forecasts are appealing because demographic trends are often predictable even over long horizons. We backtest demographic forecasts using data on US elections since 1952. We envision a forecaster who fits a model using data from a given election and uses that model, in tandem with a projection of demographic trends, to predict future elections. Even a forecaster with perfect knowledge of future demographic trends would have performed poorly over this period—worse even than one who simply guesses that each election will have a 50-50 partisan split. Enriching the set of demographics available does not change this conclusion. We discuss both mechanical and economic reasons for this finding, and show suggestive evidence that parties adjust their platforms in accordance with changes in the electorate.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33016,33016,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow? Toward an Understanding of Fade-out in Early Childhood Education Programs",John A. List & Haruka Uchida,"An unsettling stylized fact is that decorated early childhood education programs improve cognitive skills in the short-term, but lose their efficacy after a few years. We implement a field experiment with two stages of randomization to explore the underpinnings of the fade-out effect. We first randomly assign preschool access to children, and then partner with the local school district to randomly assign the same children to classmates throughout elementary school. We find that the fade-out effect is critically-linked to the share of classroom peers assigned to preschool access—with enough treated peers the classic fade-out effect is muted. Our results highlight a paradoxical insight: while the fade-out effect has been viewed as a devastating critique of early childhood programs, our results highlight that fade-out is a key rationale for providing early education to all children. This is because human capital accumulation is inherently a social activity, leading early education programs to deliver their largest benefits at scale when everyone receives such programs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33027,33027,October 2024,NBER,10/07/2024
Collusion in Repeated Auctions with Costless Communication,Roberto B. Pinheiro,"In this paper, we present a model of repeated first-price private value auctions in which the bidders have access to a cheap talk communication mechanism. In this framework, messages allow bidders to transmit their preference rankings over the goods to be auctioned, similar to Pesendorfer (2000). We show that collusion through this static mechanism not only dominates the static bid rotation mechanism presented by McAfee and McMillan (1992), but it is also not strictly dominated by the dynamic bid rotation mechanism presented by Aoyagi (2003). However, we show that asymptotic efficiency of collusion through increasing the number of ordered goods, presented by Pesendorfer (2000), demands patience rates to asymptotically approach one, making collusion increasingly more difficult to sustain. Finally, we study mechanisms through which the auctioneer may try to break bidders' collusion.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2421-collusion-in-repeated-auctions-with-costless-communication,24-21,10.07.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,10/08/2024

Wage Growth and Labor Market Tightness,"Sebastian Heise, Jeremy Pearce, and Jacob P. Weber","Good measures of labor market tightness are essential to predict wage inflation and to calibrate monetary policy. This paper highlights the importance of two measures of labor market tightness in determining wage growth: the quits rate, and vacancies per effective searcher (V/ES)—where searchers include both employed and non-employed job seekers. Amongst a broad set of indicators of labor market tightness, we find that these two measures are independently the most strongly correlated with wage inflation and also predict wage growth well in out-of-sample forecasting exercises. Conversely, transitory shocks to productivity have little impact on wage growth. Finally, we find little evidence of a nonlinearity in the relationship between wage growth and labor market tightness. These results are generally consistent with the predictions of a New Keynesian DSGE model where firms have the power to set wages and workers search on the job (Bloesch, Lee, and Weber, 2024).",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1128,1128,2024-10-08,FED-NEWYORK,10/09/2024
Uniform Priors for Impulse Responses,"Jonas Arias, Juan F. Rubio-Ramírez, Daniel F. Waggoner","A previous version of this working paper was originally published in September 2022. There has been a call for caution regarding the standard procedure for Bayesian inference in set-identified structural vector autoregressions on the grounds that the common practice of using a uniform prior over the set of orthogonal matrices induces a non-uniform prior for individual impulse responses or other quantities of interest. This paper challenges this call by formally showing that when the focus is on joint inference, the uniform prior over the set of orthogonal matrices is not only sufficient but also necessary for inference based on a uniform joint prior distribution over the identified set for the vector of impulse responses. In addition, we show how to conduct inference based on a uniform joint prior distribution for the vector of impulse responses.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/macroeconomics/uniform-priors-for-impulse-responses,22-30,Revised: October 2024,FED-PHILADELPHIA,10/09/2024
News Selection and Household Inflation Expectations,"Ryan Chahrour, Adam Shapiro, Daniel Wilson","We examine the impact of systematic media reporting on household inflation expectations, focusing on how selective news coverage influences household responses to inflation news. In a model where monitoring all economic developments is costly, households will account for news selection when forming inflation expectations. The model implies an asymmetry: news about high inflation influences inflation expectations more than news about low inflation. Using micro panel data, we find support for this hypothesis. Exposure to news about higher prices increases household inflation expectations by approximately 0.4 percentage point, whereas exposure to news about lower prices has no discernible effect.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/10/news-selection-and-household-inflation-expectations,2024-31,2024-10-09,FED-SANFRANCISCO,10/10/2024

Employment both overall and among those living in low-income families has been on a downward trajectory across the last three decades. One notable exception is that low-income women with children were increasingly likely to work between 1992 and 1999 in the aftermath of large changes to social safety net programs to provide more incentives and rewards for work. Since then, low-income women with children have been more likely to be employed than childless women.

It makes three main contributions. First, we carry out a meta-analysis – updating Hsiang et al (2013) and Burke et al (2015) with a far larger sample – and confirm that extreme climate is associated with elevated risk of inter-group conflict, intra-personal violence, and self-harm. The estimated average effects are smaller than the earlier estimates, although they remain meaningful in magnitude and highly statistically significant. Second, we present a methodological discussion and empirical illustration of how the use of data at different spatial and temporal scales can affect these results. Third, we discuss specific studies that present evidence on the mechanisms underlying this relationship including: (1) economic conditions, income, and agricultural productivity; (2) socio-demographic factors; (3) migration and transportation costs; (4) policy, politics and institutions; and (5) psychological and physiological factors.

Industrial Policy: Lessons from Shipbuilding,"Panle Jia Barwick, Myrto Kalouptsidi & Nahim B. Zahur","Industrial policy has been used throughout history in some form or other by most countries. Yet, it remains one of the most contentious issues among policymakers and economists alike. In part, this is because the empirical evidence on whether and how it should be implemented remains slim. Scant data on government subsidies, conflicting theoretical arguments, and the need to account for governments’ short and long-run objectives, render research particularly challenging. In this article, we outline a theory-based empirical methodology that relies on estimating an industry equilibrium model to measure hidden subsidies, assess their welfare consequences for the domestic and global economy, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of different policy designs. We illustrate this approach using the global shipbuilding industry as a prototypical example of an industry targeted by industrial policy, especially in periods of heavy industrialization. Just in the past century, Europe, followed by Japan, then South Korea, and more recently China, developed national shipbuilding programs to propel their firms to global leaders. Success has been mixed across programs, certainly by welfare metrics, and sometimes even by growth metrics. We use our methodology on China to dissect the impact of such programs, what made them more or less successful, and how we can justify why governments have chosen shipbuilding as a target.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33043,33043,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
"Income, Wealth, and Environmental Inequality in the United States","Jonathan M. Colmer, Suvy Qin, John L. Voorheis & Reed Walker","This paper explores the relationships between air pollution, income, wealth, and race by combining administrative data from U.S. tax returns between 1979-2016, various measures of air pollution, and sociodemographic information from linked survey and administrative data. In the first year of our data, the relationship between income and ambient pollution levels nationally is approximately zero for both non-Hispanic White and Black individuals. However, at every single percentile of the national income distribution, Black individuals are exposed to, on average, higher levels of pollution than White individuals. By 2016, the relationship between income and air pollution had steepened, primarily for Black individuals, driven by changes in where rich and poor Black individuals live. We utilize quasi-random shocks to income to examine the causal effect of changes in income and wealth on pollution exposure over a five year horizon, finding that these income-pollution elasticities map closely to the values implied by our descriptive patterns. We calculate that Black-White differences in income can explain approximately 10 percent of the observed gap in air pollution levels in 2016.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33050,33050,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
"Job Search, Wages, and Inflation",Laura Pilossoph & Jane M. Ryngaert,"How do inflation expectations affect the job search behavior of workers when wages are set in nominal terms? A canonical job search model incorporating nominal wage rigidities implies that on-the-job search should increase and reservation wages should decrease with expected inflation.  Higher inflation expectations therefore lead to more frequent job-to-job transitions. We show in a novel survey that workers search more under higher values of hypothetical inflation. In the Survey of Consumer Expectations, workers with higher inflation expectations have lower reservation wages and are more likely to search and  to change jobs. The relationship between expected inflation and employer-to-employer transitions also appears in aggregate time series data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33042,33042,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
"Poverty, Hardship, and Government Transfers","Bruce D. Meyer, Jeehoon Han & James X. Sullivan","We examine how the well-being of those with few resources changed, amidst economic disruption and large, transitory government transfers. We find that in the years leading up to the pandemic and in 2020, the patterns for income and consumption poverty were very similar. In 2021 and 2022, however, changes in income and consumption poverty were quite different—consumption poverty fell less than income poverty in 2021, and then income poverty rose sharply in 2022 while consumption poverty continued to decline. Reports of hardships rose in 2022 for both families with and without children, suggesting increased concern about financial well-being as COVID-era transfer programs expired. A key difference between income and consumption measures appears to be saving during the pandemic followed by dissaving, even among those near the poverty line. This finding indicates that permanent income models can even be relevant when low-income households, that typically have very limited saving, receive very large transitory payments. Unlike past academic studies and numerous politicians and pundits that have attributed most of the decline in income poverty in 2021, and its subsequent rise in 2022, to the Child Tax Credit, we show that expanded Unemployment Insurance and stimulus payments played a larger role.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33052,33052,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
Early-Life Local Labor Market Conditions and Old-Age Male Mortality: Evidence from Historical Deindustrialization of the New England Textile Sector,Hamid Noghanibehambari & Jason Fletcher,"Previous studies document the potential links between early-life insults and life-cycle outcomes. However, fewer studies examine the effects of local labor market shocks during early-life on old-age male mortality. This article empirically investigates this link using a large-scale deindustrialization as a source of shocks to local labor markets: the decline in the New England’s textile industry during the 1920s and 1930s. Consistent with prior studies, we find small impacts on migration and changes in sociodemographic composition of counties post-deindustrialization. Using Social Security Administration death records linked with historical censuses 1900-1940 and difference-in-difference event studies, we find reductions in longevity for those born in highly-exposed counties whose families are categorized as non-migrants and those residing in non-urban areas. The results suggest intent-to-treat effects of about 3.3 months while the treatment-on-treated calculations suggest reductions of about 4 years in longevity of children of affected families. Using 1950-1960 census data, we find that those born in highly-exposed counties post-deindustrialization reveal large reductions in schooling, decreases in high school completion, and significant decreases in measures of socioeconomic standing. We further discuss the policy implication of these findings.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33039,33039,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
Platform Power Struggle: Spotify and the Major Record Labels,"Luis Aguiar, Joel Waldfogel & Axel Zeijen","Digitization has facilitated the emergence of large distribution platforms downstream from traditionally powerful suppliers. Digital platforms can carry many suppliers’ products, test the products’ consumer appeal, and choose which products to promote, potentially shifting power from the suppliers to the platforms. We study these forces in the recorded music industry, which was traditionally dominated by a few  “major” record labels distributing their products through fragmented radio stations and retailers. Now, the majors receive most of their promotion and distribution through platforms like Spotify, which carry millions of songs from both major and “independent” suppliers. We study Spotify’s use of playlists using data covering 2017-2020. First, Spotify used their expanded playlist capacity to test – and discover – proportionately more independent songs to promote on their playlists. Second, at least relative to major-label playlists, Spotify-operated playlists promoted new independent songs more than was indicated by their subsequent success. Third, placement on Spotify new-music playlists has a large causal impact on streams. The independent-label share of new-music promotion rose from 38 percent in late 2017 to 55 percent in early 2020, which helps to explain the reported decline in the share of Spotify royalty payments to major-label suppliers over the same period.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33048,33048,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
"Bucky, Becky, and Student Financial Aid Policy Design","Elise A. Marifian, Jeffrey A. Smith & Sarah Turner","Bucky’s Tuition Promise (BTP) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison offers generous financial aid to low-income, in-state students. Unlike many similar programs at other public universities, financial eligibility for BTP depends solely on a family’s Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), rather than on the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or some function of the poverty line. This program design aims to make eligibility simpler and more transparent for students and their families and thereby to encourage application and matriculation. We investigate the implications of the program design for who does and does not receive additional institutional aid, with a particular focus on the marginal group of BTP-eligible students who lack Federal Pell Grant eligibility. With this analysis, we aim to motivate a broader discussion of different notions of equity in financial aid administration and the tough tradeoffs implicit in simplifying eligibility criteria.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33053,33053,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
Transitional Market Dynamics in Complex Environments,"C. Lanier Benkard, Przemyslaw Jeziorski & Gabriel Weintraub","This paper presents a new approach to modeling transitional dynamics in dynamic models of imperfect competition, a crucial yet often neglected aspect of empirical models in industrial organization that seek to understand market responses to policy and environmental changes. We introduce Nonstationary Oblivious Equilibrium (NOE),  a computationally efficient  equilibrium concept based on a mean-field approximation designed to model short- and medium-run market dynamics. Addressing potential limitations of NOE in more concentrated markets or under aggregate shocks, we propose a variant, NOE with Re-solving (RNOE). RNOE modifies firms' strategies by re-computing NOE as industry states get realized; an iterative process inspired by real-world industry practice that has behavioral appeal. We show the potential of NOE and RNOE by applying them to an empirical setting of technology adoption and to two classic dynamic oligopoly models, demonstrating that, in a wide variety of settings of empirical interest, they generate equilibrium behavior that is close to Markov perfect equilibrium in both the short and long runs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33045,33045,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
Modeling Migration-Induced Unemployment,Pascal Michaillat,"Immigration is often blamed for increasing unemployment among local workers. However, standard models, such as the neoclassical model and the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides matching model, inherently assume that immigrants are absorbed into the labor market without affecting local unemployment. This paper presents a more general model of migration that allows for the possibility that not only the wages but also the unemployment rate of local workers may be affected by the arrival of newcomers. This extension is essential to capture the full range of potential impacts of labor migration on labor markets. The model blends a matching framework with job rationing. In it, the arrival of new workers can raise the unemployment rate among local workers, particularly in a depressed labor market where job opportunities are limited. On the positive side, in-migration helps firms fill vacancies more easily, boosting their profits. The overall impact of in-migration on local welfare varies with labor market conditions: in-migration reduces welfare when the labor market is inefficiently slack, but it enhances welfare when the labor market is inefficiently tight.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33047,33047,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
"Long-Term Contracts, Commitment, and Optimal Information Disclosure",Alessandro Dovis & Paolo Martellini,"This paper studies optimal information disclosure in dynamic insurance economies with income risk in which an incumbent firm acquires more information about a consumer's persistent type than the rest of the market does. We find that if the incumbent can commit to long-term contracts but the consumer can walk away, the optimal disclosure prescribes no information revelation to maximize cross-subsidization. However, if the incumbent lacks commitment, no cross-subsidization of low-income consumers is feasible for any public information disclosure because of adverse selection. We show that partial information disclosure is typically optimal and it aims at implementing intertemporal consumption smoothing between the first period and the high-state in the second period, generating an inverse of the back-loading result in Harris and Holmstrom (1982). Lastly, we show that, without commitment, banning long-term relations can be beneficial to consumers. Our results can be used to analyze the consequences of policy proposals such as open banking and consumer data ownership.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33051,33051,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
Health Insurance and Part-Time Employment: The Influence of the Affordable Care Act,Katharine G. Abraham & Henry S. Farber,"Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), part-time workers were much less likely than full-time workers to have health insurance. The ACA included multiple provisions intended to raise health insurance coverage rates, including a mandate that employers provide affordable coverage to full-time workers, a requirement that dependents be allowed to remain on their parents’ plan until age 26, extensions of Medicaid coverage, and the establishment of health insurance exchanges on which lower-income households could purchase subsidized coverage. Implementation of these provisions was associated with a decline in the full-time/part-time coverage gap from 6.5 percentage points in 2013 to 3.1 percentage points in 2021. Increases in Medicaid coverage and insurance purchased on the exchanges reduced were the largest contributors to the reduction in the full-time/part-time coverage gap.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33046,33046,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
Digital Distractions with Peer Influence: The Impact of Mobile App Usage on Academic and Labor Market Outcomes,"Panle Jia Barwick, Siyu Chen, Chao Fu & Teng Li","Concerns over the excessive use of mobile phones, especially among youths and young adults, are growing. Leveraging administrative student data from a Chinese university merged with mobile phone records, random roommate assignments, and a policy shock that affects peers’ peers, we present, to our knowledge, the first estimates of both behavioral spillover and contextual peer effects, and the first estimates of medium-term impacts of mobile app usage on academic achievement, physical health, and labor market outcomes. App usage is contagious: a one s.d. increase in roommates’ in-college app usage raises own app usage by 4.4% on average, with substantial heterogeneity across students. App usage is detrimental to both academic performance and labor market outcomes. A one s.d. increase in own app usage reduces GPAs by 36.2% of a within-cohort-major s.d. and lowers wages by 2.3%. Roommates’ app usage exerts both direct effects (e.g., noise and disruptions) and indirect effects (via behavioral spillovers) on GPA and wage, resulting in a total negative impact of over half the size of the own usage effect. Extending China’s minors’ game restriction policy of 3 hours per week to college students would boost their initial wages by 0.7%. Using high-frequency GPS data, we identify one underlying mechanism: high app usage crowds out time in study halls and increases absences from and late arrivals at lectures.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33054,33054,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024
Slack and Economic Development,Michael W. Walker ⓡ Nachiket Shah ⓡ Edward Miguel ⓡ Dennis Egger ⓡ Felix Samy Soliman ⓡ Tilman Graff,"Slack – the underutilization of factors of production – varies systematically with economic development. Using novel and detailed measures of the utilization of labor and capital from a large representative sample of firms in rural and urban Kenya, we show that utilization is increasing in firm size, market access, and economic activity. We present a model of firm capacity choice where indivisibility in at least one input is a key driver of slack. We embed the model in spatial general equilibrium, with features characteristic of low-income settings – including many small firms and high transport costs – and show that it rationalizes both the endogenous emergence of slack in steady-state and elastic aggregate supply curves. We empirically validate model predictions using reduced-form estimates of the general equilibrium effects of cash transfers from a large-scale RCT in Kenya. The parsimonious model replicates much of the experimental evidence, predicting a large real multiplier of 1.5, driven by expansion in low-utilization sectors and firms, and limited average price inflation. Counterfactual analyses indicate that multipliers are likely to be meaningfully smaller in lower slack settings, such as urban areas. We use the model to revisit the estimation of spatial spillovers in clustered RCTs and uncover non-trivial ’missing intercept’ effects on income and inflation. Additionally, we innovate methodologically by pre-registering key elements of model estimation and validation. The findings suggest that input indivisibilities and slack are key features of developing country settings, and are quantitatively important for macroeconomic dynamics and policies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33055,33055,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024

Why Didn't the U.S. Unemployment Rate Rise at the End of WWII?,"Shigeru Fujita, Valerie A. Ramey & Tal Roded","This paper investigates why the U.S. unemployment rate rose only a few percentage points despite the dramatic decline in government spending and other upheaval at the end of World War II. Using a new longitudinal data set based on archival sources and government surveys, we study the many facets of this question. We find five main results. First, withdrawals from the labor force at the end of WWII were an important part of the explanation for the small rise in the unemployment rate. These withdrawals tended to be concentrated among females between the ages of 20 and 44 and male war veterans. Second, among those staying in the labor force, most of the workers who separated from their jobs moved directly into a new job. Third, workers accomplished these job-to-job transitions despite moving across industries. Fourth, returning veterans quickly returned to their previous position on the occupation ladder whereas those laid off from civilian jobs experienced a significant step down the occupation ladder. Fifth, a neoclassical model suggests that the post-war boom in job creation was a direct consequence of the crowding out of investment in consumer durable goods, residential capital, and business capital by military spending during the war.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33041,33041,October 2024,NBER,10/14/2024

Monetary policy and growth-at-risk: the role of institutional quality,"Lorenz Emter, Ralph Setzer, Nico Zorell, Afonso S. Moura","This paper analyses how country-specific institutional quality shapes the impact of monetary policy on downside risks to GDP growth in the euro area. Using identified high-frequency shocks in a growth-at-risk framework, we show that monetary policy has a higher impact on downside risks in the short term than in the medium term. However, this result for the euro area average hides significant heterogeneity across countries. In economies with weak institutional quality, medium-term growth risks increase substantially following contractionary monetary policy shocks. In contrast, these risks remain relatively stable in countries with high institutional quality. This suggests that improvements in institutional quality could significantly enhance euro area countries’ economic resilience and support the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2989~15a3617c8c.en.pdf?f48d3d3407698dc9080e3e46ed1b690a,2989,18 October 2024,ECB,10/18/2024

Community bank boards have fewer members and a higher percentage of insiders than larger publicly traded banks, and experience little turnover during normal times. Their meetings are held monthly and span about two hours. During times of distress, community bank boards convene less often in regularly scheduled meetings in lieu of impromptu meetings, experience higher turnover, particularly among their independent directors, and their meeting tone switches from neutral to significantly negative.

We calculate the growth in median rents and home values in each to the five groups and find that those with steep increases in the Black population share show the smallest increases in home values and rent implying that Black households that bought homes in these neighborhoods in 1950 or 1960 were likely to have lost money or barely broken even by 1990.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-22,2024-22,October 2024,FED-CHICAGO,10/18/2024

Unique Implementation of Permanent Primary Deficits?,"Amol Amol, Erzo G.J. Luttmer","In an economy with incomplete markets and consumers who are sufficiently risk averse, we show that the government can uniquely implement a permanent primary deficit using nominal debt and continuous Markov strategies for primary deficits and payments to debtholders. But this result fails if there are also useless pieces of paper (bitcoin for short) that can be traded. If there is trade in bitcoin, then there is no continuous Markov strategy for the government that leads to unique implementation. Instead, there is a continuum of equilibria with distinct real allocations in which the price of bitcoin converges to zero. And there is a balanced budget trap: continuous government policies designed for a permanent primary deficit cannot eliminate an alternative steady state in which _r_ - _g_ = 0 and the government is forced to balance its budget. A legal prohibition against bitcoin can restore unique implementation of permanent primary deficits, and so can a tax on bitcoin at the rate -(_r_ - _g_) > 0.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/working-papers/unique-implementation-of-permanent-primary-deficits,807,"October 17, 2024",FED-MINNEAPOLIS,10/19/2024

When alphas are weak and rare, estimation errors hinder arbitrageurs—even those employing optimal machine learning techniques—from fully exploiting all true pricing errors. This statistical limit to arbitrage widens the equilibrium bounds of alphas beyond what traditional arbitrage pricing theory predicts, leading to a significant divergence between the feasible Sharpe ratio achievable by arbitrageurs and the unattainable theoretical maximum under perfect knowledge of alphas.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33070,33070,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024

The income-longevity gradient for the top vs. bottom five percent of incomes is 9 years of post-54 life for men and 7 years for women.

The Impact of United States Assimilation and Allotment Policy on American Indian Mortality,"Grant Miller, Jack Shane & C. Matthew Snipp","In contrast to earlier United States policies of open war, forcible removal, and relocation to address the “Indian Problem,” the Dawes Act of 1887 focused on assimilation and land severalty — making American Indians citizens of the United States with individually-titled plots of land rather than members of collective tribes with communal land. Considerable scholarship shows that the consequences of the policy differed substantially from its stated goals, and by the time of its repeal in 1934, American Indians had lost two-thirds of all native land held in 1887 (86 million acres)—and nearly two-thirds of American Indians had become landless or unable to meet subsistence needs. Complementing rich qualitative history, this paper provides new quantitative evidence on the impact of the Dawes Act on mortality among American Indian children and adults. Using 1900 and 1910 U.S. population census data to study both household and tribe-level variation in allotment timing, we find that assimilation and allotment policy increased various measures of American Indian child and adult mortality from nearly 20% to as much as one third (implying a decline in life expectancy at birth of about 20%) — confirming contemporary critics’ adamant concerns about the Dawes Act.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33057,33057,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024
"How Do Electoral Votes, Presidential Approval, and Consumer Sentiment Respond to Economic Indicators?",Robert J. Gordon,"This paper studies the effect of economic indicators on the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, Presidential approval ratings, and Presidential election outcomes since 1956.  How closely do the indicators predict sentiment, how well does sentiment predict approval, and what role does approval have in explaining election outcomes measured by electoral votes?  How much of the variance of approval ratings depends on non-economic factors like the “honeymoon effect”?  Is there a role for economic indicators in explaining election outcomes once the contribution of approval ratings is taken into account?  Regression equations provide answers to these questions and allow new interpretations of political history.  Equation residuals and the contributions of specific variables are graphically displayed, providing insights into time intervals when sentiment was above or below the prediction of economic indicators, when approval differed from its usual relation with sentiment and the indicators, and when and why the electoral vote totals in each election since 1956 exceeded or fell short of the predictions of the econometric equations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33068,33068,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024
Generation and Impact of Novel Articles in Physics,"Jacques Mairesse, Michele Pezzoni & Frederique Sachwald","The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it investigates how the characteristics of a research team relate to the probability of generating a novel article. Second, once a novel article has been generated, it investigates the moderating effects of the team's characteristics on the impact of the article. We consider 42,493 teams of researchers publishing a corresponding number of articles in 273 reputed journals in physics from 2005 to 2009. We find that team experience and team specialization are negatively associated with the probability of generating a novel article. On the contrary, having already written novel articles in the past is positively associated with the probability of generating a novel article. When analyzing the impact of novel articles, we find that a novel article published by an experienced team receives fewer citations than a novel article published by a team with less experience and is published in a lower impact factor journal. We also find that a novel article published by a large established team of researchers receives more citations than a novel article published by a small newly formed team. The team size is also positively related to the impact factor of the journal in which the novel article is published.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33064,33064,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024
Optimal Dynamic Asset Allocation with Transaction Costs: The Role of Hedging Demands,"Pierre Collin-Dufresne, Kent D. Daniel & Mehmet Sağlam","A number of papers have solved for the optimal dynamic portfolio strategy when expected returns are time-varying and trading is costly, but only for agents with myopic utility. Non-myopic agents benefit from hedging against future shocks to the investment opportunity set even when transaction costs are zero (Merton, 1969, 1971). In this paper, we propose a solution to the dynamic portfolio allocation problem for non-myopic agents faced with a stochastic investment opportunity set when trading is costly. We show that the agent’s optimal policy is to trade toward an “aim” portfolio, the makeup of which depends both on transaction costs and on each asset’s correlation with changes in the investment opportunity set. The speed at which the agent should trade towards the aim portfolio depends both on the shock’s persistence and on the extent to which the shock can be effectively hedged. We illustrate the differences in portfolio makeup that result from considering hedging demands of a long-horizon investor using a set of simplified examples, and using a daily trading strategy based on the estimated relation between retail order imbalance and future returns.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33058,33058,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024
Variational inference for Bayesian panel VAR models,Lucas Ter Steege,"We study the application of approximate mean field variational inference algorithms to Bayesian panel VAR models in which an exchangeable prior is placed on the dynamic parameters and the residuals follow either a Gaussian or a Student-t distribution. This reduces the estimation time of possibly several hours using conventional MCMC methods to less than a minute using variational inference algorithms. Next to considerable speed improvements, our results show that the approximations accurately capture the dynamic effects of macroeconomic shocks as well as overall parameter uncertainty. The application with Student-t residuals shows that it is computationally easy to include the COVID-19 observations in Bayesian panel VARs, thus offering a fast way to estimate such models.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2991~f5f2cf91dc.en.pdf?039d3971fcda74f3c2c10d9d570c2ef4,2991,21 October 2024,ECB,10/21/2024
Estimating Peer Effects among College Students: Evidence from a Field Experiment of One-to-One Pairings in STEM,"Robert W. Fairlie, Daniel M. Oliver, Glenn Millhauser & Randa Roland","An extensive literature in the social sciences analyzes peer effects among students, but estimation is complicated by several major problems some of which cannot be solved even with random assignment. We design a field experiment and propose a new estimation technique to address these estimation problems including the mechanical problems associated with repeated observations within peer groups noted by Angrist (2014). The field experiment randomly assigns students to one-to-one partnerships in an important gateway STEM course at a large public university. We find no evidence of peer effects from estimates of exogenous peer effect models. We push further and estimate outcome-on-outcome models which sometimes reveal peer effects when exogenous models do not provide good proxies for ability. We find some limited evidence of small, positive outcome-on-outcome peer effects (which would have been missed without our new estimation technique). Standard estimation methods fail to detect peer effects and even return negative estimates in our Monte Carlo simulations because of the downward bias due to mechanical problems. Simulations reveal additional advantages of our technique especially when peer group sizes are fixed. Estimates of non-linear effects, heterogeneous effects, and different measures of peer ability and outcomes reveal mostly null effects but we find some evidence that low-ability peers negatively affect low-ability and medium-ability students. The findings in this setting of long-term, intensive interactions with classroom random assignment and “throwing everything at it” provide evidence of, at most, small positive peer effects contrasting with the common finding of large peer effects in previous studies in education.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33060,33060,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024
How Do Income-Driven Repayment Plans Benefit Student Debt Borrowers?,"Sylvain Catherine, Mehran Ebrahimian & Constantine Yannelis","The rapid rise in student loan balances has raised concerns among economists and policymakers. Using administrative credit bureau data, we find that nearly half of the increase in balances from 2010 to 2020 is due to deferred payments, largely driven by the expansion of income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which link payments to income. These plans help borrowers by smoothing consumption, insuring against labor income risk, and reducing the present value of future payments. We build a life-cycle model to quantify the welfare gains from this payment deferment and the channels through which borrower welfare increases. New, more generous IDR rules increase this transfers from taxpayers to borrowers without yielding net welfare gains. By lowering the average marginal cost of undergraduate debt to less than 50 cents per dollar, these rules may also incentivize excessive borrowing. We demonstrate that an optimally calibrated IDR plan can achieve similar welfare gains for borrowers at a much lower cost to taxpayers, and without encouraging additional borrowing, primarily through maturity extension.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33059,33059,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024
Inequality in Science: Who Becomes a Star?,Anna Airoldi & Petra Moser,"How does a person’s childhood socioeconomic status (SES) influence their chances to participate and succeed in science? To investigate this question, we use machine-learning methods to link scientists in a comprehensive biographical dictionary, the American Men of Science (1921), with their childhood home in the US Census and with publications. First, we show that children from low-SES homes were already severely underrepresented in the early 1900s. Second, we find that SES influences peer recognition, even conditional on participation: Scientists from high-SES families have 38% higher odds of becoming stars, controlling for age, publications, and disciplines. Using live-in servants as an alternative measure for SES confirms the strong link between childhood SES and becoming a star. Applying text analysis to assign scientists to disciplines, we find that mathematics is the only discipline in which SES influences stardom through the number and the quality of a scientist’s publications. Using detailed data on job titles to distinguish academic from industry scientists, we find that industry scientists have lower odds of being stars. Controlling for industry employment further strengthens the link between childhood SES and stardom. Elite undergraduate degrees explain more of the correlation between SES and stardom than any other control. At the same time, controls for birth order, family size, foreign-born parents, maternal education, patents, and connections with existing stars leave estimates unchanged, highlighting the importance of SES.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33063,33063,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024
"Information Externalities, Free Riding, and Optimal Exploration in the UK Oil Industry",Charles Hodgson,"Information spillovers between firms can reduce R&D incentives if competitors can free ride on innovations. However, strong property rights may impede cumulative research and lead to inefficient duplication. These effects are particularly relevant in natural resource exploration, where discoveries are spatially correlated. Using UK offshore oil exploration data, I estimate a dynamic model that captures the trade-off between drilling now and waiting to learn from competitors. Removing free-riding incentives increases industry surplus by 52%, while perfect information flow raises it by 24%. Counterfactual policy simulations highlight a trade-off in property rights design: stronger property rights over exploration well data increase the rate of exploration, while weaker property rights increase the efficiency and speed of learning but reduce the rate of exploration. Spatial clustering of each firm's drilling licenses both reduces the incentive to free ride and increases the speed of learning.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33067,33067,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024
Retirement Incentives and Decisions across the Income Distribution: Evidence in Canada,Kevin S. Milligan & Tammy Schirle,"We evaluate the retirement incentives embedded in Canada’s retirement income system with attention to where individuals are located in the income distribution. We find that larger social security benefits are available to individuals with lower earnings in their work history because of the benefit income tests, but those from the top of the income distribution tend to enjoy longer lives over which they may receive benefits. Overall, we see greater Social Security Wealth among individuals from lower deciles. The implicit tax rates on continued work tend to be higher for workers from lower-earning deciles. Considering changes to actuarial adjustments associated with early pension take up, these implicit tax rates on work at older ages fell substantially after 2011. Our regression estimates confirm the importance of incentives on retirement behavior, with substantially larger effects for individuals in lower deciles. These effects are greater for women than men. In simulations, we show that changes to the actuarial adjustment had some impact on retirement rates by lowering the implicit tax on work. The overall redistributive effect of these induced retirement changes was fairly small, however, as the actuarial adjustments brought the system closer to actuarial fairness.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33069,33069,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024
Overcoming Discrimination: Harassment and Discrimination Dynamics,"Yi Chen, Adam Dearing & Michael Waldman","A common feature of historical episodes in which integration was successful, as well as episodes where integration was unsuccessful, is the aggravated harassment of the early pathbreakers who put themselves at risk by violating the previous segregated norm. Examples abound including Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby in the case of Major League Baseball, Autherine Lucy who was the first Black student at the University of Alabama, and Jane Chastain and Melissa Ludtke who were early female sports reporters. In this paper, we explore from a theoretical perspective the role of harassment of what we refer to as integration pathbreakers in the success and speed with which integration occurs. In our model of labor market discrimination, harassment occurs because the harassers receive direct and immediate utility from harassing, but also because harassment has the potential to slow down or even stop integration. Our main result is that such a setting can exhibit path dependence, where the success or failure of the early integration pathbreakers can be pivotal for the success and speed of the subsequent integration process. That is, early success is more likely to be followed by successful and faster integration than early failure, even when the early success is not due to aspects of the environment that make integration easier. In addition to our formal theoretical analysis of the role of harassment in the success and speed of integration, we apply our results to various historical episodes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33065,33065,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024
Feeding the Tigers: Remittances and Conflict in Sri Lanka,"Barthélémy Bonadio, Andrei A.

We develop an approach to infer which remittance inflows were likely to benefit the Tamil Tiger rebels relative to the central government based on Facebook connections data at the subnational level. Using shocks to source country remittance outflows, we show that exogenous increases in remittances accessible to the Tamil Tigers significantly increased their fighting strength. We then set up a quantitative model of two-sided armed conflict over many contested geographic locations, augmented with remittance flows that affect the fighting strengths of the two sides. We structurally estimate the key parameters using remittance and conflict data, and calibrate the model to the Sri Lankan subdistricts over the period of the conflict. Our main quantitative finding is that remittances had a significant impact on the timing of the central government victory, and were a substantially more important component of the military strength of the Tamil Tigers than of the government. Remittances that favored the Tamil Tiger rebels may have prolonged the war by as much as 14 years.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33062,33062,October 2024,NBER,10/21/2024

Our baseline calibration suggests that a 50% reduction in imports of FCIs from China and other countries with similar geopolitical orientations would result in sizable losses of value added with significant heterogeneity across firms, sectors, regions and countries, driven by the heterogeneous exposure of firms.

Government-guaranteed credit and populism,"Ernest Dautović, Robin Hsieh","The phenomenon of political populism and its financial determinants have proved elusive. We utilise the sudden and uneven change in credit conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented government credit guarantee programme in France to investigate whether liquidity support to firms affects political preferences. Drawing on credit registry data – which provides the universe of loans and credit lines to firms – we build a postcode-municipality-level dataset and show that government-guaranteed credit reduced the support for the far right but increased it for the incumbent. The underlying economic channel shows that credit guarantees preserved employment, which in turn influenced political preferences.

Drawing on regulatory data analysis, recent research, and experiences with fixed income market functioning, we focus on two types of constraints that are most relevant for dealers’ intermediation activities: regulatory constraints—specifically the minimum Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) requirement at the Bank Holding Company (BHC) level—and internal risk limits—specifically Value at Risk (VaR) limits at the trading-desk level for each dealer.",https://www.federalreserve.gov//econres/notes/feds-notes/assessment-of-dealer-capacity-to-intermediate-in-treasury-and-agency-mbs-markets-20241022.html,1017016238071723610,"October 22, 2024",FED-BOARD-NOTES,10/23/2024
A statistical approach to identifying ECB monetary policy,"Lea Bitter, Claus Brand, Luís Fonseca, Yıldız Akkaya","We construct monetary policy indicators from high-frequency asset price changes following policy announcements, emphasising the concentration of asset price responses along specific dimensions and their leptokurtic distribution. Traditionally, these dimensions are identified by rotating principal components based on economic assumptions that overlook information in excess kurtosis. We employ Varimax rotation, leveraging excess kurtosis without using economic restrictions. Within a set of euro-area risk-free assets Varimax validates policy news along dimensions previously derived from structural identification approaches and rejects evidence of macroinformation shocks. Yet, once adding risky assets Varimax identifies only one risk-free factor in medium- to long-term yields and instead points to additional risk-shift factors.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2994~6c2bcefa86.en.pdf?44e0a01bf3b221f8ba438c71caf12694,2994,23 October 2024,ECB,10/23/2024

Extend-and-Pretend in the U.S. CRE Market,Matteo Crosignani and Saketh Prazad,"We show that banks “extended-and-pretended” their impaired CRE mortgages in the post-pandemic period to avoid writing off their capital, leading to credit misallocation and a buildup of financial fragility. We detect this behavior using loan-level supervisory data on maturity extensions, bank assessment of credit risk, and realized defaults for loans to property owners and REITs. Extend-and-pretend crowds out new credit provision, leading to a 4.8–5.3 percent drop in CRE mortgage origination since 2022:Q1 and fuels the amount of CRE mortgages maturing in the near term. As of 2023:Q4, this “maturity wall” represents 27 percent of bank capital.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1130,1130,2024-10-19,FED-NEWYORK,10/24/2024
A Simple Diagnostic for Time-Series and Panel-Data Regressions,"Richard K.

The diagnostic is built on the novel result that the eigenvectors of a random walk asymptotically orthogonalize a wide variety of time-series processes. Our diagnostic is based on leave-one-out OLS estimation on transformed variables using these eigenvectors. We illustrate how our diagnostic allows applied researchers to scrutinize regression results and probe for underlying fragility of the sample OLS estimate.

Financial Education and Household Financial Decisions During the Pandemic,"Donghoon Lee, Daniel Mangrum, Wilbert  van der Klaauw, and Crystal Wang","We examine the impact of financial education on credit decisions during COVID-19. The pandemic presented economic challenges, but policy responses provided opportunities for savvy borrowers. Using variation in state-mandated financial education during high school, we find that mandated borrowers reduced their credit card balances by larger amounts after stimulus checks were distributed and were more likely to buy homes and to refinance mortgages at low rates during the pandemic. The larger credit card balance reduction was driven by middle-income areas and subprime borrowers, while prime borrowers drove mortgage refinancing.

Reservation Wages Revisited: Empirics with the Canonical Model,"Steven J. Davis, Pawel M. Krolikowski","Using innovative longitudinal data from a survey of unemployment insurance (UI) recipients, we test several implications of a canonical job search model for reservation wages during unemployment spells. First, consistent with the model, we find that reservation wages fall faster when UI benefit durations are shorter. However, workers set their initial reservation wages higher, and adjust them slower, relative to model predictions. Second, workers' expectations—elicited at the beginning of their unemployment spell—about how their reservation wage will evolve if they remain unemployed are largely congruent with reservation wage realizations, as assumed in the canonical model. Third, our data on expectations and realizations suggest that dynamic selection over the unemployment spell is inconsequential for our results. Fourth, higher wages on workers' lost jobs, relative to predictions from a Mincerian wage regression, hasten the expected and realized declines in reservation wages over the unemployment spell. Finally, reservation wages are a more powerful predictor of re-employment wages than wages on the previous job.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2423-reservation-wages-revisited-empirics-with-canonical-model,24-23,10.24.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,10/25/2024

A Currency Premium Puzzle,"Tarek A. Hassan, Thomas Mertens, Jingye Wang","Standard asset pricing models reconcile high equity premia with smooth risk-free rates by inducing an inverse functional relationship between the mean and the variance of the stochastic discount factor. This highly successful resolution to closed-economy asset pricing puzzles is fundamentally problematic when applied to open economies: It requires that differences in currency returns arise almost exclusively from predictable appreciations, not from interest rate differentials. In the data, by contrast, exchange rates are largely unpredictable, and currency returns arise from persistent interest rate differentials. We show currency risk premia arising in canonical long-run risk and habit preferences cannot match this fact. We argue this tension between canonical asset pricing and international macroeconomic models is a key reason researchers have struggled to reconcile the observed behavior of exchange rates, interest rates, and capital flows across countries. The lack of such a unifying model is a major impediment to understanding the effect of risk premia on international markets.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/10/a-currency-premium-puzzle,2024-32,2024-10-24,FED-SANFRANCISCO,10/25/2024

How Should Monetary Policy Respond to Housing Inflation?,"Javier Bianchi, Alisdair McKay, Neil Mehrotra","A persistent rise in rents has kept inflation above target in many advanced economies. Optimal policy in the standard New Keynesian (NK) model requires policy to stabilize housing inflation. We argue that the basic architecture of the NK model—that excess demand is always satisfied by producers—is inappropriate for the housing market, and we develop a matching framework that allows for demand rationing. Our findings indicate that the optimal response to a housing demand shock is to stabilize inflation in the non-housing sector while disregarding housing inflation. Our results hold exactly in a version of the model with costless search and quantitatively in a version with housing search costs calibrated to match US data on housing tenure, vacancy rates, and the size of the real estate sector.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/working-papers/how-should-monetary-policy-respond-to-housing-inflation,808,"October 24, 2024",FED-MINNEAPOLIS,10/26/2024
What Imports to Import Prices?,Enrique Martínez García and Braden W.

Focusing on the largest U.S. trading partners, our analysis shows that ERPT is more muted than previously estimated, with freight costs having no measurable impact on import prices and foreign production costs exerting only limited influence. We also observe significant heterogeneity in countries’ short-run responses, shaped by differences in trade composition and pricing strategies. Consistent estimates across common dynamic panel estimators underscore the robustness of these findings. The results suggest that exchange rate fluctuations may have a weaker direct effect on U.S. inflation than earlier studies implied, underscoring the need to reconsider current models of pricing behavior and inflation dynamics.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2410.pdf,2410,"October 23, 2024",FED-DALLAS,10/26/2024
Inflation in Disaggregated Small Open Economies,Alvaro Silva,"This paper studies inflation in small open economies with production networks. I show that production networks alter the elasticity of the consumer price index (CPI) to changes in sectoral technology, factor prices, and import prices. Sectors can import and export directly but also indirectly through domestic intermediate inputs. Indirect exporting dampens the inflationary pressure from domestic forces, while indirect importing increases the inflation sensitivity to import price changes. Computing these CPI elasticities requires knowledge of the production network structure because these do not coincide with typical sufficient statistics used in the literature such as sectoral sales-to-GDP ratios, factor shares, or imported consumption shares. Using input-output tables, I provide empirical evidence that adjusting CPI elasticities for indirect exports and imports matters quantitatively for small open economies. I use the model to illustrate the importance of production networks during the COVID-19–related inflation in Chile and the United Kingdom.",https://www.bostonfed.org//publications/research-department-working-paper/2024/inflation-in-disaggregated-small-open-economies,24-12,2024-10-25,FED-BOSTON,10/26/2024
The Effects of a Statewide Ban on School Suspensions,"Jane Arnold Lincove, Catherine Mata & Kalena Cortes","This research analyzes the implementation of a school suspension ban in Maryland to investigate whether a top-down state-initiated ban on suspensions in early primary grades can influence school behavior regarding school discipline. Beginning in the fall of 2017, the State of Maryland banned the use of out-of-school suspensions for grades PK-2, unless a student posed an “imminent threat” to staff or students. This research investigates (1) what was the effect of the ban on discipline outcomes for students in both treated grades and upper elementary grades not subject to the ban? (2) did schools bypass the ban by coding more events as threatening or increasing the use of in-school suspensions? and (3) were there differential effects for students in groups that are historically suspended more often? Using a comparative interrupted time series strategy, we find that the ban is associated with a substantial reduction in, but not a total elimination of, out-of-school suspensions for targeted grades without substitution of in-school suspensions. Disproportionalities by race and other characteristics remain after the ban. Grades not subject to the ban experienced few effects, suggesting the ban did not trigger a schoolwide response that reduced exclusionary discipline.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33086,33086,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
Firm-to-Firm Referrals,"Jing Cai, Wei Lin & Adam Szeidl","We make randomized firm-to-firm referrals between 700 supplier and client firms in the industry producing the Chinese writing brush.

The referrals increase revenue, profit, and hours worked in supplier firms and growth-oriented client firms. Treated suppliers increase product quality, while treated clients expand product variety into higher-quality products, suggesting that the referrals enable complementary upgrading. Treated firms increase beliefs about the value of partners, search for partners, and the number of non-referred partners, suggesting that pessimistic beliefs is a key partnering friction.

Are Community College Students Increasingly Choosing High-Paying Fields of Study? Evidence from Massachusetts,"Richard J. Murnane, John B. Willett, Aubrey McDonough, John P. Papay & Ann J. Mantil","The labor-market payoff to workers with associate degrees in healthcare and STEM occupations is very high in Massachusetts. We examine whether this induced a growing proportion of students in MA community colleges (MACCs) to earn an associate degree (AD) in one of these fields. We do this by using multinomial logit analysis to compare trends across 12 cohorts of MACC entrants in the proportion of students who earned an AD in a healthcare or STEM program within six years of entry.
We find a substantial increase across cohorts in the proportion of students who earned an AD in a STEM program, but not in the proportion who earned an AD in a healthcare program. We found differences in degree attainment by student gender, race/ethnicity, family income, and 10th-grade mathematics score. Interviews with MACC program leaders revealed that supply constraints hinder expansion of many healthcare AD programs, but not STEM programs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33073,33073,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
Distance to Opportunity: Higher Education Deserts and College Enrollment Choices,"Riley K. Acton, Kalena Cortes & Camila Morales","We study how geographic access to public postsecondary institutions is associated with students’ college enrollment decisions across race and socioeconomic status. Leveraging rich administrative data, we first document substantial differences in students’ local college options, with White, Hispanic, and rural students having, on average, many fewer nearby options than their Black, Asian, suburban, and urban peers. We then show that students are sensitive to the distance they must travel to access public colleges and universities, but there are heterogeneous effects across students. In particular, we find that White and non-economically disadvantaged students respond to living far from public two-year colleges primarily by enrolling in four-year colleges, whereas Black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students respond primarily by forgoing college enrollment altogether. Lastly, in a series of decomposition and simulation exercises to inform public policy efforts to increase college enrollment, especially among underrepresented minorities and low-income students, we find that differences in students’ sensitivity to distance, rather than differences in distance to the nearest college, primarily contribute to observed four-year college enrollment gaps across racial and ethnic groups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33085,33085,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024

I estimate willingness-to-pay for a rich set of compensation elements and working conditions. Highly effective teachers usually have the same preferences as their peers, but they have stronger preferences for performance pay. I use the preference estimates to investigate the optimal compensation structure for three key objectives: maximizing teacher utility, maximizing teacher retention, and maximizing student achievement. Under each objective, schools underutilize salary and performance pay, while overutilizing retirement benefits. Restructuring compensation can significantly improve both teacher welfare and student achievement.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33088,33088,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
Revisiting the Phillips and Beveridge Curves: Insights from the 2020s Inflation Surge,Pierpaolo Benigno & Gauti B. Eggertsson,"This paper reexamines the Phillips and Beveridge curves to explain the inflation surge in the U.S. during the 2020s. We argue that the pre-surge consensus regarding both curves requires substantial revision. We propose that the Inverse-L (INV-L) New Keynesian Phillips Curve replace the standard New Keynesian Phillips Curve. The INV-L curve is piecewise-linear and more sensitive to labor market conditions when it crosses the Beveridge threshold — a point at which the labor market becomes excessively tight and enters a ""labor shortage"" regime. We introduce a modified Beveridge curve that features a near-vertical slope once the Beveridge threshold is passed, suggesting that in this region, adjustment in labor market tightness occurs almost exclusively through a drop in vacancies rather than an increase in unemployment. This feature matches the U.S. experience since the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle began in March 2022. We also observe a similar pattern in the data during five other inflation surges over the past 111 years where the Beveridge threshold was breached. We define a Beveridge-threshold (BT) unemployment rate. Once unemployment falls below this rate, policymakers must be alert to sharp inflationary pressures from demand or supply shocks. We explore several policy implications.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33095,33095,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
Empirical Bayes Methods in Labor Economics,Christopher R. Walters,"Labor economists increasingly work in empirical contexts with large numbers of unit-specific parameters. These settings include a growing number of value-added studies measuring causal effects of individual units like firms, managers, neighborhoods, teachers, schools, doctors, hospitals, police officers, and judges.

Service Quality on Online Platforms: Empirical Evidence about Driving Quality at Uber,"Susan Athey, Juan Camilo Castillo & Bharat Chandar","Online marketplaces have adopted new quality control mechanisms that can accommodate a flexible pool of providers. In the context of ride-hailing, we measure the effectiveness of these mechanisms, which include ratings, incentives, and behavioral nudges. Using telemetry data as an objective measure of quality, we find that drivers not only respond to user preferences but also improve their behavior after receiving warnings about their low ratings. Furthermore, we use data from a randomized experiment to show that informing drivers about their past behavior improves quality, especially for low-performing drivers. Lastly, we find that UberX drivers exhibit behavior comparable to that of UberTaxi drivers, suggesting that Uber’s new quality control mechanisms successfully maintain a high level of service quality.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33087,33087,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
"Welfare Effects of a Permanent Unconditional Cash Transfer Program: Evidence from Maricá, Brazil","Sidhya Balakrishnan, Roberta Costa, Johannes Haushofer & Fábio Waltenberg","We investigate the impact of a permanent unconditional cash transfer called “Citizen’s Basic Income” in the city of Maricá, Brazil. At the time of the study, the program made monthly household-level transfers of USD 180 PPP on average to about a fourth of the city’s residents. The program is unique in that it is both unconditional and permanent, while existing programs typically only have one of these features. Between September 2021 and April 2022, we surveyed 5,182 individuals, about half of whom received the RBC. We use propensity score matching with inverse probability weights to create a matched comparison group and estimate the effect of the program on economic, social, and psychological outcomes. Our results reveal several positive welfare effects. Household income including transfers increased by 9%; consumption at the per capita level did not change significantly, but the household as a whole experienced a consumption increase of 5%. We also observe improvements in an index of children’s health and education, although the effect does not survive multiple inference correction and bounding. There was a notable displacement of other income sources, particularly labor income, which decreased by 17% among recipients, suggesting shifts to lower-paying but potentially more desirable jobs during the pandemic. The program also led to increased access to financial services, but decreased the propensity to save. These findings paint a nuanced picture of the socioeconomic benefits of unconditional cash transfers and established cash transfer administrative systems.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33089,33089,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024

Perceived Political Bias of the Federal Reserve,"Pei Kuang, Michael Weber & Shihan Xie","We conduct a survey experiment with a large, politically representative sample of U.S. consumers (5,205 participants) to study how perceptions of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s (Fed) political stance shape macroeconomic expectations and trust in the Fed. The public is divided on the Fed’s political leaning: most Republican-leaning consumers believe the Fed favors Democrats, whereas most Democrat-leaning consumers perceive the Fed as favoring Republicans. Consumers who perceive the Fed as aligned with their political affiliations tend to (1) have a more positive outlook on current and future economic conditions and express higher trust in the institution, (2) show greater willingness to pay for and are more likely to receive Fed communications, and (3) assign significantly more weight to Fed communications when updating their inflation expectations. Strong in-group favoritism generally amplifies these effects. Finally, if Trump were elected U.S. president, consumers would overwhelmingly view the Fed as favoring Republicans. The proportion of consumers viewing the Fed as an in-group would remain stable, but its composition would shift: Democrat-leaning consumers would see the Fed as less of an in-group, whereas more Republican-leaning consumers would perceive it in this way. Likewise, overall public trust in the Fed would remain steady, but trust among Democrat-leaning consumers would decline significantly, whereas it would rise among Republican-leaning consumers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33071,33071,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024

Additionally, the higher the fraction of the population that were slaves in a cadet’s home state the lower the likelihood that the cadet joined the Union and the lower the peer influence.

The Long-Run Impacts of Regulated Price Cuts: Evidence from Medicare,Yunan Ji & Parker Rogers,"We investigate the effects of substantial Medicare price reductions in the medical device industry, which amounted to a 61% decrease over 10 years for certain device types. Analyzing over 20 years of administrative and proprietary data, we find these price cuts led to a 25% decline in new product introductions and a 75% decrease in patent filings, indicating significant reductions in innovation activity. Manufacturers decreased market entry and increased outsourcing to foreign producers, associated with higher rates of product defects. Our calculations suggest the value of lost innovation may fully offset the direct cost savings from the price cuts. We propose that better-targeted pricing reforms could mitigate these negative effects. These findings underscore the need to balance cost containment with incentives for innovation and quality in policy design.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33083,33083,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024

Specifically, we combine variation in UberX entry across the U.S. with the Treatment Episode Data Set to estimate the effect of ridesharing on admissions to substance use disorder treatment. People needing such treatment report transportation as a barrier to receiving care. We find that UberX entry into a Core Based Statistical Area has no effect on the overall number of treatment admissions. However, we find a decline in non-intensive outpatient treatment which is fully offset by an increase in intensive outpatient treatment. Given the required relative frequency of non-intensive and intensive outpatient treatment in terms of visits per week, our findings indicate that UberX helps to reduce transportation barriers to accessing healthcare. Event-studies show parallel trends in outcomes before UberX entry and results are robust to numerous sensitivity checks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33077,33077,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
The Health and Employment Effects of Employer Vaccination Mandates,"Ashvin Gandhi, Ian Larkin, Brian McGarry, Katherine Wen, Huizi Yu, Sarah Berry, Vincent Mor, Maggie Syme & Elizabeth White","Health care facilities considering mandating staff vaccination face a difficult tradeoff. While additional vaccination coverage will directly reduce disease transmission within the facility, the imposition of a mandate may also cause vaccine-hesitant staff to quit, which could harm patient care. To study this tradeoff, we leverage comprehensive administrative data covering virtually all US nursing homes, including payroll-based records on approximately 500 million daily nurse shifts and weekly data on COVID transmission and mortality at each facility. We use a difference-in-differences framework to estimate the impact of employer-imposed vaccine mandates at 581 nursing homes on disease spread, employment outcomes, and several patient care metrics. While mandates did slightly increase staff turnover, the effects were concentrated on staff working less than 20 hours per week, and resulted in a reduction of less than two minutes per patient-day. Furthermore, there is only limited evidence of lower levels of care at mandate facilities in typically-monitored conditions such as patient falls, pressure ulcers, or urinary tract infections. In contrast, implementing a vaccine mandate led to large increases in staff vaccinations at mandate facilities, which directly led to less transmission of and lower patient mortality from COVID. We estimate that vaccine mandates saved one patient life for every two facilities that enacted a mandate, a large effect given the typical facility has around 100 beds. Our results suggest that the health benefits of mandates far outweigh the costs in terms of reduced patient care from staff turnover.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33072,33072,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
Firm Wage Effects,Patrick M. Kline,"This paper reviews the literature on firm wage differences and the fixed effects methods typically used to measure these differences. High wage firms tend to be more productive, larger, more sought after by workers, and to employ more credentialed and higher wage workers. The latest evidence suggests high wage firms also tend to offer better amenities and are prone to outsourcing and mass layoffs. Reviewing the requirements of the “AKM model” of Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999), I provide a graph theoretic interpretation of the restrictions this model places on the wage changes of workers who switch employers and examine the extent to which they are satisfied in a benchmark dataset. Assumptions are provided that give these wage changes a causal interpretation and I discuss some difficulties that arise in aggregating them into a global ranking of firm wage levels. In reviewing the econometrics of variance decompositions, I argue that attention ought to focus on effect sizes rather than variance shares, which can be difficult to compare across datasets with different noise levels. Cross-fitting and clustering methods for addressing limited mobility bias are reviewed. A series of bounding and imputation exercises suggest the network pruning typically used in conjunction with cross-fitting methods has little effect on estimands of interest. A review of the latest international evidence finds that the bias corrected standard deviation of firm effects tends to be substantially elevated in less developed countries. Variance estimation methods for second step regressions of firm effects on covariates are reviewed and illustrated with an empirical application to the firm size wage premium. Finally, I discuss connections between the AKM model and the celebrated sequential auction framework of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002), concluding with some areas for future work at this intersection.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33084,33084,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
The Distaste for Housing Density,Joseph Gyourko & Sean E. McCulloch,"We characterize the distribution of suburban homeowners’ preferences for housing unit density. To measure welfare changes under counterfactual increases in density, we first construct a novel house-level measure of exposure to density and identify its price effects in a boundary discontinuity design. On the borders of municipalities with larger minimum lot sizes, lots are 3,000 ft² larger and houses are $40,000 costlier. We exploit the systematic variation in density exposure induced by these discontinuities to estimate price effects. We then connect these estimates to a structural hedonic model of housing choice to retrieve individuals’ preferences for density. Overall, we find an average welfare loss among incumbent homeowners from a 1/2 unit per acre increase in density (which is equivalent to a 0.3 standard deviation in density) of about $9,500, with significantly larger losses under counterfactual increases solely from rental units. There is other noteworthy heterogeneity in these preferences, too. Most households have only a moderate preference over density. The median welfare loss is only 55% of the average, implying a long, left tail of those with more extreme aversions to density. This tail disproportionately contains households in affluent, low density neighborhoods. In sum, our results document an important foundation of the demand for density regulation across U.S. suburbs that we hope serves as a valuable input into future research into the considerable costs of that policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33078,33078,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
Firm Climate Investment: A Glass Half-Full,"Prachi Srivastava, Nicholas Bloom, Philip Bunn, Paul Mizen, Gregory Thwaites & Ivan Yotzov","We analyse the importance of climate-related investment using a large economy-wide survey of UK firms. Over half of firms expect climate change to have a positive impact on their investment in the medium term, with around a quarter expecting a large impact of over 10%. Around two-thirds of these investments are expected to be in addition to normal capital expenditure, with some firms investing less elsewhere. These investments will be driven by larger firms as well as those in more energy-intensive sectors. Climate investments are expected mainly in switching to green energy sources and improving energy efficiency, and firms expect to finance these mainly using internal cash reserves. Overall, although firms are expecting to invest more resources in adapting to climate change, under reasonable assumptions, these investments are still not sufficient to meet the estimated targets implied by the UK Net Zero Pathway.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33081,33081,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
Tyranny of the Personal Network: The Limits of Arm’s Length Fundraising in Venture Capital,"Sabrina T. Howell, Dean Parker & Ting Xu","The central tension in securities regulation is between protecting investors and enabling broad capital formation. Focusing on VC fund managers, we study key tools of investor protection in private markets: enforcing relationship-based fundraising and restricting eligible investors. A new policy permitting public advertising is disproportionately used by less well-networked, underrepresented fund managers and is less sensitive to local conditions. Yet it has limited take-up because track record matters at arm’s length while strong networks matter in relationship financing; underrepresented managers more often have neither. Arm’s length fundraising also imposes costs to accessing the “crowd” and verifying investors, inducing negative signaling.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33080,33080,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
Rethinking Short-Term Real Interest Rates and Term Spreads Using Very Long-Run Data,"Kenneth S. Rogoff, Barbara Rossi & Paul Schmelzing","Utilizing critical recent data advances, we analyze empirical evidence on long-run samples of short-maturity real interest rates as well as term spreads based on multi-century data. In contrast to an extensive literature on short-maturity real interest rates over the past few decades, we find strong and consistent evidence of trend stationarity in long horizon series, relatively fast adjustment speeds, and a paucity of structural breaks – results that we show to survive out of sample tests. The use of very long-run data offers a fresh perspective for ongoing monetary policy debates surrounding r*, and also provides a crucial missing link to reconstructing the long-run properties of term spreads. On balance and against limited post-COVID data, our evidence suggests caution on the idea of a break in short-term real interest rate behavior and instead points to elements of continuity over very long time periods. Relatedly, we show that term spreads are secularly rising while inflation volatility trends in the exact opposite direction – a finding questioning the emphasis of influential term structure models.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33079,33079,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
Marine Microplastics and Infant Health,"Xinming Du, Shan Zhang & Eric Zou","A century of plastic usage has led to an accumulation of plastic waste in waterways and oceans. Over time, these wastes break down into particles smaller than 5 microns – or “microplastics” – which can infiltrate human biological systems. Despite decades of research into this emerging source of pollution, there is a paucity of direct evidence on the health impacts of microplastics exposure at a population scale. This paper reports the first empirical link between in-utero microplastic exposure and adverse birth outcomes. Our analysis is based on a dataset of 3 million births that occurred in coastal areas of 15 countries spanning four continents, which we merge with novel remote-sensing measurements of marine microplastic concentrations. We show that in-utero exposure to microplastics, particularly during the second and third trimesters, leads to a significant increase in the likelihood of low birth weight. A doubling of exposure increases low birth weight hazard by 0.37 per 1,000 births, which implies that over 205,000 cases per year globally can be attributed to microplastic exposure. We further show that aerosolization – whereby microplastic particles become airborne and inhalable due to seawater evaporation – is an important pathway for health impact, a challenge likely to escalate as ocean temperatures rise.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33094,33094,October 2024,NBER,10/28/2024
"Asymmetric monetary policy spillovers: the role of supply chains, credit networks and fear of floating","Jakub Mistak, F. Gulcin Ozkan","This paper examines the asymmetry in global spillovers from Fed policy across tightening versus easing episodes several examples of which have been on display since the global financial crisis (GFC). We build a dynamic general equilibrium model featuring: (i) occasionally binding collateral constraints in the financial sector with significant cross-border exposure; and (ii) global supply chains, allowing us to match the asymmetry of spillovers across contractionary versus expansionary monetary policy shocks. We find clear asymmetries in the transmission of US monetary policy, with significantly larger spillovers during contractionary episodes under both conventional and unconventional monetary policy changes. Our results also reveal that the greater the size of international credit and supply chain networks and the policymakers’ aversion to exchange rate fluctuations in the rest of the world, the greater the spillover effects of US monetary policy shocks.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2995~9e6ef7a352.en.pdf?5b3be487a389eaeaec37b093d25a520d,2995,29 October 2024,ECB,10/29/2024

One Threshold Doesn’t Fit All: Tailoring Machine Learning Predictions of Consumer Default for Lower-Income Areas,"Vitaly Meursault, Daniel Moulton, Larry Santucci, Nathan Schor","A previous version of this working paper was originally published in November 2022. Using credit bureau data and ML, we show that setting different lending thresholds for low and moderate income (LMI) neighborhoods relative to non-LMI neighborhoods can equalize the rate at which equally creditworthy borrowers receive credit. ML models alone better identify creditworthy individuals in all groups but remain more accurate for the majority group. A policy that equalizes access via separate thresholds imposes a cost on lenders, but this cost is outweighed by the substantial gains from ML. This approach aligns with the motivation behind existing laws such as the Community Reinvestment Act, which encourages lenders to meet the credit needs of underserved communities.

Willingness-To-Pay vs Administrative Hurdles: Understanding Barriers to Social Insurance Enrollment in Thailand,Benjamin A. Olken ⓡ Rema Hanna ⓡ Phitawat Poonpolkul ⓡ Nada Wasi,"Many government social insurance policies have low take-up. To understand whether this is due to administrative barriers, information, or low valuation of the insurance, we study an unusual policy experiment in Thailand that offered a very large lump-sum incentive for informal workers in selected provinces to enroll in a voluntary workers' social insurance program. Using administrative data, we find that the temporary enrollment incentive increased coverage by 67 percentage points—from 6 percent of informal workers to 73 percent -- within just a few months. However, 12 months later, only 13 percent of these new enrollees remained in the scheme, much lower than the retention rate of those who joined absent the incentive. By using new enrollees' choices among insurance tiers to back out a revealed valuation of insurance, we find that those who were induced to enroll by the incentives value insurance less than those who enrolled without. Combined, the results suggest that low social insurance enrollment may be the result of low ex-ante valuations of the insurance, rather than administrative barriers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33096,33096,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
Revisiting the Private Value of Scientific Inventions,"Ashish Arora, Sharon Belenzon, Elia Ferracuti & Jay Prakash Nagar","Estimating the private value of patents is important, yet challenging. By developing a method that uses stock market returns to produce a distribution of patent values (and not just an estimate of the mean of that distribution), Kogan, Papanikolaou, Seru, and Stoffman (2017) (KPSS) opened venues for new research. Researchers have used these estimates to compare average values of different types of patents. In this paper, we argue that KPSS values should not be used in their current form to compare mean values of different groups of patents, and show this to be the case in the context of research on the private returns to scientific patents. We extend the original KPSS method to allow for patents to be drawn from two distinct value distributions. Using this approach, we find that scientific patents have a higher mean value compared to non-scientific patents.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33056,33056,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
Unbalanced Trade: Is Growing Dispersion from Financial or Trade Reforms?,"George A.

We show that these two salient features—a rise in net and gross international trade—are largely a consequence of a reduction in intratemporal trade barriers rather than a substantial reduction in the frictions on intertemporal trade or greater asymmetries in business cycles. Beyond explaining changes in the distribution of gross and net trade, the decline in intratemporal trade frictions is consistent with a fall in the dispersion across countries in other key macro time series, including the real exchange rate, terms of trade, export-import ratio, relative spending, and relative GDP.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33101,33101,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024

Short-Time Work Extensions,"Christina Brinkmann, Simon Jäger, Moritz Kuhn, Farzad Saidi & Stefanie Wolter","Governments use short-time work (STW) schemes to subsidize job preservation during crises. We study the take-up of STW and its effects on worker outcomes and firm behavior using German administrative data from 2009 to 2021. Establishments utilizing STW tend to have higher wages, be larger, and have falling employment even before STW take-up. More adverse selection occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Within firms, STW is targeted towards workers likely to stay even in the absence of STW. To study the effects of STW, we examine two dimensions of policy variation: STW eligibility and extensions of potential benefit duration (PBD). Workers above retirement age, ineligible for STW, have identical employment trajectories compared to their slightly younger, eligible peers when their establishment takes up STW. A 2012 reform doubling PBD from 6 to 12 months did not secure employment at treated firms 12 months after take-up, with minimal heterogeneity across worker characteristics. However, treated and control firms experienced substantial and persistent differences in their wage trajectories, with control firms without extensions lowering wages compared to treated firms. Across cells, larger wage effects corresponded with smaller employment effects, consistent with downward wage flexibility preventing layoffs and substituting for the employment protection effects of STW. Our research designs reveal that STW extensions in Germany did not significantly improve short- or long-term employment outcomes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33112,33112,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
Current Account Dynamics and the Saving-Investment Nexus In a Changing and Uncertain World,Menzie D. Chinn & Hiro Ito,"We re‐examine the determinants of current account balances (CAB) and the saving-investment nexus with focus on emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). We are in a new age in terms of facing not just economic challenges but also other non-economic challenges such as global climate changes, increasing natural disasters, and wars. We face the need to reexamine the determinants of CAB along with national saving and investment. We first take an event study approach, examining how these variables have evolved historically in the wake of wars, natural disasters, and pandemics. The second is a cross‐country panel investigation of CAB, national saving, and of investment. In the presence of global financial instability, EMDEs tend to experience an improvement in CAB due to a fall in investment. A rise in oil prices increases both national saving and investment, but the change in investment is greater than the change in national saving, which worsens CAB.  Contractionary monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board tends to lower both national saving and investment, but the impact on CAB is not statistically different from zero. The more frequently a country experiences wars, on average, its CAB tends to improve. When a climatological or geographical disaster occurs, its CAB, national saving, and investment tend to improve. A rise in the level of U.S. monetary policy uncertainty leads to an improvement in CAB, mainly due to a fall in investment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33106,33106,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
Industry and Identity: The Migration Linkage Between Economic and Cultural Change in 19th Century Britain,Vasiliki Fouka & Theo Serlin,"How does economic modernization affect group identity? Modernization theory emphasizes how labor migration led to the adoption of common identities. Yet economic development may reduce incentives to emigrate, preserving local cultures. We study England and Wales during the Second Industrial Revolution, a period characterized by the development of new industries and declines in transportation and communication costs. Using microdata on individuals’ names and migration decisions, we quantify identity change and its variation across space. We develop and estimate a quantitative spatial model in which migration and cultural identities are inter-dependent. Different components of economic modernization had different effects on identity change. Falling migration costs homogenized peripheral regions. In contrast, industrial development led to heterogeneity, increasing the overall prevalence of the culture of London, while also creating local identity holdouts by reducing out-migration from industrializing peripheries. Modernization promotes both national identities and persistent local identities in peripheral regions that industrialize.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33114,33114,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
The Complexity of Economic Decisions,Xavier Gabaix & Thomas Graeber,"We propose a theory of the complexity of economic decisions. Leveraging a macroeconomic framework of production functions, we conceptualize the mind as a cognitive economy, where a task's complexity is determined by its composition of cognitive operations. Complexity emerges as the inverse of the total factor productivity of thinking about a task. It increases in the number of importance-weighted components and decreases in the degree to which the effect of one or few components on the optimal action dominates. Higher complexity generates larger decision errors and behavioral attenuation to variation in problem parameters. The model applies both to continuous and discrete choice. We develop a theory-guided experimental methodology for measuring subjective perceptions of complexity that is simple and portable. A series of experiments test and confirm the central predictions of our model for perceptions of complexity, behavioral attenuation, and decision errors. We provide a template for applying the framework to core economic decision domains, and then develop several applications including the complexity of static consumption choice with one or several interacting goods, consumption over time, the tax system, forecasting, and discrete choice between goods.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33109,33109,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
The China Shock Revisited: Job Reallocation and Industry Switching in U.S. Labor Markets,"Nicholas Bloom, Kyle Handley, André Kurmann & Philip A. Luck","Using confidential administrative data from the U.S. Census Bureau we revisit how the rise in Chinese import penetration has reshaped U.S. local labor markets. Local labor markets more exposed to the China shock experienced larger reallocation from manufacturing to services jobs. Most of this reallocation occurred within firms that simultaneously contracted manufacturing operations while expanding employment in services. Notably, about 40% of the manufacturing job loss effect is due to continuing establishments switching their primary activity from manufacturing to trade-related services such as research, management, and wholesale. The effects of Chinese import penetration vary by local labor market characteristics. In areas with high human capital, including much of the West Coast and large cities, job reallocation from manufacturing to services has been substantial. In areas with low human capital and a high initial manufacturing share, including much of the Midwest and the South, we find limited job reallocation. We estimate this differential response to the China shock accounts for half of the 1997-2007 job growth gap between these regions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33098,33098,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024

Drawing on a June 2023 Bundesbank household survey, we find that 69% of households report increased trust in the ECB due to its climate actions, valuing the institution's broader scope and concern. While 17% and 20% of households express concerns over risks to price stability or independence, 23% believe climate engagement reinforces the ECB's core objectives. An information intervention indicates minimal impact on household inflation expectations, suggesting a disconnect between institutional trust and inflation outlooks.

Following legalization, sports betting spreads quickly, with both the number of participants and frequency of bets increasing over time. This increase does not displace other gambling or consumption but significantly reduces savings, as risky bets crowd out positive expected value investments.

Did Tariffs Make American Manufacturing Great? New Evidence from the Gilded Age,Alexander Klein & Christopher M. Meissner,"We study the relationship between tariffs and labor productivity in US manufacturing between 1870 and 1909. Using highly dis-aggregated tariff data, state-industry data for the manufacturing sector, and an instrumental variable strategy, results show that tariffs reduced labor productivity. Tariffs also generally reduced the average size of establishments within an industry but raised output prices, value-added, gross output, employment, and the number of establishments. We also find evidence of heterogeneity in the association between tariffs and value added, gross output, employment, and establishments across groups of industries. We conclude that tariffs may have reduced labor productivity in manufacturing by weakening import competition and by inducing entry of smaller, less productive domestic firms. Our research also reveals that lobbying by powerful and productive industries may have been at play. The era’s high tariffs are unlikely to have helped the US become a globally competitive manufacturer.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33100,33100,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
Deficits and Inflation: HANK meets FTPL,"George-Marios Angeletos, Chen Lian & Christian K. Wolf","In HANK models, fiscal deficits drive aggregate demand and thus inflation because households are non-Ricardian; in the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL), they instead do so via equilibrium selection. Because of this difference, the mapping from deficits to inflation in HANK is robust to active monetary policy and free of the controversies surrounding the FTPL. Despite this difference, a benchmark HANK model with sufficiently slow fiscal adjustment predicts just as much inflation as the FTPL. This is true even in the simplest FTPL scenario, in which deficits are financed entirely by inflation and debt erosion. In practice, however, unfunded deficits are likely to trigger a persistent boom in real economic activity and thus the tax base, substituting for debt erosion. In our quantitative explorations, this reduces the inflationary effects of unfunded deficits by about half relative to that simple FTPL arithmetic.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33102,33102,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
Unwarranted Disparity in High-Stakes Decisions: Race Measurement and Policy Responses,"E. Jason Baron, Joseph J. Doyle Jr., Natalia Emanuel, Peter Hull & Joseph P. Ryan","Studies of racial discrimination often condition on endogenous measures of race or on earlier decisions that might themselves be affected by discrimination. We develop quasi-experimental tools for estimating the impact of racial misclassification on measures of unwarranted disparity, and for designing policy responses to unwarranted disparity that account for discrimination in earlier decisions. We apply these tools to the setting of child protective services (CPS), where previous work in our context has found that Black children are placed into foster care at higher rates than white children with identical potential for future maltreatment. CPS investigators misclassify 8–9% of Black and white children relative to their self-reported race, and this misclassification obscures around 24% of unwarranted disparity in foster care placement decisions. Policies that use algorithmic recommendations to eliminate total unwarranted disparity in placement rates are also meaningfully affected by earlier discrimination in CPS call screening.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33104,33104,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
Using Policy and Innovation to Improve Life-Saving Access to Naloxone,"Evan D. Peet, David Powell & Rosalie Liccardo Pacula","Naloxone is a life-saving medication which helps reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. Improving naloxone access is a central pillar of the federal response to the worsening opioid crisis in the United States. Existing studies have evaluated the effects of state naloxone access laws, including those that permit naloxone to be dispensed by pharmacies directly to consumers. However, this literature has ignored the role of pharmaceutical innovations like Narcan. Narcan, introduced to the marketplace in February 2016, is a naloxone nasal spray that permits laypersons to successfully administer the drug without training. We first test the hypothesis that naloxone access laws alone increased the distribution of naloxone prior to Narcan, followed by testing the hypothesis that the introduction of Narcan further expanded naloxone’s distribution and its life-saving impacts. We analyze cross-state variation in the adoption of naloxone access laws and their timing relative to Narcan’s introduction. We find that states with naloxone access laws permitting pharmacists to dispense to consumers experienced substantially greater naloxone dispensing after Narcan’s introduction, effects that far outpaced the independent effects of the laws themselves. We also find that while these naloxone access laws did not reduce non-synthetic opioid-related mortality rates on their own, once Narcan was introduced, these mortality rates significantly declined. These findings indicate the important interaction of innovation and policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33105,33105,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
Robots and Labor in Nursing Homes,"Yong Suk Lee, Toshiaki Iizuka & Karen Eggleston","How do employment, tasks, and productivity change with robot adoption? Unlike manufacturing, little is known about these issues in the service sector, where robot adoption is expanding. As a first step towards filling this gap, we study Japanese nursing homes using original facility-level panel data that includes the different robots used and the tasks performed. We find that robot adoption is accompanied by an increase in employment and retention and the relationship is strongest for non-regular care workers and monitoring robots. The share of specific tasks performed by robots increases with the adoption of the respective type of robot, leading to reallocation of care worker effort to “human touch” tasks that support quality care. Robots are associated with improved quality (reduction in restraint use and pressure ulcers) and productivity.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33116,33116,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
Taming the Curse of Dimensionality: Quantitative Economics with Deep Learning,"Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Galo Nuño & Jesse Perla","We argue that deep learning provides a promising avenue for taming the curse of dimensionality in quantitative economics. We begin by exploring the unique challenges posed by solving dynamic equilibrium models, especially the feedback loop between individual agents' decisions and the aggregate consistency conditions required by equilibrium. Following this, we introduce deep neural networks and demonstrate their application by solving the stochastic neoclassical growth model. Next, we compare deep neural networks with traditional solution methods in quantitative economics. We conclude with a survey of neural network applications in quantitative economics and offer reasons for cautious optimism.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33117,33117,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
The GDPR and SDK Usage In Android Mobile Apps,"Ginger Zhe Jin, Ziqiao Liu & Liad Wagman","Using data on Software Development Kits (SDKs), we study SDKs in Android apps vis-à-vis the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by the European Union in May 2018. Relative to US-only apps, the number of non-Google SDKs used per app in 5 major European countries (EU5) exhibits a 1.3% decline in EU5-only apps after GDPR, and a 6.3% decline in apps multihoming US and EU5. These effects are mostly driven by lower-ranked apps. Using apps’ monthly active users as weights in computing average user exposure to SDKs in app category and country groups, we find no significant change in the average SDK exposure in EU5-only relative to US-only apps. The only significant change in multihoming apps is a 4.2% drop in exposure to SDKs developed by minor SDK providers, although SDKs from Google and major SDK providers were independently assessed as riskier than those from minor SDK providers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33099,33099,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
The Mental Health of the Young in Latin America,David G. Blanchflower & Alex Bryson,"We examine the mental wellbeing of the young in 18 Latin American countries using data from five cross-country comparative studies plus cross-sectional and quarterly time series data for a single country, Mexico. We examine whether there has been a decline in youth mental health and, if so, whether it has removed the U-shape in happiness and the hump-shape in unhappiness in Latin America as it has done in the United States and elsewhere. In the Global Minds data, the mental health of the young is poorer than that of older age groups. The Enbiare surveys for Mexico indicate that declining wellbeing of the young has changed the age profile of (un)happiness in that country. The OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data show a decline in the mental health of school children in Latin America, and that mental ill-health is more pronounced among those who have early access to, or spend excessive time spent on, digital devices. However, in both the Gallup World Poll and the Latinobarometers the young remain happier than older age groups, even though the wellbeing of the young has declined in some Latin American countries. We speculate as to why there may be differences in trends across surveys.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33111,33111,November 2024,NBER,11/04/2024
Time-varying agglomeration economies and aggregate wage growth,"Clémence Berson, Pierre-Philippe Combes, Laurent Gobillon, Aurélie Sotura","We examine how agglomeration economies have influenced labour earnings in France over forty years. First, we define cities dynamically to account for their changing footprints. Our findings show that aggregate wage growth is mainly driven by growth in larger cities, rather than smaller ones or by population shifts across cities. We estimate individual wages incorporating time-varying city and individual fixed effects, and analyse how city characteristics (employment density, area, and market access) and their returns impact wage evolution. Changes in the values of these characteristics have minimal effect, but changes in their returns significantly influence wages, with notable variation across cities. Overall, aggregate wage growth in France reflects larger returns to larger city size. Our model, that incorporate the impact of agglomeration economies on city size and population, suggests that changes in returns do not drive population or area changes sufficiently to impact aggregate labour earnings, supporting our empirical findings.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2997~f4bb724a8d.en.pdf?d413e28657a1302af952818ec82bf55e,2997,7 November 2024,ECB,11/07/2024
Fiscal policy and inflation: accounting for non-linearities in government debt,"Cristina Checherita-Westphal, Tom Pesso","This paper investigates the interplay between discretionary fiscal policy and inflation in the euro area, emphasizing the role of public debt levels in modulating this relationship. It explores how fiscal expansions or contractions influence inflationary pressures, particularly under varying debt conditions. The analysis reveals that fiscal policy’s effect on inflation is non-linear, with debt levels significantly affecting the inflationary outcome of fiscal measures. High debt levels tend to amplify the inflation response to fiscal expansions, a finding that holds under multiple analytical frameworks and robustness checks. This paper contributes to the empirical literature by highlighting the critical role of fiscal policy, especially in high-debt environments, and its implications for inflation dynamics in the euro area.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2996~5e4df9c08d.en.pdf?c8c9bf62cfb1904c81c4375c95916841,2996,7 November 2024,ECB,11/07/2024
For whom the bill tolls: redistributive consequences of a monetary-fiscal stimulus,"Michał Brzoza-Brzezina, Marcin Kolasa, Krzysztof Makarski, Julia Jabłońska","During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in the euro area sharply increased spending while the European Central Bank eased financing conditions. We use this episode to assess how such a concerted monetary-fiscal stimulus redistributes welfare between various age cohorts. Our assessment involves not only the income side of household balance sheets (mainly direct effects of transfers) but also the more obscure financing side that, to a substantial degree, occurred via indirect effects (with a prominent role of the inflation tax). Using a quantitative life-cycle model, and assuming that the deficit was partly unfunded by future taxes, we document that young households benefited from the stimulus, while middle-aged and older agents mainly paid the bill. Crucially, most welfare redistribution was due to indirect effects related to macroeconomic adjustment that resulted from the stimulus. As a consequence, even though all age cohorts received significant transfers, the welfare of some actually decreased.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2998~fa7fd2487c.en.pdf?1b7a9aa8df85593fdc0fa7262aaac464,2998,8 November 2024,ECB,11/08/2024
"Financial returns, sentiment and market volatility. A dynamic assessment.","Stefano Borgioli, Giampiero M. Gallo, Chiara Ongari","In 1936, John Maynard Keynes proposed that emotions and instincts are pivotal in decision-making, particularly for investors. Both positive and negative moods can influence judgments and decisions, extending to economic and financial choices. Intuitions, emotional states, and biases significantly shape how people think and act. Measuring mood or sentiment is challenging, but surveys and data collection methods, such as confidence indices and consensus forecasts, offer some solutions. Recently, the availability of web data, including search engine queries and social media activity, has provided high-frequency sentiment measures. For example, the Italian National Statistical Institute’s Social Mood on Economy Index (SMEI) uses Twitter data to assess economic sentiment in Italy. The relationship between SMEI and financial market activity, specifically the FTSE MIB index and its volatility, is examined using a trivariate Vector Autoregressive model, taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2999~15454f4a4c.en.pdf?4abd2107f85529df0be2b5ffb108074e,2999,8 November 2024,ECB,11/08/2024

First, we document the evolution of interest for each actor individually, and then we provide a model of cross-influences between them. We estimate this model using a Vector Autoregression (VAR). We measure interest among the general public, the European Parliament, central banks, general interest science journals, and economics journals by creating a Climate Change Index (CCI) based on mentions of climate change in these domains. Except for general interest science journals, the index for all other domains has started showing significant values only recently, and it tends to fluctuate considerably.

Do Human Capital Adjustments Protect Youths from Structural Change?,Tucker Smith,"Structural changes to labor demand can have lasting consequences on the employment and earnings of workers in affected industries and geographies. However, individuals coming of age may avoid similar fates if they internalize salient changes to the returns to education and adjust their human capital investments. This paper studies the effects of exposure to structural labor demand shocks during youth and adolescence on human capital accumulation and later-life earnings. I use student-level administrative data from Texas and a modified difference-in-differences design that compares changes in outcomes across cohorts of students living in areas that were more or less exposed to Chinese import competition. Students exposed to larger shocks were 4% more likely to enroll in college and 8% more likely to earn a bachelor’s degree. I provide evidence that these adjustments, along with shifts of fields of study away from those directly exposed to import competition in both high school and college, shielded students from more than 90% of the shock’s negative effects on later-life earnings. My results contribute a silver lining to the gloomy findings of prior work on the long-term effects of “the China shock” and other negative labor demand shocks: if individuals coming of age sufficiently adjust their human capital investments, they can emerge relatively unscathed.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2411.pdf,2411,,FED-DALLAS,11/10/2024
"Monetary Policy Interactions: The Policy Rate, Asset Purchases and Optimal Policy with an Interest Rate Peg","Appendix
 

  Isabel Gödl-Hanisch, Ronald Mau and Jonathan Rawls","We study monetary policy in a New Keynesian model with a variable credit spread and scope for central bank asset purchases to matter. A novel financial and labor market interaction generates an endogenous cost-push channel in the Phillips curve and a credit wedge in the IS curve. These channels arise due to a liquidity premium to long-term debt present in our model. The “divine coincidence” holds with the nominal short rate and central bank balance sheet available as policy tools—dual-instrument policy. Targeting the liquidity premium using balance sheet policy provides a determinate equilibrium with a fixed policy rate, as does inflation-targeting balance sheet policy. While the liquidity premium in our model depends on unobservable components, the slope of the yield curve serves as a proxy for the liquidity premium when thinking about implementable monetary policy strategies that respond to observable variables alone. We quantify the welfare costs to various monetary policy strategies relative to the analytically derived optimal dual-instrument policy.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2412.pdf,2412,"October 31, 2024",FED-DALLAS,11/10/2024
"Small Changes, Big Impact: Nudging Employees Toward Sustainable Behaviors","Laura Cappellucci, Lan Ha, Jeremy Honig, Christopher R. Knittel, Amy Vetter & Richard Wilner","We designed and conducted three randomized control trials in partnership with a large biopharmaceutical company operating over 160 plasma donation centers, with the aim of promoting sustainable behaviors in a workplace setting. Specifically, we focused on reducing operational errors that led to dropped collection materials, long freezer door open times, and improper recycling practices. To achieve these goals, we employed social norms to nudge employees towards 1) reducing wasted collection materials, 2) minimizing the duration of freezer door openings, and 3) improving recycling practices. We found an average reduction of roughly 70 percent in plastic waste from dropped collection materials and the costs associated with these materials. The frequency of freezer door alarms decreased by over 80 percent, and the duration of alarms decreased by over 45 percent, depending on the empirical specification. We also observed a roughly 40 percent reduction in uncollapsed cardboard, with no statistically significant results for other types of contaminants. Importantly, for each of the interventions, we do not find evidence that the treatment effects waned over time or affected business operations. Our study provides significant implications for promoting sustainable behaviors in a workplace setting, filling an important gap in the literature on the effectiveness of nudges in the workplace.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33120,33120,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Randomized Entry,Francis Annan,"We study the direct and indirect effects of randomized entry. In partnership with the two largest service providers in Ghana, we implement a three-step design that randomizes the entry of new financial mobile money vendors, who also sell non-financial goods/services, across local markets. This mixed financial and non-financial services setting is widespread and naturally emerges as the market entry approach for several real-world financial markets. Randomized entry increases firm conduct and service quality and decreases price-cost markups, indicating positive consumer surplus. We find evidence of within-market revenue reallocation and expansion for mobile money and a large services multiplier: revenues for non-financial goods/services increased (+20%), with aggregate service industry revenues increasing. These improvements emphasize the “real effects” of financial markets on the local economy, and come from adoption externalities and aggregate increase in household expenses. Entry increases local economic activity, and it does so not only by changing markets for digital financial services, but also by transforming the non-financial services sector. These effects are key ingredients for advancing basic and applied knowledge on firm entry in industry equilibrium.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33134,33134,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Income Inequality and Job Creation,"Sebastian K. Doerr, Thomas Drechsel & Donggyu Lee","We propose a novel channel through which rising income inequality affects job creation and macroeconomic outcomes. High-income households save relatively more in stocks and bonds but less in bank deposits. A rising top income share thereby increases the relative financing cost for bank-dependent firms, which in turn create fewer jobs. Exploiting variation in top income shares across US states and an instrumental variable strategy, we provide evidence for this channel. We then build a general equilibrium macro model with heterogeneous households and heterogeneous firms and calibrate it to our empirical estimates. The model shows that the secular rise in top incomes accounts for 13% of the decline in the employment share of small firms since 1980. Through the new channel, rising inequality also reduces the labor share and aggregate output. Model experiments show that ignoring the link between inequality and job creation understates welfare effects of income redistribution.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33137,33137,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Central Bank Information or Neo-Fisher Effect?,Stephanie Schmitt-Grohé & Martín Uribe,"The neo-Fisher effect and the central bank information (CBI) effect produce similar outcomes: under both, a monetary tightening triggers an increase in inflation and an expansion in real activity. Separate estimates of these effects run the risk of confounding one with the other. To disentangle these two channels, we introduce into a new-Keynesian model a permanent monetary shock that generates neo-Fisher effects and an aggregate demand shock to which the central bank responds that creates CBI effects. We estimate the model on U.S. data. We find that the neo-Fisherian shock is an important driver of inflation, while the CBI shock explains a significant fraction of movements in the nominal interest rate. The CBI shock explains little of inflation and output, but, through counterfactual exercises, we establish that this reflects the central bank's success in isolating the economy from aggregate demand disturbances. These results are shown to hold under full and imperfect information.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33136,33136,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Nonlinear Pricing and Misallocation,Gideon Bornstein & Alessandra Peter,"This paper studies the effect of nonlinear pricing on markups and misallocation. We develop a general equilibrium model of firms that are allowed to set a quantity-dependent pricing schedule—contrary to the typical assumption in macroeconomic models. Without the restriction to linear pricing, markup heterogeneity is no longer a sign of misallocation. Larger firms charge higher markups, yet the allocation of resources across firms is efficient. Further, we point to a new source of misallocation. In general equilibrium, high-taste consumers are allocated too much of each good, low-taste consumers too little. When labor supply is elastic, firms’ market power depresses aggregate labor, but this effect is independent of the level of the aggregate markup in the economy. Using micro data from the retail sector, we show that nonlinear pricing is prevalent and quantify the model. We find that the welfare losses from misallocation across consumers under nonlinear pricing are substantially larger than those from misallocation across firms under linear pricing.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33144,33144,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
How the US-China Trade War Accelerated Urban Economic Growth and Environmental Progress in Northern Vietnam,"Matthew E.

Spatial Economics,Stephen J. Redding,"This paper reviews recent research in spatial economics. The field of spatial economics is concerned with the determinants and effects of the location of economic activity in geographic space. It analyses how geographical location shapes the economic activities performed by agents, their interactions with one another, their welfare, and the effects of public policy interventions. Research in this area has benefited from the simultaneous development of new theoretical techniques, new sources of geographic information systems (GIS) data, rapid advances in computing power, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and renewed public policy interest in infrastructure and appropriate policies towards places “left-behind” by globalization and technology. Among the insights from this research are the role of goods and commuting market access in determining location choices; the conditions under which the location of economic activity is characterized by multiple equilibria; the circumstances under which temporary shocks can have permanent effects (hysteresis or path dependence); the heterogeneous and persistent impact of local shocks; the magnitude and spatial decay of agglomeration economics; and the role of both agglomeration forces and endogenous changes in land use in shaping the impact of transport infrastructure improvements.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33125,33125,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Evaluating Minimum Taxation,James R. Hines Jr.,"Minimum tax rules constrain only the lowest-tax jurisdictions.  Because higher minimum tax rates expand the circle of affected countries and therefore the impact of any further changes, there can be dominated regions over which no parameter values would make a minimum tax efficient.  Applying a Taylor approximation to the distribution of statutory corporate tax rates in 2020, the range 4%-27% is a dominated region: there may be an efficient minimum rate below 4%, or higher than 27%, but there is no efficient world minimum tax rate between 4% and 27%.  Minimum taxes set at popular rates are particularly inefficient – a minimum tax rate of 15% yields value that, when positive, is equivalent to offsetting less than one percent of the effect of tax competition.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33140,33140,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Industrial Policies and Innovation: Evidence from the Global Automobile Industry,"Panle Jia Barwick, Hyuk-Soo Kwon, Shanjun Li, Yucheng Wang & Nahim B. Zahur","This paper examines the impact of industrial policies (IPs) on innovation in the global automobile industry. We compile the first comprehensive dataset linking global IPs with patent data related to the auto industry from 2008 to 2023. We document a major shift in policy focus: by 2022, nearly half of all IPs targeted electric vehicles (EV)-related sectors, up from almost none in 2008. In the meantime, there has been a clear technological transition from internal combustion engine (GV) technologies to EV innovations. Our analysis finds a positive relationship between policy support and innovation activity. At the country level, a one-standard-deviation increase in five-year cumulative EV-targeted IPs is associated with a four-percent rise in new EV patent applications. Firm-level analyses (using OLS, IV, and PPML) indicate that a ten-percent increase in EV financial incentives received by automakers and EV battery producers leads to a similar four-percent increase in EV innovations. We confirm the importance of path dependence in the direction of technology change in the automobile industry but find no evidence that EV-targeted IPs stimulate innovation in GV technologies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33138,33138,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
"Earnings, Marriage, and the Variance of Family Income by Age, Gender, and Cohort","Joseph Altonji, Daniel Giraldo Páez, Disa M. Hynsjö & Ivan Vidangos","For birth cohorts 1935–44, 1945–62, and 1964–74, we estimate the contribution of education; permanent heterogeneity in wage rates, employment, and hours; labor market shocks; spouse characteristics and shocks; nonlabor income shocks; and marital histories to the age profiles of the variance of family income per adult equivalent. The decompositions are based upon PSID data and Altonji, Giraldo-Páez, Hynsjö, and Vidangos’ (2024) statistical model of earnings, marriage, marital sorting, fertility, and nonlabor income. We find that education and employment heterogeneity are key sources of the rise in the variance with age and across birth cohorts. Hours shocks have grown in importance for women, and employment shocks have grown in importance, especially for men after age 30. The variance contribution of wage heterogeneity is substantial at all ages and has risen across cohorts for women.  Own characteristics and shocks matter more for men than women, while spouse characteristics and shocks matter more for women. Gender differences have declined across cohorts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33122,33122,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Quantitative Urban Economics,Stephen J. Redding,"This paper reviews recent quantitative urban models. These models are sufficiently rich to capture observed features of the data, such as many asymmetric locations and a rich geography of the transport network. Yet these models remain sufficiently tractable as to permit an analytical characterization of their theoretical properties. With only a small number of structural parameters (elasticities) to be estimated, they lend themselves to transparent identification. As they rationalize the observed spatial distribution of economic activity within cities, they can be used to undertake counterfactuals for the impact of empirically-realistic public-policy interventions on this observed distribution. Empirical applications include estimating the strength of agglomeration economies and evaluating the impact of transport infrastructure improvements (e.g., railroads, roads, Rapid Bus Transit Systems), zoning and land use regulations, place-based policies, and new technologies such as remote working.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33130,33130,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024

We find that government effectiveness and regulatory freedom positively correlate with pro-social behavior. We find that freedom from each of the following components of regulation; interest rate controls, binding minimum wages, worker dismissal protections, conscription, and administrative requirements; are correlated with prosocial behavior and are inversely correlated with Nash behavior.

"Tax Policy, Investment and Profit Shifting","Katarzyna A. Bilicka, Michael P.

We incorporate nonconvex costs of profit shifting and unobserved heterogeneity in profit-shifting ability in the MNEs' value maximization problem to study responses of firms to tax policies. We estimate our model using UK corporate tax returns data and quantify: (i) the elasticities of tax base and capital stock with respect to tax rates, (ii) the fixed and variable components of profit-shifting costs for different firm types, and (iii) the government's trade-off between raising tax revenue by reducing profit shifting and attracting investment. Accounting for extensive margin profit-reporting decisions, we reconcile most of the discrepancies between previous micro- and macro-level estimates of tax base elasticities. We test the predictions of the model using a quasi-natural experiment that restricted profit-shifting by Italian MNEs that operated in the UK and evaluate two types of tax policies that can be analyzed using our approach.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33132,33132,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Resolving Puzzles of Monetary Policy Transmission in Emerging Markets,"Jongrim Ha, Dohan Kim, M. Ayhan Kose & Eswar S.

We show that incorporating forward-looking expectations into standard open economy structural VAR models resolves these puzzles. Specifically, we augment the models with novel survey-based measures of expectations based on consumer, business, and professional forecasts. We find that the rise in prices following monetary tightening is related to currency depreciation, so eliminating the FX puzzle helps solve the price puzzle.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33133,33133,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
"Trade, Trees, and Lives","Xinming Du, Lei Li & Eric Zou","This paper shows a cascading mechanism through which international trade-induced deforestation results in a decline of health outcomes in cities distant from where trade activities occur. We examine Brazil, which has ramped up agricultural export over the last two decades to meet rising global demand. Using a shift-share research design, we first show that export shocks cause substantial local agricultural expansion and a virtual one-for-one decline in forest cover. We then construct a dynamic area-of-effect model that predicts where atmospheric changes should be felt – due to loss of forests that would otherwise serve to filter out and absorb air pollutants as they travel – downwind of the deforestation areas. Leveraging quasi-random variation in these atmospheric connections, we establish a causal link between deforestation upstream and subsequent rises in air pollution and premature deaths downstream, with the mortality effects predominantly driven by cardiovascular and respiratory causes. Our estimates reveal a large telecoupled health externality of trade deforestation: over 700,000 premature deaths in Brazil over the past two decades. This equates to $0.18 loss in statistical life value per $1 agricultural exports over the study period.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33143,33143,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024

Meissner & Kensuke Molnar-Tanaka,"Over the last 200 years, economies have accumulated significant experience in managing capital flows in the face of globalization. This study examines management of capital flows since the 1800s with an eye towards providing historical lessons for Southeast Asia today. We start with the global sterling/gold standard regime of the late 19th century globalization and then discuss the tumultuous inter-war period. We then examine policies in Southeast Asian countries since the 1950s. In the 1980s and 1990s, many economies faced increasing financial instability related to the resumption of global capital flows, most noticeably in Southeast Asia during the Asian Financial Crisis. The paper examines the historical importance of exchange rate policies for capital flow stability. Capital flow management in the 21st century faces various challenges such as enhanced state-intervention and digital currencies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33145,33145,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Information Span and Credit Market Competition,"Zhiguo He, Jing Huang & Cecilia Parlatore","We develop a credit market competition model that distinguishes between the information span (breadth) and signal precision (quality), capturing the emerging trend in fintech/non-bank lending where traditionally subjective (“soft”) information becomes more objective and concrete (“hard”). In a model with multidimensional fundamentals, two banks equipped with similar data processing systems possess hard signals about the borrower's hard fundamentals, and the specialized bank, who further interacts with the borrower, can also assess the borrower's soft fundamentals. Increasing the span of the hard information hardens soft information, enabling the data processing systems of both lenders to evaluate some of the borrower's soft fundamentals. We show that hardening soft information levels the playing field for the non-specialized bank by reducing its winner's curse. In contrast, increasing the precision or correlation of hard signals often strengthens the informational advantage of the specialized bank.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33141,33141,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Liquidity Shocks and Firm Exports: Evidence from Cash Shortages during India's Demonetization,"Ritam Chaurey, Ryan Kim & Pravin Krishna","This paper examines how liquidity shocks caused by currency shortages impact exports. We explore this in the context of India’s 2016 currency demonetization, a sudden and unexpected policy announcement by the government that large-denomination currency notes—comprising 86% of the country’s currency in circulation—would cease to be legal tender within hours. Our analysis uses novel data, including high-frequency customs transaction records matched with exporting firms and their balance sheets, as well as with inter-district domestic trade. We develop direct measures of exporting firms’ exposure to cash shortages and indirect measures that act through domestic supply chain networks. While the cash shortages do not directly affect exporting firms, we find a significant and immediate decline in real exports for firms whose domestic customers experience liquidity shocks. These findings underscore the critical role of domestic supply chains in transmitting liquidity shocks to exports.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33142,33142,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Education and Preferences for Desired Traits in Children,Naci H. Mocan & Nur Orak,"There is a strong correlation between the preferences and beliefs of parents and their children. Also, children of more educated parents tend to have different preferences and beliefs than those of less educated parents. However, evidence on whether education influences adults’ preferences regarding the attributes they wish to instill in children is missing. This paper seeks to fill that gap. Utilizing compulsory education reforms implemented in 19 European countries and data from the Integrated Values Survey—which includes questions about essential qualities children should be encouraged to learn at home—we demonstrate that women who acquired additional education due to these reforms are more likely to prioritize imagination, determination and perseverance, and a sense of responsibility as important traits to instill in children. Conversely, they are less inclined to regard religiosity, obedience, and unselfishness as essential attributes for children to learn at home. In addition, we find that education reduces women's religiosity. These effects are primarily driven by Catholic women and women living in majority-Catholic countries. In contrast, education does not have a significant impact on men's religiosity or the child attributes they consider important.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33135,33135,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
"Forced Displacement, the Perpetuation of Autocratic Leaders, and Development in Origin Countries","Nicolas Cabra-Ruiz, Sandra V. Rozo & Maria Micaela Sviatschi","How does forced displacement shape development in origin countries? We examine the case of Venezuela, where over seven million people have been forcibly displaced. Our study compares municipalities with different proportions of foreign-born populations before and after the international oil price shocks that accelerated forced displacement between 2014 and 2019. Our findings show that municipalities with higher foreign-born populations in 1990, exhibiting greater out-migration from Venezuela after 2014, experienced lower economic development and higher inequality. We shed light on a novel mechanism: forced displacement facilitates the perpetuation of autocratic leaders, further hindering development. It does so by weakening the opposition’s voices and facilitating the expansion of organized crime and illicit sources of income.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33131,33131,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Elite Strategies for Big Shocks: The Case of the Fall of the Ming,Carol H. Shiue & Wolfgang Keller,"This paper documents persistence in the power of elite families in Central China despite dynastic change. We study the impact of the fall of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) on couples and their descendants (treatment of people), and present evidence on the response of multigenerational family lines to a big shock. Local Ming elites suffered a decline in influence in the short run, but in the long-run their descendants recovered and tightened their grip on power in their role as the elites of the new Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). In contrast to the recovery of family lines, the fall of Ming had a more persistently negative impact on the regions that historically were most strongly negatively affected by the shock (treatment of regions). The paper suggests that the elite reversal is due to trauma caused by Ming destruction that shifted norms towards the most socially respectable career paths based on the civil service exam; these norms were, to a greater degree, intergenerationally transmitted in family lines that suffered more from the destruction in the fall of the Ming dynasty.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33121,33121,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Input Price Dispersion Across Buyers and Misallocation,"Ariel Burstein, Javier Cravino & Marco Rojas","We leverage a comprehensive dataset of electronic invoices from Chilean firms to document new facts on price dispersion across buyers of manufactured intermediate goods. Over half of firm-to-firm manufacturing sales are accounted for by products that are purchased by more than one buyer in the same month. Price dispersion across buyers is pervasive, with a price range across buyers of 46 percentage points for the average product. Price gaps are highly persistent over time and strongly correlated across different products purchased by the same buyer. While price disparities comove with observable characteristics of buyer-seller pairs—such as size of the buyer and the transaction—these factors account for a small portion of the overall variation in price gaps. We use a workhorse model of production networks to quantify the productivity gains from eliminating observed dispersion in prices across buyers of the same product, under the assumption that this dispersion is driven by buyer-product specific markups. The increase in aggregate productivity (normalized by the sales share of treated multi-buyer firms) ranges from 2 to 7 percent, depending on the calibration of elasticities of substitution. The gains from eliminating markup dispersion across buyers are as large as those of eliminating markup dispersion across products.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33128,33128,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
On the Limits of Chronological Age,"Rainer Kotschy, David E. Bloom & Andrew J. Scott","Analysis of population aging is typically framed in terms of chronological age. However, chronological age itself is not necessarily deeply informative about the aging process. This paper reviews literature and conducts empirical analyses aimed at investigating whether chronological age is a reliable proxy for physiological functioning when used in models of economic behavior and outcomes. We show that chronological age is an unreliable proxy for physiological functioning due to appreciable differences in how aging unfolds across people, health domains, and over time. We further demonstrate that chronological age either fails to predict economic variables when used in lieu of physiological functioning, or that it predicts additional effects on economic behavior and outcomes that are largely unrelated to physiological aging. Continued reliance on chronological age as a proxy for physiological functioning might impede the ability of societies to fully harness the benefits of increasing longevity.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33124,33124,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Concentrating Intelligence: Scaling and Market Structure in Artificial Intelligence,Anton Korinek & Jai Vipra,"This paper examines the evolving structure and competition dynamics of the rapidly growing market for foundation models, with a focus on large language models (LLMs). We describe the technological characteristics that shape the AI industry and have given rise to fierce competition among the leading players. The paper analyzes the cost structure of foundation models, emphasizing the importance of key inputs such as computational resources, data, and talent, and identifies significant economies of scale and scope that may create a tendency towards greater market concentration in the future. We explore two concerns for competition, the risk of market tipping and the implications of vertical integration, and we evaluate policy remedies that aim to maintain a competitive landscape. Looking ahead to increasingly transformative AI systems, we discuss how market concentration could translate into unprecedented accumulation of power, highlighting the broader societal stakes of competition policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33139,33139,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Expecting Climate Change: A Nationwide Field Experiment in the Housing Market,"Daryl Fairweather, Matthew E. Kahn, Robert D. Metcalfe & Sebastian Sandoval Olascoaga","Climate change presents new risks for property in the United States. Due to the high cost and sometimes unavailability of location-specific property risk data, home buyers can greatly benefit from acquiring knowledge about these risks. To explore this, a large-scale nationwide natural field experiment was conducted through Redfin to estimate the causal impact of providing home-specific flood risk information on the behavior of home buyers in terms of their search, bidding, and purchasing decisions. Redfin randomly assigned 17.5 million users to receive information detailing the flood risk associated with the properties they searched for on the platform. Our analysis reveals several key findings: (1) the flood risk information influences every stage of the house buying process, including the initial search, bidding activities, and final purchase; (2) individuals are willing to make trade-offs concerning property amenities in order to own a property with a lower flood risk; (3) the impact of the flood risk information on behavior is more pronounced for users conducting searches in high flood risk areas, but does not differ significantly between buyers in Republican and Democrat Counties; and (4) the information resulted in changes to property prices and altered the market's hedonic equilibrium, providing  a new finding that climate adaptation can be forward-thinking and proactive.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33119,33119,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
Monetary-Fiscal Coordination with International Hegemon,Xuning Ding & Zhengyang Jiang,"Monetary and fiscal policies require coordination to achieve desired macroeconomic outcomes. The literature since Leeper (1991) has focused on two regimes: monetary dominance and fiscal dominance. In both cases, one policy is active while the other is passive and accommodates the former. We study this coordination problem in an international economy, and find a third regime—hegemon dominance. In this case, one country (the hegemon)'s monetary and fiscal authorities can pursue separate policy goals, while the other country's monetary and fiscal policies are both accommodative. For example, the hegemon can pursue a monetary policy unbacked by its fiscal policy. When this happens, the foreign monetary authority has to take the same stance as the hegemon, the foreign fiscal authority has to provide fiscal backing for the monetary stance undertaken by both countries, and the exchange rate adjusts to equilibrate the economy. Our result suggests that the U.S. fiscal policy's independence from its own monetary policy can be made possible by accommodative foreign policies, and that the Fed's effort to fight inflation can succeed despite the high level of public debt which would have required enormous fiscal backing in a closed economy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33123,33123,November 2024,NBER,11/11/2024
A Simple Measure of Anchoring for Short-Run Expected Inflation in FIRE Models,"Peter Lihn Jorgensen, Kevin Lansing","We show that the fraction of non-reoptimizing firms that index prices to the inflation target, rather than lagged inflation, provides a simple measure of anchoring for short-run expected inflation in a New Keynesian model with full-information rational expectations. Higher values of the anchoring measure imply less sensitivity of rational inflation forecasts to movements in actual inflation. The approximate value of the model’s anchoring measure can be inferred from observable data generated by the model itself, as given by 1 minus the autocorrelation statistic for quarterly inflation. We show that a shift in the collective indexing behavior of firms allows the model to account for numerous features of evolving U.S. inflation behavior since 1960.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/11/a-simple-measure-of-anchoring-for-short-run-expected-inflation-in-fire-models,2024-34,2024-11-12,FED-SANFRANCISCO,11/13/2024
Are Friends of Schools the Enemies of Equity? The Interplay of School Funding Policies and External Fundraising,"Lisa Barrow, Sarah Komisarow, Lauren Sartain","School districts across the US have adopted funding policies designed to distribute resources more equitably across schools. Concurrently, schools are increasing external fundraising efforts to supplement district budget allocations. We document both funding policies and fundraising efforts in Chicago Public Schools. We find that adoption of a weighted-student funding policy reallocated more dollars to schools with high shares of students eligible for free/reduced-price lunch, creating a policy-induced per-pupil expenditure gap. Further, almost all schools raised external funds over the study period, with most dollars raised concentrated in schools serving relatively affluent populations. We estimate that external fundraising offset the policy-induced per-pupil expenditure gap between schools enrolling the lowest and highest shares of FRL-eligible students by 23-35 percent.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2424-interplay-of-school-funding-policies-and-external-fundraising,24-24,11.12.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,11/13/2024
Unemployment Insurance and Macro-Financial (In)Stability,"Yavuz Arslan, Ahmet Degerli, Bulent Guler, Gazi Kabas, and Burhan Kuruscu","We identify and study two mechanisms that can overturn the stabilizing effects of unemployment insurance (UI) policies. First, households in economies with more generous UI reduce their precautionary savings and increase their mortgage debt. Second, the share of mortgages, especially those with higher loan-to-income ratios, increases on bank balance sheets. As a result, both bank and household balance sheets become more vulnerable to adverse shocks, which deepens recessions. We demonstrate the importance of these channels by employing a quantitative heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium model and by providing county-level empirical evidence from the U.S. housing and mortgage markets.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/unemployment-insurance-and-macro-financial-instability.htm,2024-087,November 2024,FED-BOARD,11/13/2024

"The Rise of AI Pricing: Trends, Driving Forces, and Implications for Firm Performance","Jonathan Adams, Min Fang, Zheng Liu","We document key stylized facts about the time-series trends and cross-sectional distributions of AI pricing and study its implications for firm performance, both on average and conditional on monetary policy shocks. We use the universe of online job posting data from Lightcast to measure the adoption of AI pricing. We infer that a firm is adopting AI pricing if it posts a job opening that requires AI-related skills and contains the keyword “pricing.” At the aggregate level, the share of AI-pricing jobs in all pricing jobs has increased by more than tenfold since 2010. The increase in AI-pricing jobs has been broad-based, spreading to more industries than other types of AI jobs. At the firm level, larger and more productive firms are more likely to adopt AI pricing. Moreover, firms that adopted AI pricing experienced faster growth in sales, employment, assets, and markups, and their stock returns are also more sensitive to high-frequency monetary policy surprises than non-adopters.  We show that these empirical observations can be rationalized by a simple model where a monopolist firm with incomplete information about the demand function invests in AI pricing to acquire information.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/11/the-rise-of-ai-pricing-trends-driving-forces-and-implications-for-firm-performance,2024-33,2024-11-12,FED-SANFRANCISCO,11/13/2024

Practice Makes Perfect: Learning Effects with Household Point and Density Forecasts of Inflation,"James Mitchell, Taylor Shiroff, Hana Braitsch","This paper shows how both the characteristics and the accuracy of the point and density forecasts from a well-known panel data survey of households' inflationary expectations – the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations – depend on the tenure of survey respondents. Households' point and density forecasts of inflation become significantly more accurate with repeated practice of completing the survey.

"Real effects of credit supply shocks: evidence from Danish banks, firms, and workers","Christofer Schroeder, Simon Juul Hviid","Contractions in credit supply can lead firms to reduce their level of employment, yet little is known about how these shocks affect the composition of firms’ employees and outcomes at the worker level. This paper investigates how bank distress affects credit provision and its effects on employment beyond firm-level aggregates. To do so, we use a novel dataset built from administrative and tax records linking all banks, firms, and workers in Denmark. We show that banks that were particularly exposed to the 2008-09 financial crisis cut lending to firms, and firms were unable to fully compensate with financing from alternate sources. The decrease in credit supply led to a drop in firm-level employment, with effects concentrated among firms with low pre-crisis liquidity, and on employment of low-educated and nonmanagerial workers. At the worker level, we find that positive effects on unemployment were driven by effects on low-educated, non-managerial and short-tenured workers. Our estimates suggest that cuts in bank lending can account for at least 5% of the fall in employment of low-educated workers in our sample, and are an important factor behind heterogeneous employment dynamics in times of contractionary credit.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3001~2650b4b003.en.pdf?10f15586e9ccf06b6ad71338f95814a6,3001,14 November 2024,ECB,11/14/2024
Cultural Change Through Writing Style: Gendered Pronoun Use in the Economics Profession,"Camilo Garcia-Jimeno, Sahar Parsa","Through their writing, people often reflect their values. Since the 1970s, academic economists have gradually changed their third-person pronoun choices, from using the masculine form to incorporating feminine and plural forms. We document this transition empirically, and examine the role of social interactions among economists in driving the cultural change reflected in these choices. Our analysis relies on a model where writing style depends on the influence of academic peers, the implicit negotiation between co-authors, and individual authors’ preferences for expressing gender equality values in their writing. We directly measure peer influence relying on time-varying academic connections between economists, and propose a methodology that uses a homophily-based model of co-authoring decisions to isolate the effect of peer influence from unobserved personal preferences. The model allows us to decompose the observed changes in writing style over the last 50 years into generational shifts, the increasing prevalence of co-authorship in the profession, the increasing share of female economists, and peer influence. Generational changes and the growing share of women in the profession play a minor role. Early on, contrarian economists accelerated the pace of change in writing styles by moving away from their peers’ behavior. The large fraction of conformists and the overall homophily in co-authoring, in contrast, slowed the adoption of innovative writing styles by restricting economists’ exposure to peers with different gender-attitude signaling preferences.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-23,2024-23,November 2024,FED-CHICAGO,11/14/2024
The Politics of Debt in the Era of Rising Rates,Marina Azzimonti  and  Nirvana Mitra,"We examine how the post-pandemic trajectory of risk-free rates—from historically low levels in 2020 to a steep rise in 2022—affects sovereign debt management and default risk in emerging markets (EMs). Using a dynamic political economy model, we show that weak institutional environments with political incentives to engage in corruption spending lead to over-borrowing and increased default risk, especially during low-rate periods. As rates rise, EMs face high risks of default or the need for austerity programs, depending on the severity of productivity shocks. While International Financial Institution (IFI) lending provides short-term relief, it can fuel moral hazard and corruption. Making IFI loans contingent on anti-corruption efforts reduces default risk. However, even full monitoring cannot eliminate the incentives for fiscal mismanagement, as governments may still over-borrow during favorable periods without addressing sustainability. We also find that Quantitative Performance Criteria (QPC), such as a debt-ceiling rule, are less effective as they leave room for corruption that creates default risk and can generate welfare losses relative to a scenario without IFI debt.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2024/wp_24-12,24-12,November 2024,FED-RICHMOND,11/14/2024

Leveraging on highly granular data and information on bilateral exposures, we assess the impact of liquidity and solvency shocks and demonstrate how a combined endogenous reactions of banks, investment funds and insurance companies can further amplify losses in the financial system.

Firms’ Supply Chain Adaptation to Carbon Taxes,"Pierre Coster, Julian di Giovanni, and Isabelle Mejean","This paper investigates how firms adapt their sourcing of clean and dirty inputs in response to changes in climate policy. We use information from the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to create a new classification of clean and dirty products based on whether they are subject to a domestic or a border carbon tax. We then combine this dataset with French firms’ product-level import data over 2000–2019 and estimate that firms’ propensity to import dirty inputs from non-EU countries increased in the 2010s, reflecting carbon leakage. A heterogeneous firm model is then used to quantify the impact of changes in firms’ sourcing of clean and dirty inputs given the implementation of a carbon tax and a carbon tariff. The simulated ETS carbon tax scenario is able to match leakage observed in the data and leads to a higher price level and a modest decline in emissions. The scenario that further includes the CBAM carbon tariff reverses carbon leakage at the cost of an additional rise in prices. Overall, household welfare declines because the higher costs associated with the carbon policies outweigh the benefits of reduced emissions.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1136,1136,2024-11-13,FED-NEWYORK,11/15/2024
Clustering in Natural Disaster Losses,Jacob Kim-Sherman and Lee Seltzer,"In contrast with findings in climate science, economists often treat losses from natural disasters as statistically independent of one another. To better incorporate scientific insights into economic research, we introduce a methodology to identify spatial and temporal clusters in datasets on losses from natural disasters.

The Crowding-In Effects of Local Government Debt in China,"Xiaoming Li, Zheng Liu, Yuchao Peng, Zhiwei Xu","We study how changes in the composition of Chinese local government debt influenced bank risk taking, credit allocation, and local productivity. Using confidential loan-level data and a difference-in-difference identification approach, we show that a debt-to-bond swap program for local governments implemented in 2015 significantly increased bank risk taking through a risk-weighting channel under Basel III capital regulations. The debt swap program converted bank holdings of municipal corporate debt to local government bonds, reducing banks’ risk-weighted assets. Banks responded by lowering credit spreads on loans to privately owned firms (POEs) relative to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with significantly larger reductions in POE credit spreads in provinces with more outstanding government debt. Furthermore, the credit reallocation toward more productive private firms—a crowding in effect of the debt swap—significantly raised local productivity.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/11/the-crowding-in-effects-of-local-government-debt-in-china,2024-35,2024-11-14,FED-SANFRANCISCO,11/15/2024

Specifically, the behavior of hours worked is notably different before and after the 1980s. In addition, the importance of technology shocks as a major driver of aggregate fluctuations has increased over time. They play a dominant role in the second subsample, but much less so in the first. We build a rich structural model to explain these new facts. Using impulse-response matching, we find that a change in the stance of monetary policy and the nature of intangible capital accumulation both played dominant roles in accounting for the differences in TFP shock propagation.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2024/wp_24-13,24-13,November 2024,FED-RICHMOND,11/16/2024
How does fiscal policy affect the transmission of monetary policy into cross-border bank lending? Cross-country evidence," Swapan-Kumar Pradhan, El&#337;d Takáts, Judit Temesvary",We use a rarely accessed BIS database on bilateral cross-border bank claims by bank nationality to examine the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies.

Economic Surveillance using Corporate Text,"Tarek Alexander Hassan, Stephan Hollander, Aakash Kalyani, Laurence van Lent, Markus Schwedeler & Ahmed Tahoun","This article applies simple methods from computational linguistics to analyze unstructured corporate texts for economic surveillance. We apply text-as-data approaches to earnings conference call transcripts, patent texts, and job postings to uncover unique insights into how markets and firms respond to economic shocks, such as a nuclear disaster or a geopolitical event—insights that often elude traditional data sources. This method enhances our ability to extract actionable intelligence from textual data, thereby aiding policy-making and strategic corporate decisions. By integrating computational linguistics into the analysis of economic shocks, our study opens new possibilities for real-time economic surveillance and offers a more nuanced understanding of firm-level reactions in volatile economic environments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33158,33158,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
Federal Reserve Independence and Congressional Intent: A Reappraisal of Marriner Eccles’ Role in the Reformulation of the Fed in 1935,Gary Richardson & David W. Wilcox,Congressional intent concerning the independence of the Federal Reserve matters because it protects the public from the politicization of monetary policy. Attempts to subordinate monetary policy to the President could easily end up in front of the Supreme Court. The outcome of such a case would depend importantly on the historical record. Understanding what Congress intended when it designed the decision-making structure of the Fed requires a clear understanding Marriner Eccles’ proposal for the structure of monetary policymaking in Title II of the Banking Act of 1935 and the Congressional response. Eccles' proposal vested monetary policymaking in a body beholden to the President. Eccles argued that leaders of the Fed should serve at the discretion of the President and implement the President's monetary program. The Senate and House rejected Eccles' proposal and explicitly designed the Fed's leadership structure to limit politicians'—particularly the President's—influence on monetary policymaking.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w33174,33174,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
Forecasting Natural Gas Prices in Real Time,"Christiane Baumeister, Florian Huber, Thomas K. Lee & Francesco Ravazzolo","This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the forecastability of the real price of natural gas in the United States at the monthly frequency considering a universe of models that differ in their complexity and economic content. Our key finding is that considerable reductions in mean-squared prediction error relative to a random walk benchmark can be achieved in real time for forecast horizons of up to two years. A particularly promising model is a six-variable Bayesian vector autoregressive model that includes the fundamental determinants of the supply and demand for natural gas. To capture real-time data constraints of these and other predictor variables, we assemble a rich database of historical vintages from multiple sources. We also compare our model-based forecasts to readily available model-free forecasts provided by experts and futures markets. Given that no single forecasting method dominates all others, we explore the usefulness of pooling forecasts and find that combining forecasts from individual models selected in real time based on their most recent performance delivers the most accurate forecasts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33156,33156,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
Beyond the Fundamentals: How Media-Driven Narratives Influence Cross-Border Capital Flows,"Isha Agarwal, Wentong Chen & Eswar S. Prasad","We provide the first empirical evidence on how media-driven narratives influence cross-border institutional investment flows. Applying natural language processing techniques to one-and-a-half million newspaper articles, we document substantial cross-country variation in sentiment and risk indices constructed from domestic media narratives about China in 15 countries. These narratives significantly affect portfolio flows, even after controlling for macroeconomic and financial fundamentals. This impact is smaller for investors with greater familiarity or private information about China and larger during periods of heightened uncertainty. Political and environmental narratives are as influential as economic narratives. Investors react more sharply to negative narratives than positive ones.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33159,33159,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
"Textual Factors: A Scalable, Interpretable, and Data-driven Approach to Analyzing Unstructured Information","Lin William Cong, Tengyuan Liang, Xiao Zhang & Wu Zhu","We introduce a general approach for analyzing large-scale text-based data, combining the strengths of neural network language processing and generative statistical modeling to create a factor structure of unstructured data for downstream regressions typically used in social sciences. We generate textual factors by (i) representing texts using vector word embedding, (ii) clustering the vectors using Locality-Sensitive Hashing to generate supports of topics, and (iii) identifying relatively interpretable spanning clusters (i.e., textual factors) through topic modeling. Our data-driven approach captures complex linguistic structures while ensuring computational scalability and economic interpretability, plausibly attaining certain advantages over and complementing other unstructured data analytics used by researchers, including emergent large language models. We conduct initial validation tests of the framework and discuss three types of its applications: (i) enhancing prediction and inference with texts, (ii) interpreting (non-text-based) models, and (iii) constructing new text-based metrics and explanatory variables. We illustrate each of these applications using examples in finance and economics such as macroeconomic forecasting from news articles, interpreting multi-factor asset pricing models from corporate filings, and measuring theme-based technology breakthroughs from patents. Finally, we provide a flexible statistical package of textual factors for online distribution to facilitate future research and applications.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33168,33168,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024

Investing in Customer Capital,"Bianca He, Lauren I. Mostrom & Amir Sufi","Firms invest heavily in customer capital, and such investment is a main source of intangible capital value. This study measures investment in customer capital using sales and marketing expense from income statements, information on salaries paid to workers in sales and marketing, and text from annual 10-K SEC filings describing firms' sales and marketing strategies. Firms emphasize brand value, sales force, customer service, advertising, and the acquisition and use of customer data as sales and marketing strategies. Industries focused on platform business models, online sales, and the production of high tech manufactured goods invest most heavily in customer capital. Industry-level variation in the intensity of sales and marketing expense and R&D expense explains a large amount of the variation across industries in the value of intangible capital. Residual sales, general, and administrative expense after removing sales and marketing expense is uncorrelated with intangible capital value. Industries that invest most heavily in customer capital are growing as a share of aggregate revenue and enterprise value.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33171,33171,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024

These wage adjustments occur only sporadically, due to the presence of renegotiation costs. The model is amenable to analytical solution, yielding new insights for several labor market phenomena, including: (1) key features of empirical distributions of changes in pay among job stayers; (2) a near-""memorylessness"" property in wage dynamics whereby hiring wages have only limited influence on later wages and allocation decisions; and (3) a crucial role for recruitment and retention bonuses in sustaining efficient employment relationships.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33149,33149,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
Estimating Aggregate Human Capital Externalities,"Junjie Guo, Nicolas A. Roys & Ananth Seshadri","This paper estimates two measures of human capital externalities. By incorporating externalities into an overlapping-generations model of human capital accumulation with Compulsory Schooling Laws (CSL), we show that human capital externalities can be estimated from the effects of CSL for one generation on wages of other generations. Using an instrumental-variable strategy deduced from the model, we find one more year of average schooling at the U.S. state level raises individual wages by 6-8%. Taking this reduced-form estimate into account, we find the elasticity of a typical firm’s productivity with respect to the average human capital of an economy is 0.121.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33151,33151,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
Greens are Right to be Suspicious of Carbon Offsets,Geoffrey Heal,"I distinguish between reduction offsets and removal offsets, the former generated by a reduction in the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and the latter generated by the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. I show that only removal offsets make any contribution to mitigating climate change. There is a simple intuitive explanation: a firm buys an offset to compensate for the fact that it is emitting greenhouse gases and plans to continue to do so. What should “compensate” mean in this context? That the purchase of the offset undoes the negative impact of the continuing emissions on the climate. This can only happen by the removal from the atmosphere of a quantity of greenhouse gases equal to that emitted by the purchaser of the offset. So an offset which compensates for the climatic impact of emissions has to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. I also review carbon offsets generated by forest management, as of all currently-traded offsets these are the closest to removal offsets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33170,33170,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
Using Information to Curb Racial Discrimination,"Christopher R. Knittel, Donald MacKenzie, Michiko Namazu, Bora Ozaltun, Dan Svirsky & Stephen Zoepf","We test whether more information about customers decreases racial bias. Our setting is the market for shared mobility services. Prior work by Ge et al. (2020) found that Uber drivers are two times more likely to cancel a ride if the passenger’s name is one used predominantly by African Americans. In a randomized control trial, we test whether two alterations to the Uber platform app reduce racial discrimination. Within the standard Uber app, drivers see only the passenger’s rating before accepting a ride. Once they accept the ride, they see the name of the passenger. In the first intervention, we increased the size of the font of the rating to draw attention to the quality of the passenger. In the second intervention, the passenger’s name appears from the beginning. Using the control group observations, we confirmed that the more likely African Americans were to use a name, the more likely a driver cancels the ride. However, increasing the font size of the passenger’s rating eliminates this racial bias. In contrast, we do not find much evidence that showing the name on the initial screen reduces or increases cancellation rates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33118,33118,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
Immobility As Memory: Some New Approaches to Characterizing Intergenerational Persistence via Markov Chains,"Lawrence Blume, Neil A. Cholli, Steven N. Durlauf & Aleksandra Lukina","This paper proposes some new measures of intergenerational persistence based on the idea of characterizing the memory of origin in the stochastic process that links the socioeconomic classes of parents and children. We introduce “memory curves” for all future generations given any initial condition of class for a family dynasty, which reveal how initial conditions interact with the transition process between parents and children to create mobility and persistence. We also propose ways to aggregate information across different classes to produce overall characterizations of mobility in the population. To illustrate our measures, we estimate occupational “memory curves” using U.S. survey data. Our findings show that, on average, the memory of initial conditions dissipates largely within three generations, though there is meaningful heterogeneity in mobility rates across dynasties originating from different occupational classes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33166,33166,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
The Power of Daughters: How Physicians' Family Influences Female Patients' Health,"Mette Gørtz, Ida L. Kristiansen & Tianyi Wang","While physicians are crucial to patient outcomes, what determines physician behavior and decision making remains to be understood. In this paper, we study how physicians’ family characteristics influence physicians’ behavior and patient health outcomes. Using administrative data from Denmark and the natural experiment of a child’s gender, we find that having daughters affects male primary care physicians’ practices and the health of their female patients. Specifically, female patients cared for by male physicians with one additional daughter (compared to one additional son) are 5.5% less likely to die from female-specific cancers, including breast and gynecologic cancers. This improvement in outcomes appears to stem from enhanced cancer screening and preventive efforts, leading to earlier detection and more successful prevention. Exploring potential mechanisms, we find that male physicians with more daughters show greater attentiveness to female-specific health guidelines and are more likely to collaborate with women. We also find suggestive evidence from survey data that female patients report higher levels of trust, empathy, and clearer communication with these physicians.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33146,33146,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024

The Evolution of Gender in the Labor Market,"Claudia Olivetti, Jessica Pan & Barbara Petrongolo","This chapter traces the evolution of the study of gender in the labor market, focusing on how academic thinking on this topic has evolved alongside real world developments in gender inequality from the 1980s to the present. We present a simple model of female labor supply  to illustrate how various forces discussed in the literature (e.g., productivity differentials, unequal gender roles, wage markdowns) affect the gender earnings gap. A major development in the literature is a clearer distinction between intrinsic differences in preferences and skills between men and women versus differential constraints in driving gender gaps. We discuss insights from research on the relative importance of these explanations, and the implications for economic efficiency. We highlight that much of the literature today emphasizes the relevance of gendered constraints, where women and men typically face differential trade-offs between family and career, with implications for job sorting, job search, and earnings. These constraints have their roots in gender roles within the household that are shaped by wider societal norms. We review recent research that establishes the relevance of identity and norms for understanding gender inequalities in the labor market, both on the supply-side and on the demand-side, as well as what drives the formation and evolution of these norms. Finally, we conclude with suggestions for future research.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33153,33153,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
The Distributional Implications of Itemized Medical Deductions,"Gopi Shah Goda, Ithai Lurie, Priyanka S. Parikh & Chelsea Swete","Approximately $76 billion in out-of-pocket medical spending was deducted as an itemized medical deduction (IMD) in 2021, resulting in about $9 billion in federal forgone tax revenue. We use data from U.S. tax returns to examine how these tax savings are distributed across income and age, how the distributions differ from the mortgage interest deduction, and how the distributions changed with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While a given level of medical spending is less likely to be above the income threshold for higher-income households, itemization rates and marginal tax rates increase with income, resulting in tax savings skewed towards higher-income taxpayers: 94 percent of the tax savings accrue to those in the top half of the income distribution. The tax savings are also highly concentrated at older ages, with 42 percent accruing to those over age 65. Using rich survey data on out-of-pocket medical spending, we illustrate how the distribution of tax savings varies across policy alternatives. We find that expanding eligibility for the tax subsidy would likely reduce the concentration of tax savings at higher incomes and increase the concentration of tax benefits at older ages.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33157,33157,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
Therapy to Reduce Violence and Improve Institutional Safety During Incarceration,"Mary Kate Batistich, William N.

Step Up aims to address self-destructive thought and behavior patterns through a combination of group classes, one-on-one counseling, and a structured workbook. We compare individuals over time who enter the Step Up program to a group of eligible and interested nonparticipants in an unbalanced two-way fixed effects framework. Despite similarities in observable characteristics and initial behavior metrics, individuals who enter Step Up exhibit a 49% reduction in monthly behavioral incident rates compared to the untreated group, which is about an 8-percentage point decline.

A Simple Model of Average Inflation Targeting,Laurence M. Ball & Junnan Zhang,"This paper derives the optimal monetary-policy rule in a simple model with anchored inflation expectations and an effective lower bound (ELB) on interest rates, assuming a long-run inflation goal of 2%. With fully anchored expectations, the optimal policy is a version of average inflation targeting: to offset periods when the ELB forces inflation below 2%, policymakers target a fixed inflation rate above 2% whenever they are unconstrained. With expectations that are partially but not fully anchored, the inflation target away from the ELB varies with the state of the economy. For some parameter values, the target is highest after a period when inflation has been low.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33160,33160,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
"The Economics of “Buy Now, Pay Later”: A Merchant’s Perspective","Tobias Berg, Valentin Burg, Jan Keil & Manju Puri","“Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) is a key innovation in consumer payments. It bundles the sale of a product with a subsidized loan, effectively offering lower prices to low-creditworthiness customers. BNPL thereby allows merchants to price-discriminate among customers with different willingness-to-pay.  Consistent with a price-discrimination mechanism, we show that BNPL increases sales by 20%, driven by low-creditworthiness customers and products where market power is larger. We find that the benefits of offering BNPL significantly outweigh the costs for the merchant. Our findings help to explain the surge in popularity of BNPL in e-commerce around the world.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33152,33152,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
Couch-Locked with the Munchies: Effects of Recreational Marijuana Laws on Exercise and Nutrition,Thomas Wilk ⓡ Monica Deza ⓡ Timothy Hodge ⓡ Shooshan Danagoulian,"As recreational marijuana laws (RML) expanded marijuana access over the last decade, still very little is known about the impact of RML on two costly social behaviors that may arise as a consequence of marijuana consumption: unhealthy eating (i.e. munchies), and sedentary lifestyle (i.e. couch-lock). Using Nielsen IQ Consumer Panel data, we find that the passage of RML led to an increase in the number of grocery store trips that involved “junk food”, as well as the amount of respective “junk food” spending. This effect is particularly driven by an increase in snacks, cookies, and candy. Using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), we find that the passage of RML led to a decrease in exercise, particularly driven by a reduction in cardio, and suggestive evidence of more time spent at home. The findings are robust to alternative methods that take into account the staggered implementation of RML. These results suggest that RMLs have an adverse effect on health through “munchies” and “couch-lock,” which pose a significant public health challenge to diet and lifestyle-related chronic conditions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33176,33176,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
The Misery of Diversity,Resul Cesur & Sadullah Yıldırım,"Evolutionary accounts assert that while diversity may lower subjective well-being (SWB) by creating an evolutionary mismatch between evolved psychological tendencies and the current social environment, human societies can adapt to diversity via intergroup contact under appropriate conditions. Exploiting a novel natural experiment in history, we examine the impact of the social environment, captured by population diversity, on SWB. We find that diversity lowers cognitive and hedonic measures of SWB. Diversity-induced deteriorations in the quality of the macrosocial environment, captured by reduced social cohesion, retarded state capacity, and increased inequality in economic opportunities, emerge as mechanisms explaining our findings. The analysis of first- and second-generation immigrants in Europe and the USA reveals that the misery of home country diversity persists even after neutralizing the role of the social environment. However, these effects diminish among the second generation, suggesting that long-term improvements in the social environment can alleviate the burden of diversity. Finally, in exploring whether human societies can adapt to diversity, we show evidence that diversity causes adopting cultural traits (such as establishing stronger family ties, assigning greater importance to friendships, and adopting a positive attitude towards competition) that can mitigate the misery of diversity. These results survive an exhaustive set of robustness checks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33163,33163,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024

By combining these data with more recent survey and administrative data, we assemble the largest dataset on the socioeconomic backgrounds of students at American colleges spanning the last 100 years. We document the following: First, despite a large increase in the share of lower-income students in the overall college-going population, the representation of these students at elite private or public colleges has remained at similarly low levels throughout the last century. Second, the representation of upper-income students at elite colleges decreased after World War II, but this group has regained its high representation since the 1980s. Third, while there has been no increase in the economic diversity of elite private and public colleges, these colleges have become more racially and geographically diverse. Fourth, two major policy changes in the history of American higher education, namely the G.I.

Unwarranted Racial Disparity in U.S. Foster Care Placement,"E. Jason Baron, Joseph J. Doyle Jr., Natalia Emanuel & Peter Hull","Black children in the U.S. are twice as likely as white children to spend time in foster care. Such racial disparities raise concerns of discrimination, but might also reflect differences in the underlying need for intervention. This paper estimates unwarranted disparities (UDs)—racial differences in placement rates for children with the same potential for future maltreatment—in national data. We use non-parametric bounds on the potential for future child maltreatment that rely on weak and transparent assumptions. Nationwide, we find that Black children are placed into foster care at higher rates than white children with identical potential to experience subsequent maltreatment; this UD is 42% larger than conventional estimates that control for observables. We demonstrate that UD varies across states and that both the proportion of Black individuals in the population and the racial makeup of caseworkers within a state are key factors in predicting the level of UD. Finally, we show that UD is five times larger among children with potential for subsequent maltreatment than among children without, and that it declined from 2008 to 2020, primarily due to a decline in the placement rate of Black children with potential for subsequent maltreatment. The concentration of UD in cases with potential for future maltreatment yields important policy implications, as it may indicate an ""underplacement"" of white children—with declining racial gaps over time potentially elevating the risk of maltreatment for Black children.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33154,33154,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
The Signaling Value of Government Action: The Effect of Istanbul Convention on Female Murders,Güneş Aşık & Naci H. Mocan,"We analyze the expressive content of government action, focusing on Istanbul Convention, an international treaty aimed at protecting women against violence, signed and ratified by 39 countries. In 2021, ten years after signing the Convention, the Turkish government withdrew from it, on the grounds that it ""was hijacked by a group of people attempting to normalize homosexuality, which is incompatible with Turkey’s social and family values.” Although this withdrawal did not alter existing laws or law enforcement practices, women's rights advocates viewed it as a signal of tolerance for violence against women. We use two separate datasets on female murders from independent sources. Analyses, including a difference-in-difference model with male homicide data, show that the withdrawal led to an additional 70 female murders per year, primarily committed by intimate partners. The effect is more pronounced in provinces where the long-governing religious-conservative coalition parties have stronger voter support and in provinces with lower education levels. We also show that Turkey's entry into the Convention in 2011 had the opposite impact, leading to a decrease in female murders. The signing of the Convention, which acted as a normative signal against violence, and the subsequent enactment of comprehensive legislation strengthening deterrence, had distinct effects. The signaling effect of the Entry was more significant in the same provinces that reacted more strongly to the Exit: those with lower education levels, stronger support for the governing party, and the Eastern region of the country. These findings indicate that government actions are interpreted as normative signals by society.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33169,33169,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
A New Measure of Surviving Children that Sheds Light on Long-term Trends in Fertility,Anup Malani & Ari Jacob,"The world has experienced a dramatic decline in total fertility rate (TFR) since the Industrial Revolution. Yet the consequences of this decline flow not merely from a reduction in births, but from a reduction in the number of surviving children. We propose a new measure of the number of surviving children per female, which we call the effective fertility rate (EFR). EFR can be approximated as the product of TFR and the probability of survival. Moreover, TFR changes can be decomposed into changes that preserve EFR and those that change EFR. We specialized EFR to measure the number of daughters that survive to reproduce (reproductive EFR) and the number children that survive to become workers (labor EFR).
We use three data sets to shed light on EFR over time across locations. First, we use data from 165 countries between 1950-2019 to show that one-third of the global decline in TFR during this period did not change labor EFR, suggesting that a substantial portion of fertility decline merely compensated for higher survival rates. Focusing on the change in labor EFR, at least 40% of variation cannot be explained by economic factors such as income, prices, education levels, structural transformation, an urbanization, leaving room for explanations like cultural change. Second, using historical demographic data on European countries since 1750, we find that there was dramatic fluctuation in labor EFR in Europe around each of the World Wars, a phenomenon that is distinct from the demographic transition. However, prior to that fluctuation, EFRs were remarkably constant, even as European countries were undergoing demographic transitions. Indeed, even when EFRs fell below 2 after 1975, we find that EFRs remained stable rather than continuing to decline. Third, data from the US since 1800 reveal that, despite great differences in mortality rates, Black and White populations have remarkably similar numbers of surviving children over time.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33175,33175,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
"From Labor to Intermediates: Firm Growth, Input Substitution, and Monopsony",Matthias Mertens & Benjamin Schoefer,"We document and dissect a new stylized fact about firm growth: the shift from labor to intermediate inputs. This shift occurs in input quantities, cost and output shares, and output elasticities. We establish this fact using German firm-level data and replicate it in administrative firm data from 11 additional countries. We also document these patterns in micro-aggregated industry data for 20 European countries (and, with respect to industry cost shares, for the US). We rationalize this novel regularity within a parsimonious model featuring (i) an elasticity of substitution between intermediates and labor that exceeds unity, and (ii) an increasing shadow price of labor relative to intermediates, due to monopsony power over labor or labor adjustment costs. The shift from labor to intermediates accounts for one half to one third of the decline in the labor share in growing firms (the remainder is due to wage markdowns and markups) and rationalizes most of the labor share decline in growing industries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33172,33172,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
Do Minimum Wages Reduce Job Opportunities for Blacks?,David Neumark & Jyotsana Kala,"We provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of minimum wages on blacks, and on the relative impacts on blacks vs. whites. We study not only teenagers – the focus of much of the minimum wage-employment literature – but also other low-skill groups. We focus primarily on employment, which has been the prime concern with the minimum wage research literature. We find evidence that job loss effects from higher minimum wages are much more evident for blacks, and in contrast not very detectable for whites, and are often large enough to generate adverse effects on earnings. We supplement this work with additional analysis that distinguishes between effects of an individual’s race and the race composition of where they live. The extensive residential segregation by race in the United States raises the question of whether the more adverse effects of minimum wages on blacks are attributable to more adverse effects on black individuals, or more adverse effects on neighborhoods with large black populations. We find relatively little evidence of heterogeneity in effects across areas defined by the share black among residents.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33167,33167,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
Nonpayment and Eviction in the Rental Housing Market,"John Eric Humphries, Scott T. Nelson, Dam Linh Nguyen, Winnie van Dijk & Daniel C. Waldinger","Recent research has documented the prevalence and consequences of evictions in the United States, but our understanding of the drivers of eviction and the scope for policy to reduce evictions remains limited. We use novel lease-level ledger data from high-eviction rental markets to characterize key determinants of landlord eviction decisions: the persistence of shocks to tenant default risk, landlords' information about these shocks, and landlords' costs of eviction. Our data show that nonpayment is common, is often tolerated by landlords, and is often followed by recovery, suggesting that landlords face a trade-off between initiating a costly eviction or waiting to learn whether a tenant can continue paying. We develop and estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of the eviction decision that captures this trade-off. Estimated eviction costs are on the order of 2 to 3 months of rent, and the majority of evictions involve tenants who are unlikely to pay going forward. As a result, while commonly-proposed policies can generate additional forbearance for tenants, they do not prevent most evictions. Compared to policies that create delays in the eviction process, increasing filing fees or providing short-term rent subsidies are more likely to prevent evictions of tenants who would resume paying.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33155,33155,November 2024,NBER,11/18/2024
The Public Charge Rule and Program Participation Among U.S. Citizens,"Kristin Butcher, Luojia Hu, Ryan Perry","Use of public assistance by noncitizens is controversial. Before 2018, institutionalization and receipt of cash benefits were considered as evidence of whether immigrants were likely to become a “public charge” and, therefore, ineligible for citizenship. But a new rule—proposed in 2018 and finalized in 2020—also made participation in SNAP/food stamps and Medicaid relevant as evidence. We examine whether participation in SNAP/food stamps and Medicaid among U.S.-born children—whose own eligibility for program participation should be unaffected by the new rule—has changed, based on the citizenship status of their parents. We find evidence that, after the 2018 proposal, U.S.-born children with noncitizen parents are less likely than the children of U.S.-born parents to participate in these programs. We discuss the literature on “chilling effects” and on the impact of safety net programs on children’s long-term outcomes.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-24,2024-24,November 2024,FED-CHICAGO,11/19/2024
Labor Market Effects of Worker- and Employer-Targeted Immigration Enforcement,"Pia M. Orrenius, Madeline Zavodny and Chloe Smith","Hiring someone who is not authorized to work in the United States is illegal, and employers who knowingly hire unauthorized immigrant workers may face civil and criminal penalties. The federal government uses a variety of actions, including worksite raids and paperwork audits, to enforce the prohibition on hiring unauthorized workers. Compliance costs and the possibility of becoming the target of an immigration enforcement action may affect U.S. businesses’ decisions about whom to hire as well as how many workers to employ and how much to pay them, but little previous research has studied such potential impacts. We find that increases in worksite enforcement actions in an industry raise employment but reduce the average wage. Enforcement also boosts both hires and separations, so worker turnover rises. Actions that target employers—audits, investigations, fines and criminal charges—have larger effects than raids, which target workers. The results are consistent with businesses shifting to on-the-books or legal workers when immigration enforcement activity increases. However, tougher enforcement does not lead to an increase in business sign-ups in E-Verify or IMAGE, which are two federal government programs that can help businesses determine whether workers are authorized. This suggests that, even in the face of tougher enforcement, employers find it costly to use programs that check workers’ employment eligibility.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2413.pdf,2413,"November 13, 2024",FED-DALLAS,11/20/2024

Using two complementary nonlinear statistical approaches, we assess which utility formulations and corresponding stochastic discount factors best align with U.S. data. We provide evidence that habit formation is essential for capturing the time variation in the stochastic discount factor necessary to match the data. This increased time variation raises the carbon price by 32% and makes it five times more procyclical compared to standard models.

"Locked In: Rate Hikes, Housing Markets, and Mobility","Aditya Aladangady, Jacob Krimmel, and Tess Scharlemann","Rising interest rates in 2022 introduced large moving costs for homeowners with low, fixed-rate mortgages. Using a novel dataset linking mortgage loans, consumer credit profiles, and property sales, we examine the effects of rate hikes on household mobility and the broader economic impacts of the resulting mortgage rate lock-in. As market rates rise relative to those on borrowers' existing loans, likelihood of moving falls with the highest elasticity among borrowers just ""in the money."" Our results suggest about 44% of the decline in moves among mortgage holders between 2021 and 2022 may be attributable to the widening gap between borrower's existing and market rates. We find limited scope for labor misallocation due to lock-in, as moves across labor market areas are rather unaffected. Instead, lock-in primarily reduces within-metro churn and moves up the housing ladder, leading to fewer real estate listings and greater house price growth. We explain lock-in-driven price increases through a housing search model: in a seller's market, reduced churn raises market tightness, driving up prices. Consistent with such a model, we show measures of market tightness increase in response to lock-in, with the most significant effects in markets that were already tight.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/locked-in-rate-hikes-housing-markets-and-mobility.htm,2024-088,November 2024,FED-BOARD,11/21/2024
Nonparametric Local Projections,"Sílvia Gonçalves, Ana María Herrera, Lutz Kilian and Elena Pesavento","Nonlinearities play an increasingly important role in applied work when studying the responses of macroeconomic aggregates to policy shocks. Seemingly natural adaptations of the popular local linear projection estimator to nonlinear settings may fail to recover the population responses of interest. In this paper we study the properties of an alternative nonparametric local projection estimator of the conditional and unconditional responses of an outcome variable to an observed identified shock. We discuss alternative ways of implementing this estimator and how to allow for data-dependent tuning parameters. Our results are based on data generating processes that involve, respectively, nonlinearly transformed regressors, state-dependent coefficients and nonlinear interactions between shocks and state variables. Monte Carlo simulations show that a local-linear specification of the estimator tends to work well in reasonably large samples and is robust to nonlinearities of unknown form.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2414.pdf,2414,"November 15, 2024",FED-DALLAS,11/21/2024

Credit Supply and Hedge Fund Performance: Evidence from Prime Broker Surveys,"Dan Li, Phillip J.

Using dealer surveys and hedge fund regulatory filings, we identify individual funds' credit supply from the availability of credit under agreements currently in place between a hedge fund and its prime brokers. We find that hedge funds connected to prime brokers that make more credit available to their hedge fund clients increase their borrowing and generate higher returns and alphas. These effects are more pronounced among hedge funds that rely on a small number of prime brokers, and those that rely on borrowing rather than derivatives for their leverage.

How Important Are Cultural Frictions for Internal Migration? Evidence from the Nineteenth Century United States,"Taylor Jaworski, Erik O.

We use a gravity equation to estimate the elasticity of migration flows with respect to the two components of cultural distance as well as a standard measure of travel costs via the transportation network in the United States between 1850 and 1870. Our findings indicate a modest role for cultural distance relative to travel costs in explaining migration flows. We construct migration costs that reflect the distinct contributions of cultural distance and travel costs, and use an economic geography model of migration to quantify their effects. Travel costs are substantially more important than cultural distance for aggregate welfare. Nevertheless, we provide evidence that the components of cultural distance play a role in shaping of how many people move and their final destinations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33192,33192,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
Overcoming Racial Gaps in School Preferences: The Effect of Peer Diversity on School Choice,Clemence M. Idoux & Viola Corradini,"Differences in school choice by race contribute to school segregation and unequal access to effective schools. Conditional on test score and district of residence, Black and Hispanic families consistently choose schools with fewer white and Asian students, lower average achievement, and lower value-added. This paper combines unique survey data and administrative data from New York City to identify the determinants of racial disparities in school choice and shows that attending a more diverse middle school can mitigate racial choice gaps. Instrumental variable estimates show that middle school students exposed to more diverse peers apply to and enroll in high schools that are also more diverse. These effects particularly benefit Black and Hispanic students who, as a result, enroll in higher value-added high schools. A post-application survey of guardians of high school applicants suggests that most cross-race differences in choice stem from information gaps and homophily in preferences for school demographics. The survey results also reveal that exposure to diverse middle school peers reduces racial differences in choices by addressing these underlying determinants: it increases preferences for peer diversity and broadens the range of known school options.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33179,33179,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
The Color of Ideas: Racial Dynamics and Citations in Economics,"Marlène Koffi, Roland Pongou & Leonard Wantchekon","This paper investigates the existence of racial disparities in the dissemination of ideas using the paper citation network in economics. Exploiting a comprehensive dataset of over 330,000 publications from 1950 to 2021, combined with manually collected data from the CVs of thousands of economists, we document that papers authored by non-White scholars (Black, Hispanic, or Asian) receive 5.1% to 9.6% fewer citations than those authored by White scholars. The citation gap remains or even amplifies with increasing author seniority and conventional quality indicators and is especially pronounced for Black authors. Moreover, papers authored by non-White scholars are less likely to serve as citation bridges and are less often cited by highly cited papers as measured by the centrality indexes, limiting both their direct and indirect influence. Our analysis indicates that this disparity is not attributable to differences in research quality, author ability, or visibility. Rather, it is largely driven by homophily in citation patterns and racial clusters in networks, where scholars tend to cite authors from their racial group. These findings can be rationalized by a simple theoretical model where citation costs and peer-review preferences influence citation behavior. Then, we provide suggestive evidence that reducing information friction—thereby lowering the cost of citing—could reduce the racial citation gap by up to 50%. Finally, using natural language processing, we highlight the complementarity across racial groups in research and discuss potential losses from racial barriers to idea diffusion.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33150,33150,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
Development Mismatch? Evidence from Agricultural Projects in Pastoral Africa,Eoin F. McGuirk & Nathan Nunn,"We study the consequences of a clash between contemporary development initiatives and traditional economic practices in Africa. Crop agriculture has expanded considerably across the continent in recent years. Much of this expansion has occurred in traditionally pastoral areas, where land is typically managed according to customary arrangements. This is believed to be a major cause of conflict between pastoral and agricultural ethnic groups. We test this hypothesis using geocoded data on agricultural development projects across Africa from 1995-2014. We find that implementing agricultural projects in traditionally pastoral areas leads to an almost two-fold increase in the risk of conflict. We find no equivalent effect for agricultural projects implemented in traditionally agricultural areas, nor for non-agricultural projects implemented in either location. We also find that this mechanism contributes to the spread of extremist-religious conflict in the form of jihadist attacks. The effects are muted when agricultural projects are paired with pastoral projects. This is more likely to occur when pastoral groups have more political power. Despite these effects on conflict, we find that crop agriculture projects increase nighttime luminosity in both agricultural and pastoral areas. Evidence from survey data suggests that the gains in pastoral areas are concentrated in non-pastoral households. Our findings indicate that ""development mismatch""---i.e., imposing projects that are misaligned with local populations---can be costly.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33191,33191,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
r-g before and after the Great Wars 1507-2023,Kenneth S. Rogoff & Paul Schmelzing,"We present new long-run samples of r-g series over centuries for key economies in the international financial system. Across a wide variety of econometric approaches, and including duration-matched constructions, we demonstrate strong evidence of trend stationarity in these series. Although we confirm trend stationarity, we find robust evidence of a major structural break in the first third of the 20th century. A multi-century downward trend in r-g appears to have levelled off in the years around 1930, and since then r-g has shown high volatility coupled with clear upwards pressure: notably, though real interest rates may still appear favorably low, aggregate growth rates are drifting downwards in advanced economies since the interwar period, creating secular pressures on r-g and debt sustainability. Our results stand in contrast to much recent literature and suggest the need for much more caution in assuming benign trends in global public debt sustainability. At the same time, when adding riskier elements of capital returns, the data lend support for structurally increasing ""dynamic efficiency"". We then associate the key 1930s inflection to the establishment and growth of welfare states in advanced economies, and the surge in non-defense, non-interest expenditures.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33202,33202,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024

Why Has Construction Productivity Stagnated? The Role of Land-Use Regulation,"Leonardo D'Amico, Edward L. Glaeser, Joseph Gyourko, William R. Kerr & Giacomo A.M. Ponzetto","We document a Kuznets curve for construction productivity in 20th-century America. Homes built per construction worker remained stagnant between 1900 and 1940, boomed after World War II, and then plummeted after 1970. The productivity boom from 1940 to 1970 shows that nothing makes technological progress inherently impossible in construction. What stopped it? We present a model in which local land-use controls limit the size of building projects. This constraint reduces the equilibrium size of construction companies, reducing both scale economies and incentives to invest in innovation. Our model shows that, in a competitive industry, such inefficient reductions in firm size and technology investment are a distinctive consequence of restrictive project regulation, while classic regulatory barriers to entry increase firm size. The model is consistent with an extensive series of key facts about the nature of the construction sector. The post-1970 productivity decline coincides with increases in our best proxies for land-use regulation. The size of development projects is small today and has declined over time. The size of construction firms is also quite small, especially relative to other goods-producing firms, and smaller builders are less productive. Areas with stricter land use regulation have particularly small and unproductive construction establishments. Patenting activity in construction stagnated and diverged from other sectors. A back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that, if half of the observed link between establishment size and productivity is causal, America’s residential construction firms would be approximately 60 percent more productive if their size distribution matched that of manufacturing.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33188,33188,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024

Sticky Inflation: Monetary Policy when Debt Drags Inflation Expectations,"Saki Bigio, Nicolas Caramp & Dejanir Silva","We append the expectation of a monetary-fiscal reform into a standard New Keynesian model. If a reform occurs, monetary policy will temporarily aid debt sustainability through a temporary burst in inflation. The anticipation of a possible reform links debt levels with inflation expectations. As a result, interest rates have two effects: they influence demand and affect expected inflation in opposite directions. The expectations effect is linked to the impact of interest rates on public debt. While lowering inflation in the short term is possible through demand control, inflation tends to rise again due to its impact on inflation expectations (sticky inflation). Optimal monetary policy may allow low real interest rates after fiscal shocks, temporarily breaking away from the Taylor principle. We assess whether the Federal Reserve's “staying behind the curve” was the right strategy during the recent post-pandemic inflation surge.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33190,33190,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024

Building on William Whyte's observational work from 1980, where he manually recorded pedestrian behaviors, we employ computer vision and deep learning techniques to examine video footage from 1979-80 and 2008-10. Our analysis measures changes in walking speed, lingering behavior, group sizes, and group formation. We find that the average walking speed has increased by 15%, while the time spent lingering in these spaces has halved across all locations. Although the percentage of pedestrians walking alone remained relatively stable (from 67% to 68%), the frequency of group encounters declined, indicating fewer interactions in public spaces. This shift suggests that urban residents increasingly view streets as thoroughfares rather than as social spaces, which has important implications for the role of public spaces in fostering social engagement.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33185,33185,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
How Institutions Interact with Exchange Rates After the 2024 US Presidential Election: New High-Frequency Evidence,Joshua Aizenman & Jamel Saadaoui,"This paper is a case study of the exchange rate adjustments during the first week following the swapping US election results. We compute three measures of exchange rate depreciation: the maximum depreciation during the 1st trading day after November 6 UTC 0:00 to capture the reaction on the FOREX immediately after the news for our sample of 73 currencies against the USD, practically all currencies depreciated sharply at the news.  Second, the depreciation after 4 days to capture the reaction of monetary authorities and the global markets to the news; third, the depreciation 1 week after the shock to observe whether some countries have experienced a further depreciation or a return to the pre-shock exchange rate level. In 26 countries out of a sample of 73 bilateral exchange rates against the US Dollar, the depreciation after 1 week was even more pronounced than just after the election.  We also find that the correlation between the depreciation rate after a week from the initial news and the ICRG institutional score is positive and significant at the 1 percent level. A multivariate regression for exchange rate movements indicates that after a week, the bilateral trade surplus with the US, and better institutional scores are associated with stronger depreciations. Exchange rate interventions have helped to stabilize the currencies at all time horizons. The exposure to policy changes, measured by EIU’s Trump Risk Index seems to be at play after 4 days.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33193,33193,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024

"Household Saving in Japan: The Past, Present, and Future",Charles Yuji Horioka,"This paper explores the determinants of the level of, and trends over time in, Japan’s household saving rate, with emphasis on the impact of the age structure of the population, and makes projections about future trends therein. The paper finds that Japan’s household saving rate has not always been high either absolutely or relative to other countries and that it was only during the 1961-86 period that it exceeded 15%. Past and future trends in Japan’s household saving rate can largely be explained by changes in the age structure of her population, but declines in the saving rate of retired elderly households is a more important explanation for the recent decline in the household saving rate. However, it is likely that other factors such as the unavailability of consumer credit, the unavailability of social safety nets, high rates of economic (income) growth, tax breaks for saving, saving promotion policies, and high and rising land and housing prices are also partial explanations for why Japan’s household saving rate was so high during the 1961-86 period and why it declined so much subsequently. Finally, we project that Japan’s household saving rate will fall even further though not necessarily at a rapid rate.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33181,33181,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
Gender-Based Violence in Schools and Girls’ Education: Experimental Evidence from Mozambique,"Sofia Amaral, Aixa Garcia-Ramos, Selim Gulesci, Alejandra Ramos, Sarita P. Ore-Quispe & Maria Micaela Sviatschi","Gender-based violence (GBV) at schools is a pervasive problem that affects millions of adolescent girls worldwide. In partnership with the Ministry of Education in Mozambique, we developed an intervention to increase the capacity of key school personnel to address GBV and to improve students’ awareness as well as proactive behaviors. To understand the role of GBV on girls’ education, we randomized not only exposure to the intervention but also whether the student component was targeted to girls only, boys only, or both. Our findings indicate a reduction in sexual violence by teachers and school staff against girls, regardless of the targeted gender group, providing evidence of the role of improving the capacity of key school personnel to deter perpetrators. Using administrative records, we also find that in schools where the intervention encouraged proactive behavior by girls, there was an increase in their school enrollment, largely due to an increased propensity for GBV reporting by victims. Our findings suggest that effectively mitigating violence to improve girls’ schooling requires a dual approach: deterring potential perpetrators and fostering a proactive stance among victims, such as increased reporting.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33203,33203,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
"Fintech, Visual Attention, and Financial Inclusion: A Field Experiment on Migrant Remittances","Eduardo Nakasone, Máximo Torero & Angelino Viceisza","Migrant remittances are significant but remain relatively costly to send. Policymakers have argued that fintech, specifically, comparison websites like kayak.com but for sending money, can boost financial inclusion and reduce remittance prices. Yet, little is known about how migrants with limited education and trust in digital methods interact with fintech. We conduct a field experiment on a comparison website and vary remittance-company attributes shown to migrants, specifically, the time for delivery and customer reviews. We use visual attention data to explore search. We find that (1) while 10-28 percent of migrants exhibit some type of remittance habit, more than half experiment with companies once provided with fintech information; (2) while migrant response to information is rational and search seems targeted, there is considerable heterogeneity—those with low prior awareness of comparison sites, financial literacy, or information-processing capability are less responsive to fintech; and (3) when presented with fintech information, migrants are 44 percent more likely to behave counter to the preferences over attributes they exhibit outside of the study. As such, they pay 20-30 percent more despite typically shopping around for the cheapest company. The findings suggest a nuanced potential for fintech to improve financial inclusion and consumer welfare.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33183,33183,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
The Rise of E-Wallet Super-Apps and Buy-Now-Pay-Later,"Wenlong Bian, Lin William Cong & Yang Ji","The rise of super-app digital wallets provides not only a conduit to banks but also internal payment options, including Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL). We examine, for the first time, transactions matched with merchant and consumer information, from a leading e-wallet super-app, and complement the analyses with a randomized experiment. We document that BNPL serves as a dominant form of “digital cash” and expands payment and credit access to underserved consumers without increasing indebtedness or delinquencies despite their spending more. The findings crucially depend on the cross-sale capacity and inherent disciplinary incentives of super-app ecosystems. Our findings underscore the synergy between credit and payments and provide novel insights for economies transitioning to cashless via super-app-driven platforms, where FinTech credit sees the greatest potential.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33178,33178,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
Assortative Matching and Wages: The Role of Selection,Katarína Borovičková & Robert Shimer,"We develop a random search model with two-sided heterogeneity and match-specific productivity shocks to explain why high-productivity workers tend to work at high-productivity firms despite low-productivity workers gaining about as much from such matches. Our model has two key predictions: i) the average log wage that a worker receives is increasing in the worker's and employer's productivity, with low-productivity workers gaining proportionally more at high-productivity firms and ii) there is assortative matching between a worker's productivity and that of her employer. Selective job acceptance drives these patterns. All workers are equally likely to meet all firms, but workers have higher surplus from meeting firms of similar productivity. The high surplus meetings result in matches more frequently, generating assortative matching. Only the subset of meetings that result in matches are observed in administrative wage data, shaping wages. We show that our findings are quantitatively consistent with recent empirical results. Moreover, we prove this selection is not detected using standard empirical approaches, highlighting the importance of theory-guided empirical work. Our results imply that encouraging high-wage firms to hire low-wage workers may be less effective at reducing wage inequality than wage patterns suggest.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33184,33184,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
Adverse Selection and (un)Natural Monopoly in Insurance Markets,"Edward Kong, Timothy Layton & Mark Shepard","Adverse selection is a classic market failure known to limit or “unravel”' trade in high-quality insurance and many other economic settings. While the standard theory emphasizes quality distortions, we argue that selection has another big-picture implication: it unravels competition among differentiated firms, leading to fewer surviving competitors—and in the extreme, what we call “un-natural” monopoly. Adverse selection pushes firms toward aggressive price cutting to attract price-sensitive, low-risk consumers. This creates a wedge between average and marginal costs that (like fixed costs in standard models) limits how may firms can profitably survive. We demonstrate this insight in a simple model of insurer entry and price competition, estimated using administrative data from Massachusetts' health insurance exchange. We find a large “selection wedge” of 20-30% of average costs, which (without corrective policies) unravels the market to monopoly.  Our analysis suggests a surprising policy implication: interventions that limit price-cutting can improve welfare by supporting more entry, and ultimately lower prices.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33187,33187,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
Using Stock Price Movements to Estimate the Harm from Anticompetitive Drug Patent Litigation Settlements,Keith M. Drake & Thomas McGuire,"Drug patent litigation settlements containing brand-to-generic “reverse payments” are a decades old antitrust concern that has been estimated to cost drug purchasers billions of dollars per year.  Most estimates of the harm rely on the Federal Trade Commission’s calculation that such payments delay generic entry by 17 months, which is based on 15-20-year-old data.  This paper takes a different approach, using stock price movements to quantify the harm.  Costs to purchasers from an anticompetitive agreement are approximately equal to the brand firm’s increase in profits.  If new profits are capitalized into stock prices, the change in value upon a settlement announcement can be used to estimate the new profit flows.  We assembled a list of 64 settlements announced during 2014-2023.  Although the announcements did not describe explicit forms of reverse payment, 16 announcements described terms that may transfer value to the generic firms.  We classified these settlements as having an indication of reverse payment.  Consistent with prior research, settlement announcements with no indication of reverse payment had no significant effect on the stock prices of brand firms implying that they tended to meet traders’ expectations.  Stock prices increased by approximately 3.5%, on average, after settlements with indication of reverse payment, implying they increased brand profits by delaying generic entry.  We estimate that these increases correspond to a total increase in purchaser spending of $2.9-$3.0 billion per year.  Because our sample is not a full census of settlements, the industry-wide increase in spending may be closer to $7 billion per year.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33196,33196,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
Flexible Pay and Labor Supply: Evidence from Uber’s Instant Pay,"M. Keith Chen, Katherine Feinerman & Kareem Haggag","Modern tech platforms provide workers real-time control over when they work, and increasingly, flexible pay: the option to be paid immediately after work. We investigate the labor supply effects of pay flexibility and the implications of present-biased preferences among gig-economy workers. Using granular data from a nationwide randomized controlled trial at Uber, we estimate the effects of switching from a fixed weekly pay schedule to Instant Pay, a system that allows on-demand, within-day withdrawals. We find that flexible pay substantially increased drivers’ work time. Furthermore, consistent with present bias, the response is significantly higher when drivers are further away from the end of their counterfactual weekly pay cycle. We discuss welfare and broader implications in contexts in which workers have the ability to flexibly supply labor.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33177,33177,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
Liquidity Traps: A Unified Theory of the Great Depression and Great Recession,Gauti B. Eggertsson & Sergey K. Egiev,"This paper presents a unified framework to explain three major economic downturns: the U.S. Great Depression, the U.S. Great Recession, and Japan’s Long Recession. Temporary economic disruptions, such as banking crises and excessive debt accumulation, can drive natural interest rates into negative territory in the short term. At the same time, structural factors, including demographic decline and rising inequality, can depress natural interest rates over short and long horizons. A negative natural interest rate and the zero lower bound (ZLB) are necessary conditions for a liquidity trap. Credible monetary policy can counteract the adverse effects of short-run liquidity traps. Diminished monetary policy credibility or persistent negative natural rates may necessitate fiscal interventions. The framework sheds light on the macroeconomic challenges of low-interest-rate environments and underscores the central importance of \textit{policy regimes}. We close by reflecting on the great macroeconomic question of our time: Will short-term interest rates collapse back to zero once the inflation surge of the 2020s moves to the back mirror and the political landscape in the US has dramatically changed?",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33195,33195,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
Taxing the Wealth of the Poor: Evidence from the Danish Old-Age Support Asset Test,"Niels Johannesen, Johan Sæverud & Emmanuel Saez","This paper provides evidence that asset testing of social transfers substantially depresses the liquid wealth of the poor. Our setting is Denmark where the low-income elderly receive an annual payment (around $3,000) if their end-of-year liquid wealth is below a threshold (around $15,000). Using administrative data on income and wealth for the full population, we document that the wealth density distribution of the low-income elderly exhibits large but diffuse excess mass below the wealth threshold: The fraction with wealth between 50% and 100% of the wealth threshold is twice as high as for ineligible control groups who are slightly younger or have slightly higher income. A reform analysis supports a causal interpretation: excess mass below the threshold emerges around the introduction of the program and shifts when the threshold is increased discretely. The excess mass remains when we rely solely on third-party reported data to measure liquid wealth and therefore does not reflect strategic misreporting by the recipients. Finally, analyzing bank customer data with monthly information about wealth, spending and cash withdrawals shows that the excess mass largely reflects permanently lower levels of liquid wealth rather than temporary responses around the end of the year.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33189,33189,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024
The Economics of Net Zero Banking,Adair Morse & Parinitha R. Sastry,"Banks have voluntarily committed to align their lending portfolios with a net zero path toward a decarbonized economy. In this review, we explore the economic channels for why portfolio decarbonization might be consistent with lender profit maximization. We frame the question by positing that net zero lending may create differential value through the channels of risk and returns, where return topics span profit margins and lending book growth arguments. We then use the lens of the frame to survey the literature and speak to gaps in research knowledge. We uncover multiple roles for risk arguments influencing decarbonization. Moreover, decarbonization and green investment are tied to enhanced profitability through bank lending growth. Yet, the literature has many dots yet to connect. We suggest that future work may draw further connections between the literature in climate finance and the broader literature in banking, to enhance our understanding of the role that banks will play in the net zero transition.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33148,33148,November 2024,NBER,11/25/2024

Testing for Endogeneity: A Moment-Based Bayesian Approach,"Siddhartha Chib, Minchul Shin, Anna Simoni","A standard assumption in the Bayesian estimation of linear regression models is that the regressors are exogenous in the sense that they are uncorrelated with the model error term. In practice, however, this assumption can be invalid. In this paper, under the rubric of the exponentially tilted empirical likelihood, we develop a Bayes factor test for endogeneity that compares a base model that is correctly specified under exogeneity but misspecified under endogeneity against an extended model that is correctly specified in either case. We provide a comprehensive study of the log-marginal exponentially tilted empirical likelihood. We demonstrate that our testing procedure is consistent from a frequentist point of view: As the sample becomes large, it almost surely selects the base model if and only if the regressors are exogenous, and the extended model if and only if the regressors are endogenous. The methods are illustrated with simulated data and problems concerning the causal effect of automobile prices on automobile demand and the causal effect of potentially endogenous airplane ticket prices on passenger volume.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/macroeconomics/testing-for-endogeneity-a-moment-based-bayesian-approach,24-19,November 2024,FED-PHILADELPHIA,11/26/2024
The Problem of Quality Change in Historical Price Statistics: An Illustrative Example Using Baedeker Travel Guides,"Jarod Coulter, Braden Strackman and Mark A. Wynne","The problem of accurately measuring inflation in the face of constant improvement in the quality of goods is a long-standing one in economics. This paper uses a novel dataset on the prices of the travel guidebooks published by the German publishing house Baedeker between 1832 and 1944 to construct a hedonic price index for guidebooks. Comparing these indexes to the list prices of these guidebooks, we show that the failure to adjust for improvements in the quality of the guidebooks over time imparts a substantial upward bias to measured inflation. For example, for German-language guidebooks, nominal prices increased 76 percentage points more than quality-adjusted prices between 1843–1913, suggesting an average upward bias over this period of 1.1 percentage points a year. Similarly, we find substantial average upwards bias of 1.5 and 1.7 percentage points a year for French-language guidebooks over 1859–1913 and English-language guidebooks over 1868–1913, respectively.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2415.pdf,2415,"November 20, 2024",FED-DALLAS,11/27/2024
The Long-Term Rise of Labor Market Detachment: Evidence from Local Labor Markets,Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz,"We develop a measure of chronic joblessness among prime-age men and women in the United States—termed the detachment rate— that identifies those who have been out of the labor force for more than a year. We show that the detachment rate more than doubled for men since the early 1980s and rose by a quarter for women since 2000, though it is consistently considerably higher for women than men. We then explore the economic geography of labor market detachment to help explain its rise. Results show that the detachment rate increased more in places with weak local economies, particularly those that experienced a loss of routine production and administrative support jobs due to globalization and technological change. The loss of production jobs affected both men and women and was particularly consequential in the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s, while the loss of administrative support jobs mostly affected women and was particularly severe in the 1980s and 1990s. Moreover, we find the rise in detachment was concentrated among older prime-age individuals and those without a college degree, and occurred less in places with high human capital.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1138,1138,2024-11-21,FED-NEWYORK,11/27/2024
Real Exchange Rates and the Global Financial Cycle,"Appendix
 

  J. Scott Davis and Andrei Zlate","This paper looks at the effect of fluctuations in the global financial cycle on real exchange rates (RER). We show that, on average, a downturn in the global financial cycle leads to RER depreciation relative to the U.S. dollar. However, quantitatively there is considerable heterogeneity in the RER responses among advanced, emerging and developing economies; between net creditor and net debtor countries; and also over time. Prior to 2007, the global financial cycle had less effect on advanced than on emerging market economies' RER, whereas post-2007 the effect was about the same in the two groups of countries. Finally, we decompose the RER changes into changes in the nominal exchange rate and changes in aggregate price levels. We find that in advanced economies, nearly all RER adjustment occurred through nominal exchange rates throughout the sample period. In the emerging and developing economies, the RER adjustment was mixed prior to 2007, when changes in the RER were driven by both nominal exchange rate changes and inflation differentials, whereas nominal exchange rate adjustments dominated post-2007.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2416.pdf,2416,"November 22, 2024",FED-DALLAS,11/27/2024
Revisiting Risky Money,Travis D. Nesmith,"Risk was first incorporated into monetary aggregation over thirty-five years ago, using a stochastic version of the workhorse money-in-the-utility-function model. Nevertheless, the mathematical foundations of this stochastic model remain shaky. To firm the foundations, this paper employs a slightly richer probability concept than standard Borel-measurability, which enables me to prove the existence of a well-behaved solution and to derive stochastic Euler equations. This measurability approach is long-established albeit less common in economics, possibly because the derivation of stochastic Euler equations is new. Importantly, the problem’s economics are not restricted by the approach. Consequently, the results provide firm footing for the growing monetary aggregation under risk literature, which integrates monetary and finance theory. As crypto-currencies and stable coins garner more attention, solidifying the foundations of risky money becomes more critical. The method also supports deriving stochastic Euler equations for any dynamic economics problem that features contemporaneous uncertainty about prices, including asset pricing models like capm and stochastic consumer choice models.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/revisiting-risky-money.htm,2024-090,November 2024,FED-BOARD,11/27/2024

Consumer Learning and Price Index Bias: How Diffusion of Product Quality Knowledge Impacts Measures of Price Change,Daniel Ripperger-Suhler,"There is a general consensus that the bias associated with the entry of new merchants has nontrivial implications for measuring inflation. However, quantifying the bias empirically has proven difficult in part because little is known about how much of the price differences in goods sold by new versus old merchants represents a pure price difference (inflation) or differences in the quality of the attendant services (quality differences). In the public transportation industry, measurement of quality is complicated by the accompanying technological change rideshare services represented. As with any completely new technology, consumers faced considerable uncertainty around the quality of rideshare services. Consequently, consumers' perceived quality of rideshare services changes over time, which makes the calculation of constant-quality price indexes even more challenging. This paper explores a new method for accounting for this bias by separately identifying changes in product price and quality over time. I estimate multiple hedonic models to recover quality adjustment factors for quality-adjusted unit value price indexes. One of these models utilizes measures of time-varying product quality that are derived from a structural demand model of endogenous consumer learning that explicitly models the diffusion of knowledge about the quality of rideshare services. I compare the measurement of quality and pure price differences across modes of transportation, and the implications they have for constant-quality price indexes and, consequently, the measurement of inflation.",https://www.bea.gov//research/papers/2024/consumer-learning-and-price-index-bias-how-diffusion-product-quality-knowledge,WP2024-7,2024-11-26,BEA,11/27/2024
Rate-Based Emissions Trading with Overlapping Policies: Insights from Theory and an Application to China,"Carolyn Fischer, Chenfei Qu & Lawrence H. Goulder","Jurisdictions employing emissions trading systems (ETSs) to control emissions often utilize other environmental or energy policies as well, including policies to support renewable energy and reduce energy consumption. Interactions with these other policies lead to different outcomes from what might be predicted by examining the policies separately. The prior literature considering policy interactions has focused mainly on the case where the ETS is cap and trade. This paper extends the literature by examining the outcomes under a wide range of ETSs (including several forms of tradable performance standards) and overlapping policies (including various renewable subsidies and electricity consumption taxes). An analytical model demonstrates that the impacts of overlapping policies on allowance prices, emissions, and electricity output depend critically on the nature of the ETS. A numerical general equilibrium model tailored to China’s economy explores the implications for the cost-effectiveness of emissions reductions. Results indicate that overlapping policies that reduce cost-effectiveness under cap and trade can significantly enhance cost-effectiveness under tradable performance standards. The model predicts that under the current and planned designs for China’s ETS, which sets differentiated tradable performance standards for emitters, implementing renewable portfolio standards and accounting for indirect emissions from electricity consumption are both beneficial. Together they can reduce the cost of achieving the national emissions target by 20-30 percent over the interval 2020-2035. Transitioning to uniform benchmarks for emitting power generators could save another 10-15 percent. The findings highlight the importance of coordinating the designs of emissions trading systems with the overlapping policies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33197,33197,December 2024,NBER,12/02/2024

The End of Oil,Ryan Kellogg,"It is now plausible to envision scenarios in which global demand for crude oil falls to essentially zero by the end of this century, driven by improvements in clean energy technologies, adoption of stringent climate policies, or both. This paper asks what such a demand decline, when anticipated, might mean for global oil supply. One possibility is the well-known “green paradox”: because oil is an exhaustible resource, producers may accelerate near-term extraction in order to beat the demand decline. This reaction would increase near-term CO2 emissions and could possibly even lead the total present value of climate damages to be greater than if demand had not declined at all. However, because oil extraction requires potentially long-lived investments in wells and other infrastructure, the opposite may occur: an anticipated demand decline reduces producers' investment rates, decreasing near-term oil production and CO2 emissions. To evaluate whether this disinvestment effect outweighs the green paradox, or vice-versa, I develop a tractable model of global oil supply that incorporates both effects, while also capturing industry features such as heterogeneous producers, exercise of market power by low-cost OPEC producers, and marginal drilling costs that increase with the rate of drilling. I find that for model inputs with the strongest empirical support, the disinvestment effect outweighs the traditional green paradox. In order for anticipation effects on net to substantially increase cumulative global oil extraction, I find that industry investments must have short time horizons, and that producers must have discount rates that are comparable to U.S. treasury bill rates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33207,33207,December 2024,NBER,12/02/2024

"Dispersed Information, Nominal Rigidities and Monetary Business Cycles: A Hayekian Perspective",Christian Hellwig & Venky Venkateswaran,"We study the propagation of nominal shocks in a dispersed information economy where firms learn from and respond to information generated by their activities in product and factor markets. We prove the existence of a “Hayekian benchmark”, defined by conditions under which imperfect information has no effect on equilibrium outcomes. This occurs under fairly general conditions when prices are flexible, i.e. without nominal frictions, informational frictions are irrelevant. With sticky prices, however, this irrelevance obtains only if there are no strategic complementarities in pricing and aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks are equally persistent. With complementarities and/or differences in persistence, the interaction of nominal and informational frictions slows down price adjustment, amplifying real effects from nominal shocks (relative to a full information model with only nominal frictions). In a calibrated model, the amplification is most pronounced over the medium to long term. In the short run, market generated information leads to substantial aggregate price adjustment, even though firms may be completely unaware of changes in aggregate conditions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33215,33215,December 2024,NBER,12/02/2024
Financial Conditions Targeting,"Ricardo J. Caballero, Tomás E. Caravello & Alp Simsek","We present evidence that noisy financial flows influence financial conditions and macroeconomic activity. How should monetary policy respond to this noise? We develop a model where it is optimal for the central bank to target and (partially) stabilize financial conditions beyond their direct effect on output and inflation gaps, even though stable financial conditions are not a social objective per se. In our model, noise affects both financial conditions and macroeconomic activity, and arbitrageurs are reluctant to trade against noise due to aggregate return volatility. Our main result shows that Financial Conditions Index (FCI) targeting—announcing a (soft and temporary) FCI target and setting the policy rate in the near future to maintain the actual FCI close to the target—reduces the FCI volatility and stabilizes the output gap. This improvement occurs because a more predictable FCI enables arbitrageurs to trade more aggressively against noise shocks, thereby ""recruiting"" them to insulate FCI from financial noise. FCI targeting is similar to providing forward guidance about the FCI, and in our framework it is strictly superior to providing forward guidance about the policy interest rate. Finally, we extend recent policy counterfactual methods to incorporate our model's endogenous risk reduction mechanism and apply it to U.S. data. We estimate that FCI targeting could have reduced the variance of the output gap, inflation, and interest rates by 36%, 2%, and 6%, respectively, and decreased the conditional variance of the FCI by 55%. When compared with interest rate forward guidance, it would have reduced output gap variance by 21%. We also show that a significant share of the gains from FCI targeting can be attained by an augmented version of a Taylor rule that gives a large weight to a simplified financial conditions target.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33206,33206,December 2024,NBER,12/02/2024
"Subsidizing Medical Spending through the Tax Code: Take-Up, Targeting and the Cost of Claiming",Gopi Shah Goda,"The U.S. tax code partially subsidizes out-of-pocket medical spending as itemized medical deductions (IMDs).  In this paper, using detailed information in the Health and Retirement Study, I find that while a substantial share of medical spending among older Americans is deducted through the tax code, take-up is incomplete: 61.8 (50.5) percent of potential tax savings (deductions) are claimed, resulting in lost tax savings of $5.4 billion annually.  Further, frictions in take-up result in diverting tax savings from higher-need populations.  I investigate potential mechanisms and estimate a discrete choice model to simulate eligibility, take-up and the implied cost of claiming under different policy counterfactuals.  The results indicate that subsidizing medical expenses through the tax code imposes significant economic burdens, reducing the net subsidy available to taxpayers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33213,33213,December 2024,NBER,12/02/2024
Predicting College Closures and Financial Distress,"Robert J. Kelchen, Dubravka Ritter & Douglas A. Webber","In this paper, we assemble the most comprehensive dataset to date on the characteristics of colleges and universities, including dates of operation, institutional setting, student body, staff, and finance data from 2002 to 2023. We provide an extensive description of what is known and unknown about closed colleges compared with institutions that did not close. Using this data, we first develop a series of predictive models of financial distress, utilizing factors like operational revenue/expense patterns, sources of revenue, metrics of liquidity and leverage, enrollment/staff patterns, and prior signs of significant financial strain. We benchmark these models against existing federal government screening mechanisms such as financial responsibility scores and heightened cash monitoring. We document a high degree of missing data among colleges that eventually close and show that this is a key impediment to identifying at risk institutions. We then show that modern machine learning techniques, combined with richer data, are far more effective at predicting college closures than linear probability models, and considerably more effective than existing accountability metrics. Our preferred model, which combines an off-the-shelf machine learning algorithm with the richest set of explanatory variables, can significantly improve predictive accuracy even for institutions with complete data, but is particularly helpful for predicting instances of financial distress for institutions with spotty data. Finally, we conduct simulations using our estimates to contemplate likely increases in future closures, showing that enrollment challenges resulting from an impending demographic cliff are likely to significantly increase annual college closures for reasonable scenarios.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33216,33216,December 2024,NBER,12/02/2024
Painful Bargaining: Evidence from Anesthesia Rollups,"Aslihan Asil, Paulo Ramos, Amanda Starc & Thomas G.

Increasingly, this strategy is shaping economically important markets, but historically, it has escaped antitrust enforcement. We study this phenomenon in the anesthesia industry, site of the first rollup-based antitrust case in US history. First, we identify 18 other rollups that are observationally similar to the litigated ones.

Unresolved Conflict in Workers' Compensation: The Impact of Legal Representation on Workers' Compensation Benefits,Bogdan Savych & David Neumark,"We estimate the causal effect of attorney involvement on the indemnity benefits workers receive after their injuries. To address the fundamental challenge that claims and injuries may differ on unmeasured dimensions that affect both attorney involvement and benefits received, we propose and use two instruments. The first is the baseline local area attorney involvement rate derived from a subset of claims for fractures, lacerations, and contusions without permanent partial disability and/or lump-sum payments. The second instrument is a delay in the first indemnity payment. Our outcome is the total indemnity benefits that workers receive after their injuries, which captures payments to workers for time lost from work and other adverse effects of an injury. Our analysis of more than 950,000 claims with more than seven days of lost time indicates that attorney involvement substantially increases total indemnity benefits paid to workers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33210,33210,December 2024,NBER,12/02/2024
FinTech Platforms and Asymmetric Network Effects: Theory and Evidence from Marketplace Lending,"Lin William Cong, Ke Tang, Danxia Xie & Weiyi Zhao","We conceptually identify and empirically verify using marketplace lending data the features distinguishing FinTech platforms from non-financial platforms: (i) Long-term contracts introducing default risk at both the individual and platform levels; (ii) Lenders’ investment diversification to mitigate individual default risk; (iii) Platform-level default risk leading to greater asymmetric user stickiness and rendering platform-level cross-side network effects (p-CNEs), a novel metric we introduce, crucial for adoption and market dynamics. We incorporate these features into a model of two-sided FinTech platform with potential failures and endogenous participation/fees. The model predicts lenders’ single-homing, occasional lower fees for borrowers, asymmetric p-CNEs, and the predictive power of lenders’ p-CNEs in forecasting platform failures. Marketplace lending in China empirically corroborate our model predictions in this dynamic industry characterized by entries, exits, and network externalities. Specifically, lenders’ p-CNEs are empirically lower on declining or more established platforms compared to growing or new ones. Moreover, lenders’ p-CNEs predict platforms’ survival likelihood among others, even at very early stages. Our findings provide novel economic insights on multi-sided FinTech platforms for both practitioners and regulators.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33173,33173,December 2024,NBER,12/02/2024

In the experiment, a non-profit gifted 1,000 low-income Americans $1,000 per month for three years tax-free, and 2,000 control participants $50 monthly. Contrary to resource models of participation, we find no effects on political participation or engagement, and rule out effects equivalent to the observational association between turnout and income. Political preferences largely do not change, with the estimates again distinguishable from the observational relationship that economic conservatism increases with income. Dispositions such as trust in government, polarization, and support for democracy also do not change. We do find effects consistent with mood misattribution: affect towards one's own racial group, other racial groups, and some politicians slightly improves. There is also some evidence that treated participants saw work as more important for individuals, society, or even as a requirement for accessing government programs; qualitative evidence illuminates potential mechanisms. Our findings contrast with findings from other economic shocks such as government-sponsored or taxable transfers—thereby helping clarify the mechanisms likely responsible for their effects—and underscore the durability of political predispositions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33214,33214,December 2024,NBER,12/02/2024
From Novelty to Norm: Uncovering the Drivers of Virtual Tour Effectiveness in Real Estate Sales,Miremad Soleymanian & Yi Qian,"This study examines the effectiveness of virtual tours and digital marketing strategies in enhancing real estate sales using a unique dataset combining MLS data, government-assessed property values, and agents’ marketing activities. While virtual tours are often perceived as a powerful tool to boost sales, their impact is context-dependent. Using classical econometric models and causal machine learning techniques, we find that virtual tours increase property sale prices by an average of 1%. However, the effect has declined over time, particularly post-COVID, indicating a shift from being a novel feature to a standard practice. Further analysis using causal random forests reveals significant heterogeneity in their effectiveness across property attributes, market conditions, and agent characteristics. Virtual tours are less impactful for highly differentiated properties but more beneficial in competitive markets and for less experienced agents who lack familiarity with the local market. These results suggest that real estate agents may benefit from considering property features, market dynamics, and their own experience when deciding how to use virtual tours. Our findings offer valuable insights for practitioners looking to optimize digital marketing strategies and enhance sales performance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33204,33204,December 2024,NBER,12/02/2024

Corporate Debt Structure over the Global Credit Cycle,Nina Boyarchenko and Leonardo Elias,"We study the determinants of active debt management through issuance and refinancing decisions for firms around the world. We leverage instrument-level data to create a comprehensive picture of the maturity, currency, and security type composition of firms' debt for a large cross-section of countries. At the instrument level, we estimate a predictive model of prepayment as a function of interest costs savings and maturity lengthening motives. We document that there is substantial heterogeneity in prepayment across bonds and loans and across firms, depending on their reliance on bank lending. While debt prepayment is generally successful at extending average maturities and lowering interest rate costs at the firm level, these benefits appear smaller for issuers in emerging market economies. Tight global credit conditions reduce both the ability to prepay debt early and the effectiveness of debt refinancing in reducing interest costs and rollover risk. Put together, our results show that the impact of global credit conditions on firms' debt structure can be traced back to how instrument-level prepayment incentives change over the global credit cycle.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1139,1139,2024-12-05,FED-NEWYORK,12/06/2024
Measuring Inclusion: Gender and Coauthorship at the Federal Reserve Board,Deepa D. Datta and Robert J. Vigfusson,"Relative to diversity, inclusion is much harder to measure. We measure inclusion of women in economics using novel data on coauthoring relationships among Federal Reserve Board economists. Individual coauthoring relationships are voluntary, yet inclusion in coauthoring networks can be central to research productivity and career success. We document gender affinity in coauthoring, with individuals up to 34 percent more likely to have a same-gender coauthor in the data relative to what would be predicted by random assignment. Because women account for under 30 percent of Federal Reserve Board economists, gender affinity in coauthoring relationships may reduce research opportunities for women relative to their men peers. Whereas commonality of research interests is not sufficient to explain observed gender affinity in coauthoring, we find that paper outcomes may encourage gender affinity, in that papers authored by only men are more downloaded and more likely to be published than papers by mixed-gender teams. Gender affinity may contribute to the gender gap in authoring as well: women make up only 23 percent of authors in the later part of our sample, about 4 percentage points below their share of the economist population. We estimate that reducing gender affinity by men could eliminate between 1.5 to 3 percentage points of the gender gap in observed research output by women.

Middle-income countries typically regain access more quickly than low-income nations, with significant variation across historical periods. Key factors in influencing re-access include the occurrence of natural disasters prior to the default, the presence of an IMF program, the severity of investor losses, the country's economic outlook, and global liquidity conditions.

How do firms’ financial conditions influence the transmission of monetary policy? A non-parametric local projection approach,Livia Silva Paranhos,"By Livia Silva Paranhos

How do monetary policy shocks affect firm investment? This paper provides new evidence on US non-financial firms and a novel non-parametric framework based on random forests. The key advantage of the methodology is that it does not impose any assumptions on how the effect of shocks varies across firms thereby allowing for general forms of heterogeneity in the transmission of shocks. My estimates suggest that there exists a threshold in the level of firm risk above which monetary policy is much less effective. Additionally, there is no evidence that the effect of policy varies with firm risk for the 75% of firms in the sample with higher risk. The proposed methodology is a generalisation of local projections and nests several common local projection specifications, including linear and nonlinear.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/how-do-firms-financial-conditions-influence-the-transmission-of-monetary-policy,1100,"Fri, 06 Dec 2",BOE,12/07/2024

Inflation Disagreement Weakens the Power of Monetary Policy,"Ding Dong, Zheng Liu, Pengfei Wang, and Min Wei","We present empirical evidence that household inflation disagreement weakens the power of forward guidance and conventional monetary policy shocks. The attenuation effect is stronger when inflation forecasts are positively skewed and it is not driven by endogenous responses of inflation disagreement to contemporaneous shocks. These empirical observations can be rationalized by a model featuring heterogeneous beliefs about the central banks' inflation target. An agent who perceives higher future inflation also perceives a lower real interest rate and thus borrows more to finance consumption, subject to borrowing constraints. Higher inflation disagreement would lead to a larger share of borrowing-constrained agents, resulting in more sluggish responses of aggregate consumption to changes in current and expected future interest rates. This mechanism also provides a microeconomic foundation for Euler equation discounting that helps resolve the forward guidance puzzle.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/inflation-disagreement-weakens-the-power-of-monetary-policy.htm,2024-094,December 2024,FED-BOARD,12/07/2024
Why Aren't There More Minority Entrepreneurs?,Victor M. Bennett & David T. Robinson,"We study racial and gender disparities in entrepreneurial activity through the lens of a Roy model, focusing on the distinction between idea generation and execution. Using nationally representative sur-vey data, we find that Black and Hispanic individuals demonstrate higher entrepreneurial intentions than white respondents. They are much less likely, however, to launch ventures once ideas are conceived. A critical determinant of this gap is differential reliance on social networks, which shapes both the likelihood of launching a business as well as the reasons for stopping. Variation in the strength of local, own-group entrepreneurship reveals that stronger networks enhance the relationship between social engagement and business formation. Also, as predicted by the model, access to social networks also predicts seeking capital. The interconnections between socialization and searching for capital are important for understanding-policies aimed at boosting rates of entrepreneurship in underrepresented groups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33229,33229,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
"Halloween, ADHD, and Subjectivity in Medical Diagnosis","Christopher Worsham, Charles Bray & Anupam Jena","The practice of medicine relies on accurate diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of many medical conditions involves assessments that invite varying degrees of subjectivity. External and arbitrary factors can influence physicians’ diagnostic assessments in conditions ranging from heart attacks to neurodevelopmental conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Quantifying this subjectivity is challenging, however, particularly for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions where subjective assessments of behavior are common and important.  Halloween, a holiday characterized by excitement among children, could present a natural experiment to study subjectivity in diagnosis, if any ensuing behavioral changes influence diagnosis rates of ADHD.  Using data on over 100 million physician office visits, we compared ADHD diagnosis rates, by day, among children seen by physicians in the 10 weekdays surrounding seven Halloween holidays. The rate of new ADHD diagnosis was 62.7 per 10,000 child-visits on Halloween, compared with 55.1 during surrounding weekdays, a 14% increase. There were no increases in diagnoses of several neuropsychiatric disorders with diagnostic criteria that are less focused on hyperactive behavior. Our findings highlight subjectivity in ADHD diagnosis and support the need to consider external factors that may influence diagnosis.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33232,33232,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
A Market Interpretation of Treatment Effects,Robert Minton & Casey B. Mulligan,"Markets, likened to an invisible hand, often appear to contradict econometric assumptions that rule out spillovers of one person’s treatment on another’s outcomes.  This paper provides a simple statistical framework highlighting that controls are indirectly affected by the treatment through the market.  Further, the effect of the treatment on the treated reveals only part of the consequence for the treated of treating the entire market.  When combined with economic theory, our framework leads to a new application of Marshall’s Laws of Derived Demand that relates econometric estimates of treatment effects in the marketplace to the substitution and scale effects of demand theory.  We show how treatment-effect estimators can diverge – both in magnitude and direction – from the causal effects of treatment on the treated or counterfactual policies treating all market participants.  The framework shows how the consequences of targeted treatments reveal the effects of marketwide treatments, and the role of market frictions in that inference.

Growth and Fluctuations: An Overview,Joseph E. Stiglitz,"Capitalism since its inception has been marked by large fluctuations. The resulting episodic unemployment has been very costly. This paper provides an overview of alternative theories. Standard models (such as DSGE)  have not provided insights into the causes of the fluctuations and the shocks buffeting the economy, which contrary to what they assume, are largely endogenous; they have not provided an understanding of how and why the economy amplifies shocks and makes their effects at times so persistent or how and why there may be oscillatory behavior, rather than a smooth convergence back to some (temporary) equilibrium. Accordingly, they do not give guidance on how to make deep downturns—those that really matter—less frequent, shallower, and less costly. By contrast, there are alternative, new models, often building on older Keynesian foundations, with heterogenous capital goods and heterogeneous agents, interacting with each other in imperfect markets and fragile networks, with endogenous innovation in an ever-evolving economy, with deep uncertainty. These theories, with endogenously driven fluctuations, provide greater insights in the causes and nature of fluctuations, and better policy guidance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33218,33218,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024

"Search Costs, Intermediation, and Trade: Experimental Evidence from Ugandan Agricultural Markets","Lauren F. Bergquist, Craig McIntosh & Meredith Startz","We study the large-scale experimental rollout of a platform that reduced search and matching frictions in Ugandan agricultural markets by connecting buyers and sellers. Market integration improved substantially: trade increased and price gaps fell. Interpreting the experiment through a trade model, we estimate treatment effects accounting for equilibrium changes that impact control markets. The intervention reduced fixed trade costs by 21% and increased trade flows between treated markets by 6% and across all markets by 1%. Scale economies shaped engagement: few farmers used the platform, but equilibrium price convergence from improved arbitrage by larger traders passed through to farm revenue.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33221,33221,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
"Is Swedish Household Debt Too High? Solvency, Liquidity, and Debt-Financed Overconsumption",Lars E.O. Svensson,"Swedish authorities and international organizations that comment on Swedish economic policy have argued that household debt is too high and a threat to financial and macroeconomic stability (FMS). But household debt may become a threat to FMS under essentially three conditions: (1) Household debt becomes too high relative to household assets. (2) Households’ debt service becomes too high relative to incomes and payment capacity. (3) Households use home-equity withdrawals—made possible by rising house prices—to finance an unsustainable overconsumption of macroeconomic significance.
Two Swedish structural features mitigate the risks. First, mortgages are a safe cash cow for banks and contribute to financial stability. Second, the mortgage rates are not exogenous but indirectly controlled by the Riksbank, and it sets the policy rate to maintain FMS.
Regarding condition (1), aggregate household assets are much larger and have grown much faster than debt. Net wealth was twice the debt in 1985, five times in 2024. 78% of borrowers have home equity exceeding 30%, more than any housing price fall during the last 50 years. Regarding condition (2), debt service of borrowers is not high relative to incomes, because modest LTV ratios mean that required amortization rates are modest. Regarding condition (3), there is no indication of any debt-financed overconsumption (undersaving) of macroeconomic significance. HEW is not unusually high, the saving rate is at a historical high, and the share of durable consumption in total consumption expenditures is normal.
Thus, none of the three conditions is present. Swedish household debt is neither too high nor a threat to financial or macroeconomic stability.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33222,33222,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
A Theory of How Workers Keep Up With Inflation,"Hassan Afrouzi, Andrés Blanco, Andrés Drenik & Erik Hurst","In this paper, we develop a model that combines elements of modern macro labor theories with nominal wage rigidities to study the consequences of unexpected inflation on the labor market. The slow and costly adjustment of real wages within a match after a burst of inflation incentivizes workers to engage in job-to-job transitions. Such dynamics after a surge in inflation lead to a rise in aggregate vacancies relative to unemployment, associating a seemingly tight labor market with lower average real wages. Calibrating with pre-2020 data, we show the model can simultaneously match the trends in worker flows and wage changes during the 2021-2024 period. Using historical data, we further show that prior periods of high inflation were also associated with an increase in vacancies and an upward shift in the Beveridge curve. Finally, we show that other “hot labor market” theories that can cause an increase in the aggregate vacancy-to-unemployment rate have implications that are inconsistent with the worker flows and wage dynamics observed during the recent inflationary period. Collectively, our calibrated model implies that the recent inflation in the United States, all else equal, reduced the welfare of workers through real wage declines and other costly actions, providing a model-driven reason why workers report they dislike inflation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33233,33233,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
Business Applications as a Leading Economic Indicator?,"Jose Asturias, Emin Dinlersoz, John C. Haltiwanger, Rebecca J. Hutchinson & Alyson Plumb","How are applications to start new businesses related to aggregate economic activity? This paper explores the properties of three monthly business application series from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Formation Statistics as economic indicators: all business applications, business applications that are relatively likely to turn into new employer businesses (“likely employers”), and the residual series -- business applications that have a relatively low rate of becoming employers (“likely non-employers”). Growth in applications for likely employers significantly leads total nonfarm employment growth and has a strong positive correlation with it. Furthermore, growth in applications for likely employers leads growth in most of the monthly Principal Federal Economic Indicators (PFEIs). Motivated by our findings, we estimate a dynamic factor model (DFM) to forecast nonfarm employment growth over a 12-month period using the PFEIs and the likely employers series. The latter improves the model’s forecast, especially in the years following the turning points of the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, applications for likely employers are a strong leading indicator of monthly PFEIs and aggregate economic activity, whereas applications for likely non-employers provide early information about changes in increasingly prevalent self-employment activity in the U.S. economy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33224,33224,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
Careers and Wages in Family Firms: Evidence from Matched Employer-Employee Data,"Edoardo Di Porto, Marco Pagano, Vincenzo Pezone, Raffaele Saggio & Fabiano Schivardi","We investigate compensation policies in family and non-family firms using a novel employer-employee matched dataset comprising nearly the universe of Italian incorporated firms and ownership information. Family firms pay significantly lower wages and offer slower and less rewarding careers. Differences in worker sorting account for half of the wage gap while productivity differences and compensating differentials explain little of the residual gap. The wage distribution in family firms is more compressed, with infrequent promotions. We rationalize this evidence with a model where family owners seek to maintain control, creating a “glass ceiling” that limits their employees’ career progression.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33219,33219,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
Tearing the Paper Ceiling: The Impact of State Commitments to Remove Degree Requirements on Public Awareness and Job Opportunities for STARs,"Justin Heck, Blair Corcoran de Castillo, Peter Q. Blair & Papia Debroy","In the past two years, 25 states have enacted executive orders and legislation to reduce unnecessary degree requirements for public sector jobs, signaling a shift toward skill-based hiring. This paper examines the impact of these policy commitments on public perceptions, media coverage, and job posting practices in the time following their adoption. Our analysis reveals significant increases in public awareness of skill-based hiring concepts, such as the 'paper ceiling' (i.e., bachelor’s degree analog of the glass ceiling), and a notable decline in bachelor’s degree requirements in state government job postings. We estimate that degree requirements dropped by 2.5 percentage points for each additional year of policy exposure in states with commitments. These findings suggest that state policy commitments have expanded access to government jobs for workers skilled through alternative routes (STARs) other than the bachelor’s degree in keeping with the intended goals of the policies to broaden the talent pool for public sector hiring.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33220,33220,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
"Minimum Viable Signal: Venture Funding, Social Movements, and Race","Matt Marx, Qian Wang & Emmanuel Yimfor","How do venture capital investors react to social movements, including those that relate to historical underrepresentation in funding? We use image and name algorithms combined with clerical review to classify race for 150,000 founders and 30,000 investors. These data allow us to assess the impact of George Floyd’s murder on VC funding of Black entrepreneurs and identify which VCs were most responsive. Although VCs responded swiftly, investment in Black-founded startups reverted to prior levels within two years. This temporary reaction was concentrated among those who had never previously invested in any Black entrepreneur. Moreover, the investors who responded were less likely to invest in more than one Black-founded startup and were less inclined to engage deeply by taking a board seat. Finally, it appears that the best Black entrepreneurs may have anticipated this “token” response, as they did not match with investors who had no experience funding Black startups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33227,33227,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
"Household Responses to Guaranteed Income: Experimental Evidence from Compton, California","Sidhya Balakrishnan, Sewin Chan, Sara Constantino, Johannes Haushofer & Jonathan Morduch","We study the effects of a two-year unconditional cash transfer program for lowincome households in Compton, California between 2021 and 2023. 695 households were randomly assigned to receive transfers averaging about $500 per month over a two year period, with 1,402 households randomly assigned to a control group. To measure the impact of transfer frequency, half of the recipients were paid twice per month and the other half received quarterly transfers. We surveyed 1,074 respondents 18 months after the beginning of transfers. Receiving guaranteed income had no impact on the labor supply of full-time workers, but part-time workers (at baseline) had lower labor market participation by 13 percentage points. Income (excluding the transfer) was reduced by $333 per month on average relative to control households, and expenditures were reduced by $302 per month. At the same time, average non-housing debt balances declined by $2,190 over 18 months relative to the control group, although the drop is not statistically significant. We find a significant improvement in housing security, but no overall effects on indices of psychological and financial well-being. The recipients of twice-monthly transfers were more likely to own a car, had lower credit card debt and greater food security than recipients of quarterly transfers, but otherwise transfer frequency had little impact. Compared to male recipients, female recipients reported a greater increase in financial security, and a smaller reduction in earned income and expenditures.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33209,33209,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
Hustling From Home? Work From Home Flexibility and Entrepreneurial Entry,"John M. Barrios, Yael Hochberg & Hanyi (Livia) Yi","We investigate the influence of the growing trend of work-from-home (WFH) on new business formation, with a particular focus on the period surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. At baseline, local new business entry is positively associated with the proportion of occupations amenable to telework in the region. Utilizing the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of stay-at-home mandates as an exogenous shock, we examine the effects of realized flexibility for WFH on entrepreneurial entry. While overall new business registrations increased following pandemic stay-at-home mandates, areas with an occupational mix that has higher potential for telework demonstrate less pronounced growth in new business formation, particularly in regions with lower economic demand factors. Survey evidence highlights how flexibility provided by traditional employment reduces entrepreneurial intent, especially for workers seeking non-pecuniary benefits such as autonomy or flexibility. Consistent with this substitution effect, we observe significant gender disparities, with a notable decline in women-led startups in areas with greater telework potential. Our results suggest a nuanced tension between the attractiveness of flexibility in traditional employment and the autonomy provided by entrepreneurial entry.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33237,33237,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
Gender Composition and Group Behavior: Evidence from US City Councils,"Emilia Brito Rebolledo, Jesse Bruhn, Thea How Choon & E. Anna Weber","How does gender composition influence individual and group behavior? To study this question empirically, we assembled a new, national sample of United States city council elections and digitized information from the minutes of over 40,000 city-council meetings. We find that replacing a male councilor with a female councilor results in a 25p.p. increase in the share of motions proposed by women. This is despite causing only a 20p.p. increase in the council female share. The discrepancy is driven, in part, by behavioral changes similar to those documented in laboratory-based studies of gender composition. When a lone woman is joined by a female colleague, she participates more actively by proposing more motions. The apparent changes in behavior do not translate into clear differences in spending. The null finding on spending is not driven by strategic voting; however, preference alignment on local policy issues between men and women appears to play an important role. Taken together, our results both highlight the importance of nominal representation for cultivating substantive participation by women in high-stakes decision making bodies; and also provide evidence in support of the external validity of a large body of laboratory-based work on the consequences of group gender composition.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33223,33223,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
Valuing Policy Characteristics and New Products using a Simple Linear Program,H. Spencer Banzhaf,"The Random Utility Model (RUM) is a workhorse model for valuing new products or changes in public goods.  But RUMs have been faulted along two lines.  First, for including idiosyncratic errors that imply unreasonably high values for new alternatives and unrealistic substitution patterns.  Second, for involving strong restrictions on functional forms for utility.  This paper shows how, instead, starting with a revealed preference framework, one can partially identify nonparametrically the answers to policy questions about discrete alternatives.  When the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP) is satisfied, the approach weakly identifies a pure characteristics model.  When GARP is violated, it recasts the RUM errors as departures from GARP (critical cost efficiency), to be minimized using a minimum-distance criterion.  This perspective provides an alternative avenue for nonparametric identification of discrete choice models.  The paper illustrates the approach by estimating bounds on the values of ecological improvements in the Southern Appalachian Mountains using survey data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33225,33225,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024

While most angel investments perform poorly, mean returns are twice the invested capital, due largely to extreme skewness: around one-third of investments are a total loss, but the top one-percent return more than fifty times invested capital. Performance persistence among angels is largely attributable to unobserved investor characteristics.

The Effects of Gender Integration on Men: Evidence from the U.S. Military,"Kyle Greenberg, Melanie Wasserman & E. Anna Weber","Do men negatively respond when women first enter an occupation? We answer this question by studying the end of one of the final explicit occupational barriers to women in the U.S.: in 2016, the U.S. military opened all positions to women, including historically male-only combat occupations. We exploit the staggered integration of women into combat units to estimate the causal effects of the introduction of female colleagues on men’s job performance, behavior, and perceptions of workplace quality, using monthly administrative personnel records and rich survey responses. We find that integrating women into previously all-male units does not negatively affect men’s performance or behavioral outcomes, including retention, promotions, demotions, separations for misconduct, criminal charges, and medical conditions. Most of our results are precise enough to rule out small, detrimental effects. However, there is a wedge between men's perceptions and performance. The integration of women causes a negative shift in male soldiers' perceptions of workplace quality, with the effects driven by units integrated with a woman in a position of authority. We discuss how these findings shed light on the roots of occupational segregation by gender.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33235,33235,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
How Curvy is the Phillips Curve?,"Philip Bunn, Lena Anayi, Nicholas Bloom, Paul Mizen, Gregory Thwaites & Ivan Yotzov","Macro data suggests a convex relationship between inflation and economic slack, but identifying causality is challenging. Using micro data from large panel surveys of UK and US firms we show that the response of prices to demand shocks is also convex at the firm level. We obtain similar results using three different empirical exercises examining: the impact of COVID demand shocks, the response to sales shocks, and hypothetical shocks from a survey question. This convexity is strongest in firms and industries with higher inflation, disappears in horizons beyond two years, and is also present in response to cost shocks. We rationalize these findings in a menu cost model with positive trend inflation and decreasing returns at the firm level, which replicates firm and aggregate Phillips curve convexity. The non-linearity emerges from trend inflation pushing firms closer to their price increase thresholds.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33234,33234,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
Investor Memory and Biased Beliefs: Evidence from the Field,"Zhengyang Jiang, Hongqi Liu, Cameron Peng & Hongjun Yan","We survey a large, representative sample of retail investors in China to elicit their memories of stock market investments and their return expectations. We merge this survey data with administrative transaction data to test a model in which investors selectively recall past experiences to form their beliefs. Our analysis uncovers new facts about investor memory and highlights similarity-based recall as a novel mechanism of belief formation in financial markets. A rising market prompts investors to recall their past experiences more positively, leading to more optimistic forecasts of future returns. Recalled experiences explain a sizable fraction of cross-investor variation in return expectations and dominate actual experiences in their explanatory power. In the transaction data, we confirm that recalled experiences affect investors' trading decisions through a belief channel.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33226,33226,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
You Can Take Them With You: Recruiting Coworkers to One's Own New Firm,"Marc-Andreas Muendler, James E. Rauch & Sergio Mikio Koyama","New firms do not yet have employees who can aid recruiting by referrals, but entrepreneurs can recruit workers they know to their startups—in effect making their own referrals. We consider new firms in Brazil’s formal sector founded between 2002 and 2014, for which at least one founding owner can be traced to previous formal employment. We find that 35.1 percent of new firms with at least five employees hire one or more coworkers from a founding owner’s last employer in their first year of operation, and that 9.2 percent of first-year hires at new firms were coworkers at a founding owner’s last employer. The former coworkers most likely to join a founding owner’s new firm are those who, at their last employer, worked in the same plant as a founding owner, had long overlap with a founding owner, were classified in the same industry or occupation as a founding owner, and were hired at roughly the same time as a founding owner. Controlling for observable human capital and new firm fixed effects, former coworkers earn eight percent higher initial wages at new firms and are six percentage points less likely to separate before a new firm’s second year of operation. We find that the coworker wage premium diminishes with tenure by 0.5 percentage points per year and the coworker separation premium diminishes with tenure by 2.0 percentage points per year.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33230,33230,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024
Assessing Assessors,Huaizhi Chen & Lauren Cohen,"Property tax revenues – the largest discretionary source of revenue for local governments - adjust at a pace that is inconsistent with property values in the US. We show that this form of revenue smoothing may be rooted in the political economy of municipalities. Measures of local budget stressors are positively related to upward assessments of a property’s value. Moreover, municipalities are significantly more likely to reassess in up markets as opposed to down – consistent with maximizing tax base and revenue collected. Using micro-level evidence from just-passing school referenda in Illinois, these shocks to municipal liabilities lead to significant increases in property assessments without any associated increases in market values or transactions. Passing a referendum over the prior 3 years increases the probability that a house is reassessed upward by 23%. This flexible form of revenue smoothing creates avenues for personal rent extraction. We find that local tax assessors: 1) have tax assessments on their own properties significantly lower than neighboring properties; and 2) these tax assessments grow significantly slower than neighbors – lowering their tax bills. We further document a significant connection between the underassessment of tax assessors’ own properties and the tax-maximizing assessment gaps documented in the districts they operate.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33238,33238,December 2024,NBER,12/09/2024

Similarly, radio spectra do not deteriorate with age—and therefore do not impact measured consumption of fixed capital. However, this paper argues that radio spectrum licenses which the federal government gives for “free” to the telecommunications industry should be tracked as a capital transfer in BEA’s NIPA table 3.1.

Forbearance lending as a crisis management tool: evidence from Japan,"Isabelle Roland, Yukiko Saito and Philip Schnattinger","By Isabelle Roland, Yukiko Saito and Philip Schnattinger

Credit market interventions have become a widespread policy tool deployed by governments around the world to support their corporate sectors following shocks like the global financial crisis and the pandemic. Among those policies, forbearance programmes allowed firms to temporarily stop making payments on certain debt obligations or obtain debt forgiveness. However, the impact of these policies is not fully understood. In particular, forbearance lending is generally believed to keep unviable firms alive and contribute to the zombification of the corporate sector. To inform this debate, we examine the effects of Japan’s small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Financing Facilitation Act, which encouraged banks to offer loan forbearance to troubled SMEs. We develop a framework to quantify the aggregate impact of the policy using a difference-in-differences approach combined with back‑of‑the‑envelope counterfactual exercises. Our evaluation indicates that, when coupled with business restructuring plans, forbearance lending can temporarily boost output without contributing to the widespread zombification of the corporate sector.

Political Power and Market Power,"Bo Cowgill, Andrea Prat & Tommaso Valletti","Brandeis (1914) hypothesized that firms with market power will also attempt to gain political power. To explore this hypothesis empirically, we combine data on mergers with data on lobbying expenditures and campaign contributions in the US from 1999 to 2017. We pursue two distinct empirical approaches: a panel event study and a differential exposure design. Both approaches indicate that mergers are followed by large and persistent increases in lobbying activity, both by individual firms and by industry trade associations. There is also weaker evidence for an association of mergers with campaign contributions (PACs). We also find that mergers impact the extensive margin of political activity, for example, by impacting companies’ choice to establish their first in-house lobbying teams and/or first corporate PAC.

Conflict in Dismissals,Pauline Carry & Benjamin Schoefer,"How do the employer and the worker interact during a dismissal? This paper tests whether they cooperate to minimize costs, or instead engage in conflict—i.e., deliberately amplify costs. We leverage a unique feature of the French labor market: an employer and a worker can jointly opt to replace a costly dismissal by a cheaper and more flexible “separation by mutual agreement” (SMA). Introduced in 2008, SMAs eliminate red tape costs, enable severance pay bargaining, and preclude litigation. However, we find that only 12% of dismissals are resolved through SMAs—far below the efficient level predicted by standard bargaining models. Surveying HR directors, we identify three drivers of conflict that hinder cost minimization: (i) hostility between the employer and the employee, (ii) employers using dismissals as a “discipline device” to maintain incentives, and (iii) asymmetric beliefs about subsequent labor court outcomes. Using counterfactual scenarios in the survey, we find that removing these three drivers of conflict would increase SMA adoption from 12% to 67% of dismissals. We confirm that less conflictual dismissals—due to either better employer-employee relationships or workers benefiting from early retirement—end more often as SMAs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33245,33245,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
Suez,"David S. Jacks, Christopher M. Meissner & Nikolaus Wolf","For all its importance, there still is no comprehensive quantitative assessment of the Suez Canal’s opening in 1869. We find that it led to a 72% relative increase in bilateral exports for affected country pairs and a likely permanent increase in world trade. With respect to the composition of trade, Suez was associated with large changes in export shares but only for a handful of goods categories. With respect to mechanisms, the relative cost of using steamships on Suez-affected routes fell dramatically and immediately after 1869, suggesting a vital role for the canal in the global diffusion of steam technology.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33250,33250,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
Financial Inclusion Across the United States,"Motohiro Yogo, Andrew Whitten & Natalie Cox","We study retirement and bank account participation for the universe of U.S. households with a member aged 50 to 59 in the administrative tax data. ZCTA-level average income, income inequality, and racial composition predict retirement account participation for low-income households, conditional on household income and regional price parities. Income inequality also predicts bank account participation for low-income households. We estimate the causal effect of access to an employer retirement plan on participation. Recent policy proposals for universal access with automatic enrollment could increase participation by 19 percentage points in the lowest income quintile over ten years.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33256,33256,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
When Given Discretion Teachers Did Not Shirk: Evidence from Remedial Education in Secondary Schools,"Sabrin A. Beg, Anne E. Fitzpatrick, Jason T. Kerwin, Adrienne Lucas & Khandker Wahedur Rahman","Public-sector organizations face a tradeoff: allowing workers discretion at the point of service to adapt to local needs, versus rigid harmonization to ensure uniform service delivery. We examine this tradeoff in the context of secondary schools in Odisha, India, where the centrally set curriculum is nearly 4 grades above the learning levels of the mean student. We conduct a randomized intervention that assigned schools to either a rigid or a flexible version of a remedial learning intervention that displaced the curriculum. We compare learning outcomes and teaching quality to the status quo. Both interventions increased learning by 0.11SD, about 60 percent of a year of learning, with gains throughout the learning distribution. We find no crowd-out of grade-level mastery, and no change in the likelihood of earning passing Board Marks one year later. Discretion did not lower the quality of implementation or induce shirking. Allowing teachers flexibility to adjust classroom content to student needs was beneficial and had limited downsides.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33242,33242,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
"Financing, Ownership, and Performance: A Novel, Longitudinal Firm-Level Database","J. David Brown, Steven J. Davis, Lucia S. Foster, John C. Haltiwanger & John Sabelhaus","The Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) underpins many studies of firm-level behavior. It tracks longitudinally all employers in the nonfarm private sector but lacks information about business financing and owner characteristics. We address this shortcoming by linking LBD observations to firm-level data drawn from several large Census Bureau surveys. The resulting Longitudinal Employer, Owner, and Financing (LEOF) database contains more than 3 million observations at the firm-year level with information about start-up financing, current financing, owner demographics, ownership structure, profitability, and owner aspirations – all linked to annual firm-level employment data since the firm hired its first employee.

The Effect of Medicaid on Crime: Evidence from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment,"Amy Finkelstein, Sarah Miller & Katherine Baicker","Those involved with the criminal justice system have disproportionately high rates of mental illness and substance use disorders, prompting speculation that health insurance, by improving treatment of these conditions, could reduce crime. Using the 2008 Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, which randomly made some low-income adults eligible to apply for Medicaid, we find no statistically significant impact of Medicaid coverage on criminal charges or convictions. These null effects persist for high-risk subgroups, such as those with prior criminal cases and convictions or mental health conditions. In the full sample, our confidence intervals can rule out most quasi-experimental estimates of Medicaid's crime-reducing impact.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33244,33244,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
Why do we need to strengthen climate adaptations? Scenarios and financial lines of defence,"Francesco Paolo Mongelli, Andrej Ceglar, Benedikt Alois Scheid","Adaptation needs are vast, rising fast and difficult to determine in their entirety, especially with uncertain adverse scenarios due to climate inertia and implementation lags. Adaptation is hindered by a lack of a unified understanding of what it necessitates; the challenge in pointing out its costs, benefits, and residual risks; insufficiently prescriptive policy and legal frameworks; and the growing financing gap. Conversely, we now have better granular climate data to study the impacts of climate hazards and forecast climate risks; there is awareness that adaptation choices must be dynamic and reactive; and there is an increasing pool of case studies from which to learn. There is evidence that efficient adaptation investments can yield “triple-dividends” helping to close the financing gap. There is a need to absorb and smooth the impacts of rising extreme climate events. Innovative financial instruments, such as catastrophe bonds and climate bonds, might support challenged insurance coverages.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3005~35f938a452.en.pdf?90d0bf2c1e6b8f32b65280c00f1f9c0b,3005,16 December 2024,ECB,12/16/2024
Beyond Bruen: Can Firearm Training Replace Local Discretion in Concealed Carry Permitting?,"John J. Donohue, Matthew Benavides, Amy L. Zhang & Alex Oktay","The 2022 Supreme Court case NYSRPA v. Bruen struck down states’ discretion in issuing individuals firearm right-to-carry permits. As the country transitions towards more and more permissive concealed carry regulation, it has remained unclear how permitting processes and requirements affect personal and public safety. Leveraging a novel dataset of state laws spanning 2000- 2022, we find that more stringent concealed carry requirements, such as higher fees or more training hours, do not deter gun owners from obtaining carrying licenses, nor do they alter their behavior substantially enough to impact public safety outcomes including violent crimes, gun theft, or accidental shootings. As such, stricter training requirements are unable to counteract the effects of more permissive concealed carry issuance.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33240,33240,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
The Long-run Effects of Transportation Productivity on the US Economy,"A. Kerem Coşar, Sophie Osotimehin & Latchezar Popov","We quantify the aggregate, regional and sectoral impacts of transportation productivity growth on the US economy over the period 1947-2017. Using a multi-region, multi-sector model that explicitly captures produced transportation services as a key input to interregional trade, we find that the calibrated change in transportation productivity had a sizable impact on aggregate welfare, magnified by a factor of 2.3 compared to its sectoral share in GDP. The amplification mechanism results from the complementarity between transport services and tradable goods, interacting with sectoral and spatial linkages. The geographical implications are highly uneven, with the West and Southwest benefiting the most from market access improvements while the Northeast experiences a decline. Sectoral impacts are largest in transportation-intensive activities like agriculture, mining and heavy manufacturing. Our results demonstrate the outsized and heterogeneous impact of the transportation sector in shaping US economic activity through specialization and spatial transformation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33248,33248,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
LASH risk and Interest Rates,"Laura Alfaro, Saleem A. Bahaj, Robert Czech, Jonathon Hazell & Ioana Neamtu","This paper studies a form of liquidity risk that we call ‘Liquidity After Solvency Hedging’ or “LASH” risk. Financial institutions take LASH risk when they hedge against solvency risk, using strategies that require liquidity when the solvency of the institution improves. We focus on LASH risk relating to interest rate movements. Our framework implies that institutions with longer-duration liabilities than assets—e.g. pension funds and insurers—take more LASH risk as interest rates fall. Using UK regulatory data from 2019-22 on the universe of sterling repo and swap transactions, we measure, in real time and at the institution level, LASH risk for the non-bank sector. We find that at the peak level of LASH risk, a 100bps increase in interest rates would have led to liquidity needs close to the cash holdings of the pension fund and insurance sector. Using a cross-sectional identification strategy, we find that low interest rates caused increases in LASH risk.  We then find that the pre-crisis LASH risk of non-banks predicts their bond sales during the 2022 UK bond market crisis, contributing to the yield spike in the market.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33241,33241,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024

Granular Treasury Demand with Arbitrageurs,"Kristy A.E. Jansen, Wenhao Li & Lukas Schmid","We construct a novel dataset of sector-level U.S. Treasury holdings, covering the majority of the market. Using this dataset, we estimate maturity-specific demand functions and elasticities of different investors and the Fed, and integrate them into a dynamic equilibrium model of the Treasury market with risk-averse arbitrageurs. Quantifying the model reveals that (1) strong arbitrage leads to an elastic Treasury market and a steeply downward-sloping term structure of market elasticity; (2) monetary tightening raises term premia due to arbitrageurs interacting with investors exhibiting high cross-elasticities; (3) QE has limited impact unless the Fed credibly commits to sustained balance sheet expansion.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33243,33243,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
War Mobilization and Economic Development: World War II and Structural Transformation in India,Aneesha Parvathaneni & Dean Yang,"Can temporary wartime mobilization change the long-run development trajectory of an economy? We study how mobilization for World War II in colonial India influenced its subsequent development. From 1939 to 1945, the British colonial government purchased massive amounts of war materiel within India. We study long-run impacts on structural transformation—the transition of employment from agriculture to modern sectors (industry and services)—in Indian districts. Causal identification takes a shift-share approach, exploiting variation across industries in war-related government orders, and variation across districts in their pre-war industrial structure. We find that World War II economic mobilization had positive and significant impacts on long-run development. More than six decades later, districts with higher procurement of war materiel saw greater structural transformation from agriculture towards industry and services, and higher consumption levels, urbanization rates, and in-migration. We find substantial spillovers on services sectors not directly subject to procurement. The majority of structural transformation effects are driven by procurement of heavy industrial goods.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33246,33246,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
Conditions Under Which College Students Can be Responsive to Text-based Nudging,"Lindsay C. Page, Katharine E. Meyer, Jeonghyun Lee & Hunter Gehlbach","College success requires students to engage with their institution academically and administratively. Missteps with administrative processes can threaten student persistence and success. Through two experimental studies, one exploratory (N=13,657) and one pre-registered and confirmatory (N=11,561), we assessed the effectiveness of an artificially intelligent, text-based chatbot that proactively reached out to students to support navigation of administrative processes and use of campus resources. Across two-year and four-year college contexts, outreach was most effective when focused on discrete administrative processes–such as filing financial aid forms and managing registration holds–which were acute and time-sensitive and for which outreach could be targeted to those for whom it was relevant. We situate these experiments in the context of similar efforts targeting college students to formulate testable hypotheses about their effective use for promoting college success. Specifically, we hypothesize that proactive outreach will be most effective when: (1) framed as from a trusted source with whom students would expect to communicate; (2) targeted using data to ensure that communication is relevant to students’ personal circumstances; and (3) focused on well-defined, required, and often acute tasks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33257,33257,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
Knowledge Suppression and Resilience under Censorship: Three-century Book Publications in China,"Ying Bai, Ruixue Jia & Jiaojiao Yang","This study examines the short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of state censorship on knowledge production, focusing on the largest book-banning campaign in Chinese history, initiated during the compilation of the 'Siku Quanshu' (Complete Library in Four Sections) between 1772 and 1783. Analyzing publication data from over 161,000 books spanning the 1660s to the 1940s, we find that categories subjected to stricter censorship experienced significant declines in publication during the seven decades following the bans (1770s–1830s). However, beginning in the 1840s, political upheavals and the erosion of state control triggered a resurgence of publications in previously restricted categories. This pattern of suppression and recovery extends to ideas, as evidenced by keyword analysis of book titles. Further analysis highlights the central role of chilling effects in driving these dynamics, with the exit and entry of publishers playing a crucial role in both the suppression and subsequent revival of knowledge production.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33258,33258,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
Unhooking the Past: Early-life Exposure to Hookworm Eradication and Later-life Longevity,Hamid Noghanibehambari & Jason Fletcher,"This study examines the long-term effects of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission’s (RSC) hookworm eradication campaign, initiated in the American South in the 1910s, on old-age longevity. Utilizing Social Security Administration death records linked to the 1940 full-count census, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to examine the effects of early-life exposure to the eradication campaign on later-life outcomes. We find that individuals exposed to the RSC campaign during in-utero and early-life experience an increase of 1.3 months in longevity. The effects are substantially larger among nonwhites, children of illiterate mothers, and those born in urban areas. Moreover, we provide evidence of dynamic complementarity in the effects of hookworm eradication on longevity, with larger effects observed in counties exposed to the Rosenwald school construction movement and in states with more stringent child labor laws. Using the 1940 census and World War II enlistment data, we provide suggestive evidence of improvements in educational attainment, income, and cognitive ability as possible pathways. Our findings contribute to the literature on the lasting effects of early-life public health interventions and underscore the importance of such programs in addressing present-day global health challenges.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33249,33249,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
"Federal Reserve Structure, Economic Ideas, and Banking Policy During the “Quiet Period” in Banking",Michael D. Bordo & Edward S. Prescott,"We evaluate the decentralized structure of the Federal Reserve System as a mechanism for generating and processing new ideas on banking policy in the 1950s and 1960s. We document that demand for research and analysis was driven by banking industry developments and legal changes that required the Federal Reserve and other banking regulatory agencies to develop guidelines for bank mergers. In response to these developments, the Board and the Reserve Banks hired industrial organization economists and young economists out of graduate school who brought in the leading theory of industrial organization at the time, which was the structure, conduct, and performance (SCP) paradigm. This flow of ideas into the Federal Reserve from academia paralleled the flow that was going on in monetary policy and macroeconomics at the time and contributed to the increased professionalization of research at the Federal Reserve. We document how several Reserve Banks, particularly Boston and Chicago, innovated by creating dissertation support programs, collecting specialized data, and creating the Bank Structure Conference, which became the clearinghouse for academic work on bank structure and later for bank risk and financial stability. We interpret these examples as illustrating an advantage that a decentralized central bank has in the production of knowledge.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33263,33263,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
Toward an Understanding of the Political Economy of Using Field Experiments in Policymaking,Guglielmo Briscese & John A. List,"Field experiments provide the clearest window into the true impact of many policies, allowing us to understand what works, what does not, and why. Yet, their widespread use has not been accompanied by a deep understanding of the political economy of their adoption in policy circles. This study begins with a large-scale natural field experiment that demonstrates the ineffectiveness of a widely implemented intervention. We leverage this result to understand how policymakers and a representative sample of the U.S. population update their beliefs of not only the policy itself, but the use of science and the trust they have in government. Policymakers, initially overly optimistic about the program’s effectiveness, adjust their views based on evidence but show reduced demand for experimentation, suggesting experiment aversion when results defy expectations. Among the U.S. public, support for policy experiments is high and remains robust despite receiving disappointing results, though trust in the implementing institutions declines, particularly in terms of perceptions of competence and integrity. Providing additional information on the value of learning from unexpected findings partially mitigates this trust loss. These insights, from both the demand and supply side, reveal the complexities of managing policymakers’ expectations and underscore the potential returns to educating the public on the value of open-mindedness in policy experimentation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33239,33239,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
Nowcasting Made Easier: a toolbox for economists,"J. Linzenich, B. Meunier","We provide a versatile nowcasting toolbox that supports three model classes (dynamic factor models, large Bayesian VAR, bridge equations) and offers methods to manage data selection and adjust for Covid-19 observations. The toolbox aims at simplifying two key tasks: creating new nowcasting models and improving the policy analysis. For model creation, the toolbox automatizes testing input variables, assessing model accuracy, and checking robustness to the Covid period. The toolbox is organized along a structured three-step approach: variable pre-selection, model selection, and Covid robustness. Non-specialists can easily follow these steps to develop high-performing models, while experts can leverage the automated tests and analyses. For regular policy use, the toolbox generates a large range of outputs to aid conjunctural analysis like news decomposition, confidence bands, alternative forecasts, and heatmaps. These multiple outputs aim at opening the ""black box"" often associated with nowcasts and at gauging the reliability of real-time predictions. We showcase the toolbox features to create a nowcasting model for global GDP growth. Overall, the toolbox aims at facilitating creation, evaluation, and deployment of nowcasting models.

Cracks in the Glass Ceiling and Gender Equality: Do Exports Shatter the Glass Ceiling?,"Bruno César Araújo, Lourenço S. Paz & James E. West","We use Brazilian administrative employer-employee matched data of worker demographics, industry of affiliation, occupation, and wages to examine whether females in managerial and executive positions (cracks in the glass ceiling) lead to more gender-equal workplace outcomes. In response to the large and unanticipated 1999 Brazilian Real exchange rate devaluation, the gender wage gap widened across all firms. The contrast between female and male-led firms was large and highly significant regarding managerial and supervisory employees. Both the gender wage gap and the proportion of female employees grew more in female-led firms than in male-led firms, consistent with the predictions of our monopsony model of firm behavior. We conclude that exports further crack the glass ceiling but do not necessarily improve the gender wage gap.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33260,33260,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
Efficient Imperfect Competition with an Application to International Trade,Guido Menzio,"I study the equilibrium and the welfare effects of international trade when product markets are imperfectly competitive due of search frictions—as in Burdett and Judd (1983)—rather than product differentiation—as in Dixit and Stiglitz (1977). Markups are positive, even though there are multiple firms producing identical goods. Markups depend negatively on the number of firms producing identical goods, which, in turn, determines the extent of competition in the market. Markups may be increasing, constant, decreasing or non-monotonic in firm's size, depending on the extent of competition and on the distribution of marginal costs. The entry of firms and the quantity of output produced by each firm are efficient, even though the market is imperfectly competitive. International trade increases the measure of firms in the market, intensifies competition, lowers markups, and unambiguously increases welfare. These ""natural"" effects of trade emerge generically in the Burdett-Judd model of imperfect competition. In the Dixit-Stiglitz model of imperfect competition, these effects are an artifact of particular specifications of preferences.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33253,33253,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
Beliefs of Others: an Experiment,Marina Agranov & Polina Detkova,"We study how people think others update their beliefs upon encountering new evidence. We find that when two individuals share the same prior, one believes that new evidence cannot systematically shift the other’s beliefs in either direction (Martingale property). When the two have different priors, people think that any information brings others’ expected posteriors closer to their own prior, but this adjustment is less responsive to information quality than theory predicts. We identify the primary cause of this insensitivity and discuss the implications of our findings for strategic games with asymmetric information, information design, and, more broadly, for understanding societal polarization.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33261,33261,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
The Complementarity Between Cities and State Capacity,Edward L. Glaeser,"Public capacity complements urban density because externalities abound in cities and urban scale makes it possible to share infrastructure that needs to be managed. Yet, urban governments face limitations that are not experienced by private sector entities. A city cannot just stop policing if it decides it is bad at policing. Typically, public compensation and personnel policies are highly regulated either by law or by union contracts. City governments do, however, have one great advantage over private entities: a greater ability to learn from their peers. City governments do similar things throughout the world, while companies frequently specialize. Private companies have strong incentives to hide the trade secrets that make them more productive, cities do not. As individual cities do not have an incentive to make it easier for other governments to learn from them, multinational entities like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank could enable that learning. Since climate-change-related crises are relatively rare events, city-to-city learning seems particularly important for adapting to climate change.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33247,33247,December 2024,NBER,12/16/2024
Trust in central banks,Michael Ehrmann,"Trust in the central bank is an essential ingredient for a successful conduct of monetary policy. However, for many central banks trust has recently declined, for instance in the wake of the post-pandemic inflation surge, due to large errors in central banks’ inflation forecasts, or given problems when exiting from forward guidance. The rapid, substantial and persistent erosion of trust makes it clear that trust needs to be earned continuously. This paper reviews why trust is important, what determines it and how central banks can enhance it. It also argues that it is important for central banks to improve the measurement and monitoring of trust. It ends by highlighting some future challenges for maintaining trust.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3006~502710f3fa.en.pdf?007d66c308e21b3fcc7eccb29a7de727,3006,17 December 2024,ECB,12/17/2024

The geography of capital allocation in the euro area,"Roland Beck, Martin Schmitz, Antonio Coppola, Angus Lewis, Matteo Maggiori, Jesse Schreger","We assess Euro Area financial integration correcting for the role of “onshore offshore financial centers” (OOFCs) within the Euro Area. The OOFCs of Luxembourg, Ireland, and the Netherlands serve dual roles as both hubs of investment fund intermediation and centers of securities issuance by foreign firms. We provide new estimates of Euro Area countries’ bilateral portfolio investments which look through both roles, attributing the wealth held via investment funds to the underlying holders and linking securities issuance to the ultimate parent firms. Our new estimates show that the Euro Area is less financially integrated than it appears, both within the currency union and vis-à-vis the rest of the world. While official data suggests a sharp decline in portfolio home bias for Euro Area countries relative to other developed economies following the introduction of the euro, we demonstrate that this pattern only remains true for bond portfolios, while it is artificially generated by OOFC activities for equity portfolios. Further, using new administrative evidence on the identity of non-Euro Area investors in OOFC funds, we document that the bulk of the positions constituting missing wealth in international financial accounts are now accounted for by United Kingdom counterparts.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3007~d17c4ec031.en.pdf?2c3f1e029ffd4488a23d8c50a584933b,3007,18 December 2024,ECB,12/19/2024

Monetary policy and sentiment-driven fluctuations,Jenny Chan,"Sentiments, or beliefs about aggregate demand, can be self-fulfilling in models departing slightly from the complete information benchmark in the New Keynesian framework. Through its effect on aggregate variables, the policy stance determines the degree of complementarity in firms’ production (pricing) decisions and consequently, the precision of endogenous signals that firms receive. As a result, aggregate fluctuations can be driven by both fundamental and non-fundamental shocks. The distribution of non-fundamental shocks is endogenous to policy, introducing a novel trade-off between stabilising output and inflation. Both strong inflation targeting and nominal flexibilities increase the variance of non-fundamental shocks, which are shown to be suboptimal. Moreover, the Taylor principle is no longer sufficient to rule out indeterminacy. Instead, an interest rate rule that places sufficiently low weight on inflation eliminates non-fundamental volatility and thereby the output-inflation trade-off.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/monetary-policy-and-sentiment-driven-fluctuations,1106,"Fri, 20 Dec 2",BOE,12/22/2024
Life-Cycle Portfolio Choices and Heterogeneous Stock Market Expectations,Mateo Velásquez-Giraldo,Survey measurements of households' expectations about U.S. equity returns show substantial heterogeneity and large departures from the historical distribution of actual returns. The average household perceives a lower probability of positive returns and a greater probability of extreme returns than history has exhibited. I build a life-cycle model of saving and portfolio choices that incorporates beliefs estimated to match these survey measurements of expectations. This modification enables the model to greatly reduce a tension in the literature in which models that have aimed to match risky portfolio investment choices by age have required much higher estimates of the coefficient of relative risk aversion than models that have aimed to match age profiles of wealth. The tension is reduced because beliefs that are more pessimistic than the historical experience reduce people's willingness to invest in stocks.,https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/life-cycle-portfolio-choices-and-heterogeneous-stock-market-expectations.htm,2024-097,December 2024,FED-BOARD,12/22/2024
A Market Interpretation of Treatment Effects,Robert Minton and Casey B. Mulligan,"Markets, likened to an invisible hand, often appear to contradict econometric assumptions that rule out spillovers of one person’s treatment on another’s outcomes. This paper provides a simple statistical framework highlighting that controls are indirectly affected by the treatment through the market. Further, the effect of the treatment on the treated reveals only part of the consequence for the treated of treating the entire market. When combined with economic theory, our framework leads to a new application of Marshall’s Laws of Derived Demand that relates econometric estimates of treatment effects in the marketplace to the substitution and scale effects of demand theory. We show how treatment-effect estimators can diverge – both in magnitude and direction – from the causal effects of treatment on the treated or counterfactual policies treating all market participants. The framework shows how the consequences of targeted treatments reveal the effects of marketwide treatments, and the role of market frictions in that inference.

Measured Inflation and the New-Keynesian Model,"Lawrence J. Christiano, Martin Eichenbaum, and Benjamin K. Johannsen","Researchers typically compare inflation in the new Keynesian (NK) model to published inflation measures constructed from indices like the CPI. Inflation in the standard NK model without price indexation is bounded above. The model analogue of fixed-weight inflation measures, like the CPI, is not. When inflation is in the range of values observed after 2021, there is a substantial difference between model-based and fixed-weight measures of inflation. This finding poses a challenge to using linear approximations to the NK model in environments with moderately high inflation and implies that analysts should construct data-consistent model analogues when assessing the NK model.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/measured-inflation-and-the-new-keynesian-model.htm,2024-095,December 2024,FED-BOARD,12/22/2024

When refinancing meets monetary tightening: heterogeneous impacts on spending and debt via mortgage modifications,"Philippe Bracke, Matthew Everitt, Martina Fazio and Alexandra Varadi","This study examines how UK mortgagors adjusted their spending and saving habits in response to the post-2021 monetary tightening, highlighting the interplay between collateral-driven borrowing and the cash-flow channel of monetary policy. Unlike in markets with long-term fixed-rate mortgages, UK mortgagors face heightened exposure to interest rate shifts due to periodic refinancing requirements. By combining transaction-level data from a financial app with loan-level records, we create a detailed and representative view of UK mortgagors' monthly balance sheets from 2021 to 2023. This allows us to explore how mortgage modifications – particularly equity extraction and term extensions – shapes household responses to rising borrowing costs. Our findings reveal stark heterogeneity: households leveraging equity extraction, enabled by nominal house price appreciation, offset higher mortgage payments and maintain or increase discretionary spending while reducing unsecured debts. Conversely, households unable or unwilling to adjust loans face significant spending cuts in response to higher rates. These results suggest that collateral-driven debt, amplified by rising property values and mortgage term extensions, can partially compensate for the cash-flow channel in driving consumption and financial behaviour during tightening cycles. This highlights the dual role of loan modifications: while mitigating immediate consumption declines, they may affect monetary policy transmission for some groups and contribute to more persistent borrowing.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/when-refinancing-meets-monetary-tightening,1105,"Fri, 20 Dec 2",BOE,12/22/2024
"Minority Inflation, Unemployment, and Monetary Policy","Munseob Lee,  Claudia Macaluso and  Felipe F. Schwartzman","Our paper addresses the heterogeneous effects of monetary policy on households of different races. The cyclical volatility of real income differs significantly for households of different races and income levels, reflecting differential exposure to fluctuations in employment and consumer prices. All Black households are disproportionately affected by employment fluctuations, whereas price volatility is only particularly pronounced for Black households with income above the national median. The latter face 40 percent higher price volatility than both poorer households of the same race and white households of similar income. To evaluate the effects of policy, we propose a New Keynesian framework with heterogeneous exposure to employment and price volatility. We find that an accommodative monetary stance generates asymmetric outcomes within race groups. Low-income households experience unemployment stabilization benefits, while high-income ones incur real income volatility costs. Differences are especially large among Black households. Reducing the volatility of unemployment by 1 percentage point engenders a 1.17 percentage point reduction in overall income volatility for poorer Black households, but an increase of 0.6 percentage points in income volatility for richer Black households.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2024/wp_24-16,24-16,December 2024,FED-RICHMOND,12/22/2024

We document this relationship and use it to evaluate the behavior of inflation during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

New tools to monitor inflation in real time,Simon C. Smith and Alexander L. Wolman,"From 1995 through February 2020 – a period when inflation was relatively low and stable – the rate of monthly total Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation was tightly related to a measure of asymmetry in the distribution of price changes of its subcomponents. We document that relationship and use it to construct an ""inflation Filter"" to distinguish inflation that is broad-based from that which is idiosyncratic (explained by price changes in a small share of subcomponents). Our ""Inflation Filter"" can be viewed as a standard diffusion index in which the threshold each month is set equal to that month's inflation rate, allowing it to vary through time. In contrast to standard diffusion indexes that use an ad hoc time-invariant threshold, our approach generates considerable explanatory power for the rate of inflation in the pre-COVID period. This makes it useful for evaluating in real time whether inflation is returning to pre-pandemic norms.",https://www.federalreserve.gov//econres/notes/feds-notes/new-tools-to-monitor-inflation-in-real-time-20241220.html,1017016238071723617,"December 20, 2024",FED-BOARD-NOTES,12/22/2024
The Bronx is Burning: Urban Disinvestment Effects of the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements,"Ingrid Gould Ellen, Daniel Hartley, Jeffrey Lin, Wei You","In response to private insurers’ postwar withdrawal from urban neighborhoods, roughly half of U.S. states developed programs in the late 1960s that offered residual property insurance to property owners denied in the private market. These plans, known as Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plans after 1968, inadvertently encouraged moral hazard through underwriting restrictions, risk pooling, and generous payouts. We use a triple-difference design to estimate FAIR’s impact, comparing: (1) pre- and post-FAIR participation periods, (2) neighborhoods likely offered FAIR plans versus those not, and (3) similar contrasts in non-participating states.

We provide evidence that dealers turn to sponsored repo on occasions when balance sheet space is scarce, such as when there is a large issuance of Treasury coupon securities and end-of-month dates.

The effect of mortgage brokers on banks' business models,Marcus Buckmann and Peter Eccles,"We study the effects intermediaries have on the UK mortgage market by exploiting the strong increase in broker intermediation between 2013 and 2020. Our findings indicate that this rise coincided with more households choosing mortgages with a short fixed term, due to brokers steering households towards these mortgages to increase fees from repeat business. Increased broker intermediation also enabled smaller lenders to reach more customers by geographically diversifying their mortgage portfolios, which gave smaller lenders the opportunity to specialise their mortgage portfolios, concentrating on long fixed-term and high LTV mortgages.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/the-effect-of-mortgage-brokers-on-banks-business-models,1104,"Fri, 20 Dec 2",BOE,12/22/2024

Investor flows do not respond to this information when managers perceive higher risk than what their past returns would indicate, suggesting managers strategically communicate their risk assessments with investors.

Ideological Bias in Estimates of the Impact of Immigration,George J. Borjas & Nate Breznau,"When studying policy-relevant topics, researchers’ policy preferences may shape the design, execution, analysis, and interpretation of results. Detection of such bias is challenging because the research process itself is not normally part of a controlled experimental setting. Our analysis exploits a rare opportunity where 158 researchers working independently in 71 research teams participated in an experiment. After being surveyed about their position on immigration policy, they used the same data to answer the same well-defined empirical question: Does immigration affect the level of public support for social welfare programs? The researchers estimated 1,253 alternative regression models, producing a frequency distribution of the measured impact ranging from strongly negative to strongly positive. We find that research teams composed of pro-immigration researchers estimated more positive impacts of immigration on public support for social programs, while anti-immigration research teams reported more negative estimates. Moreover, the methods used by teams with strong pro- or anti- immigration priors received lower “referee scores” from their peers in the experiment. These lower-rated models helped produce the different effects estimated by the teams at the tails of the immigration sentiment distribution. The underlying research design decisions are the mechanism through which ideology enters the production function for parameter estimates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33274,33274,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Spatial Linkages and the Uneven Effects of a Commodity Boom,"Felipe Benguria, Felipe Saffie & Shihangyin Zhang","We study the uneven effects of a commodity boom, documenting its impact across workers based on their skill and on the region where they live. To this end, we develop a dynamic quantitative model of an economy with many regions connected through interregional trade and migration. Empirically, we focus on the experience of Brazil during the commodity boom of the 2000s and calibrate the model using detailed micro-level data. At the aggregate level, the boom leads to a decline in the skill premium, resulting from a larger increase in the real wages of unskilled than skilled workers. The model indicates that the commodity boom accounts for a quarter of the decline in the skill premium observed during this period, and masks substantial heterogeneity across states and sectors. Finally, using the model to simulate counterfactuals, we show that spatial linkages—interregional migration and interregional trade—play an important role in shaping the impact of the boom. Spatial linkages reduce the decline in the skill premium at the national level, and also reduce the extent of spatial inequality due to the boom.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33287,33287,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Lessons Learned and Ignored in U.S. Place-Based Policymaking,Matthew Freedman & David Neumark,"Place-based programs aim to encourage economic and community development in defined geographic areas. They frequently offer tax incentives, grants, loans, or regulatory relief to private or non-profit entities for investing in specific communities. Funding can support a range of activities, including investments in job creation, infrastructure, workforce development, affordable housing, and more. Interest in spatially targeted interventions in the U.S. has waxed and waned over time in response to changing political environments, policy advocacy, and the evolving conclusions of academic research. The nature of place-based programs themselves has also evolved – often building on the lessons learned from past research and experience, but sometimes ignoring these lessons. In this chapter, we review what we have learned from past place-based job creation programs in the U.S. context.

Geopolitics and the World Trading System,"Aaditya Mattoo, Michele Ruta & Robert W. Staiger","Until the beginning of this century, the GATT/WTO system worked. Economic research provided a compelling explanation. It showed that if governments maximize the well-being of their own countries broadly defined, GATT/WTO principles would facilitate mutually beneficial cooperation over their trade policy choices. Now heightened geopolitical rivalry seems to have undermined the WTO. A simple transposition of the previous rationalization suggests that geopolitics and trade cooperation are not compatible. We show that this is only true if rivalry eclipses any consideration of own-country well-being. In all other circumstances, there are gains from trade cooperation even with geopolitics. Furthermore, the WTO’s relevance is in question only if it adheres too rigidly to its existing rules and norms. Through measured adaptation to the geopolitical imperative, the WTO can continue to thrive as a forum for multilateral trade cooperation in the age of geopolitics.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33293,33293,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
The Benefits and Costs of Paid Family Leave,"Buyi Wang, Meredith Slopen, Irwin Garfinkel, Elizabeth Ananat, Sophie M.

To inform policy discussions, we provide a benefit-cost analysis of introducing such a program. We systematically identify high-quality, quasi-experimental studies on the impact of paid leave on infants and parents. Using the most conservative estimates or the mean estimates from this literature, we estimate that every $1,000 investment in paid parental leave would generate, respectively, $7,275 or $29,406 in present discounted net social benefits. We use these estimates to conduct a microsimulation of benefits and costs of two policy proposals with different eligibility and wage replacement rates. The first, a 4-week program, would have an initial fiscal cost of under $2 billion and net social benefits of $13 (conservative) or $55 billion (mean). The corresponding figures for the 12-week program are about 3.7 times larger, suggesting that either version would likely generate high returns.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33279,33279,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024

The Dynamic Fiscal Costs of Outsourcing Health Insurance - Evidence from Medicaid,Timothy Layton & Eran Politzer,"Setting payment rates for providers contracted over multiple periods is a persistent challenge in government procurement. We study the dynamics of fiscal costs following the outsourcing of Medicaid provision to private health insurers by states. We focus on beneficiaries with disabilities who account for a third of Medicaid's spending. Using a national administrative database, we identify county-level private plan enrollment mandates and exploit them as an instrument for individuals' transition to managed care plans. These transitions, while initially slightly reducing fiscal costs, lead to a continuous increase in Medicaid's costs over subsequent years. Counties subject to mandates experience a 9.8% higher cost four years post-mandate compared to those without mandates. ""Actuarially sound"" endogenous payment rates, that are based on past costs in the market, may serve as mechanism underlying the rising spending.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33302,33302,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024

What lies at the core of inequality among nations? Unified Growth Theory explores the evolution of societies over the entire course of human history. It uncovers the universal wheels of change that have governed the journey of humanity, driven the growth process, and shaped inequality across the globe. The theory sheds light on two of the most fundamental mysteries surrounding this journey: (i) The Mystery of Growth—the origins of the dramatic transformation in human prosperity over the past two centuries, in the wake of millennia of near stagnation; and (ii) The Mystery of Inequality—the roots of the vast inequality in the wealth of nations.

Risk Loving and Fat Tails in the Wealth Distribution,"Aloisio Araujo, Juan Pablo Gama & Timothy J. Kehoe","We study the dynamic properties of the wealth distribution in an overlapping generations model with warm-glow bequests and heterogeneous attitudes towards risk. Some dynasties of agents are risk averters, and others are risk lovers. Agents can invest in two types of Lucas trees. The two types of trees are symmetric in the sense that one type has a high return in states where the other has a return of zero. This symmetry allows risk averters to perfectly ensure their future income and eliminates aggregate uncertainty in the model. Furthermore, risk lovers take extreme portfolio positions, which make it easy for us to characterize the evolution of their wealth holdings over time. We show that the model has an equilibrium in which the aggregate wealth distribution converges to a unique invariant distribution. The invariant distribution of wealth of the risk lovers has fat tails for high bequest rates. The existence of fat tails is endogenously generated by the behavior of risk lovers rather than by the exogenous existence of fat tails in the endowments or in the returns of the assets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33298,33298,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024

Diffusion in Social Networks: Experimental Evidence on Information Sharing vs Persuasion,"Marcel Fafchamps, Asadul Islam, Debayan Pakrashi & Denni Tommasi","We conduct a clustered randomized controlled trial across 180 villages in Uttar Pradesh, India, to promote the take-up of a savings commitment product newly introduced to our study population. A random subset of participants was targeted through our promotional campaign to test whether the product's diffusion among untargeted participants operates primarily through information sharing or through persuasion by incentivized target participants. If social learning is the main channel of diffusion, we would expect higher sign-up and take-up rates in information villages compared to persuasion villages. Conversely, if persuasion is the primary channel, sign-up and take-up rates should be higher in persuasion villages. Our findings consistently favor the persuasion channel, as sign-up and take-up rates were higher in the persuasion treatment, even without increased financial literacy or knowledge about the product. Information alone had a negligible impact on take-up, while the combined treatment achieved the highest sign-up and conversion rates, suggesting that information complements persuasion by enhancing its effectiveness. These results highlight the importance of incentivized persuasion in promoting product take-up and suggest that, in certain contexts, direct information-sharing may be less effective than previously assumed.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33285,33285,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024

Instrumental Variables with Time-Varying Exposure: New Estimates of Revascularization Effects on Quality of Life,"Joshua Angrist, Bruno Ferman, Carol Gao, Peter Hull, Otavio L. Tecchio & Robert W. Yeh","The ISCHEMIA Trial randomly assigned patients with ischemic heart disease to an invasive treatment strategy centered on revascularization with a control group assigned non-invasive medical therapy. As is common in such “strategy trials,” many participants assigned to treatment remained untreated while many assigned to control crossed over into treatment. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses of strategy trials preserve randomization-based comparisons, but ITT effects are diluted by non-compliance. Conventional per-protocol analyses that condition on treatment received are likely biased by discarding random assignment. In trials where compliance choices are made shortly after assignment, instrumental variables (IV) methods solve both problems—recovering an undiluted average causal effect of treatment for treated subjects who comply with trial protocol. In ISCHEMIA, however, some controls were revascularized as long as five years after random assignment. This paper extends the IV framework for strategy trials, allowing for such dynamic non-random compliance behavior. IV estimates of long-run revascularization effects on quality of life are markedly larger than previously reported ITT and per-protocol estimates. We also show how to estimate complier characteristics in a dynamic-treatment setting. These estimates reveal increasing selection bias in naive time-varying per-protocol estimates of revascularization effects. Compliers have baseline health similar to that of the study population, while control-group crossovers are far sicker.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33296,33296,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Equilibrium Conditions for Catch-22 Situations,Joshua S. Gans,"This is a paper in the ``economists ruin everything'' field. It considers whether Catch-22 situations can persist as an equilibrium phenomenon. Rather than being an arbitrary rule or a set of self-serving beliefs, the focus is on the preferences of Gatekeepers who choose to create such situations in the first place. The base game-theoretic model is of a Catch-22 situation inspired by Heller's famous paradox. We consider a Requester who may be Sane or Insane and a Gatekeeper who must decide whether to grant the Requester's desired outcome or force them into a less desirable one. This is modelled as a game in which the Requester chooses whether to send a request signal before the Gatekeeper decides. We solve for the conditions under which a Catch-22 situation persists as an equilibrium and its efficiency properties. It is demonstrated that Catch-22 situations can arise, but they reflect an efficient response on the part of a Gatekeeper facing asymmetric information.

"Non-Profit Hospital Governance, Conduct, and CEO Pay",Daniel Kessler & William Wygal,"We investigate whether two characteristics of non-profit hospital boards – the number of board members and whether the CEO is a board member – are associated with CEO pay and several measures of hospital performance, including price, operating margin, quality, and service to low-income patients.  Although the consequences of CEO board membership for for-profit firms have been studied extensively, the consequences for non-profits in general, and non-profit hospitals in particular, have received little attention.  Because most hospitals are non-profit and non-profit hospital prices have increased rapidly over the past 20 years, this gap is important.   We find a strong positive association between CEO board membership and non-profit hospital prices, operating margins, and CEO pay, with a weaker positive (negative) association between CEO board membership and quality (service to low-income patients).   We conclude that CEO board membership contributes to the fundamental agency problem between non-profit hospitals’ management and the hospitals’ intended beneficiaries, consistent with the concerns expressed by Fama and Jensen (1983).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33278,33278,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Deterrence Through Response Curves: An Empirical Analysis of the Gaza-Israel Conflict,"Eli Berman, Prabin B. Khadka, Danny Klinenberg & Esteban Klor","We use response curves in a repeated game to analyze key aspects of mutual deterrence: escalation, de-escalation, incomplete deterrence, and deterrence by denial. In this approach, episodes of violence are due to interacting response curves, which disincentivize opponents from attacking through both deterrence and compellence. Both sides punish attacks to maintain credibility in future episodes, disincentivizing larger attacks and yielding nonviolent lulls. We empirically estimate those curves using detailed incident data from the Israel-Gaza conflict between 2007 and 2017. Our estimates match the dynamics of the raw data: very frequent episodes of low lethality violent exchange. Response curves are stable and probably Markovian. They exhibit a posture consistent with incomplete deterrence: i.e., episodes de-escalate, but to a violent equilibrium. Israeli missile defense shifts the Gazan response curve to a less aggressive posture, as predicted by theory.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33273,33273,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
College Major Restrictions and Student Stratification,Zachary Bleemer & Aashish Mehta,"Underrepresented minority (URM) college students have been steadily earning degrees in relatively less lucrative fields of study since the mid-1990s. A decomposition reveals that this widening gap is principally explained by rising stratification at public research universities, many of which increasingly prevent students with poor introductory grades from declaring popular majors. We investigate these major restriction policies by constructing a novel 50-year dataset covering four public research universities' student transcripts and employing a staggered difference-in-difference design around the implementation of 25 GPA-based restrictions. Restrictions disproportionately filter out less-prepared students with fewer pre-college academic opportunities, decreasing average URM enrollment shares by 20 percent. They do not measurably improve allocative efficiency across majors, departments' wage value-added, or filtered students' educational attainment.

While unit-specific intercepts control for unobserved time-invariant confounders, dependence between (i) regressors (e.g., marketing mix strategy of interests) and the current error term (regressor endogeneity) and/or between (ii) regressors and heterogeneous slope coefficients (slope endogeneity) can introduce significant estimation bias, resulting in misleading inference. This paper proposes a two-stage copula endogeneity correction mean group (2sCOPE-MG) estimator for panel data models, simultaneously addressing both endogeneity concerns. We generalize the IV-free copula control function, employing a general location Gaussian copula that effectively captures the panel structure. The heterogeneous coefficients are treated as unit-specific fixed parameters without distributional assumptions. Consequently, the 2sCOPE-MG estimator allows for arbitrary dependence structure between heterogeneous coefficients and regressors. Unlike Haschka (2022), 2sCOPE-MG requires neither a normal error distribution nor a Gaussian copula regressor-error dependence structure and is more robust, easier to implement, and capable of addressing slope endogeneity. The 2sCOPE-MG estimator is extended to dynamic panels, where intertemporal dependence in the outcome process can be suitably captured. We study its asymptotic properties and provide an analytical variance formula for inference without the need to bootstrap. For short dynamic panels, a Jackknife bias-corrected 2sCOPE-MG estimator is provided to ensure unbiased inference. The usage of the 2sCOPE-MG estimator is demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations and a marketing mix response application across 21 categories to account for regressor and slope endogeneities in store-panel sales data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33265,33265,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Can Gifted Education Help Higher-Ability Boys from Disadvantaged Backgrounds?,"David Card, Eric Chyn & Laura Giuliano","Boys are less likely than girls to enter college, a gap that is often attributed to a lack of non-cognitive skills such as motivation and self-discipline. We study how being classified as gifted – determined by having an IQ score of 116 or higher – affects college entry rates of disadvantaged children in a large urban school district. For boys with IQ’s around the cutoff, gifted identification raises the college entry rate by 25-30 percentage points – enough to catch up with girls in the same IQ range. In contrast, we find small effects for girls. Looking at course-taking and grade outcomes in middle and high school, we find large effects of gifted status for boys that close most of the gaps with girls, but no detectable effects on standardized tests scores of either gender. Overall, we interpret the evidence as demonstrating that gifted services raise the non-cognitive skills of boys conditional on their cognitive skills, leading to gains in educational attainment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33282,33282,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Consumer Preferences for Cigarettes and Heated Tobacco Products in Japan: Evidence from a Discrete Choice Experiment,"Donald S. Kenkel, Alan D. Mathios, Grace N. Phillips, Revathy Suryanarayana, Hua Wang & Sen Zeng","Heated tobacco products (HTPs), a harm reducing cigarette alternative, gained popularity over the past decade and appear to have contributed significantly to the reduction of smoking in Japan. While the increased popularity of HTPs suggests a consumer preference for cigarette alternatives, there is a limited understanding of how consumers choose between different tobacco products. Understanding consumer choice is especially salient given the evolving policy landscape and proposals to increase HTP taxes. This study uses a large discrete choice experiment to examine the decision-making processes of smokers in Japan when choosing between cigarettes, HTPs, and quitting. We assess the influence of various product attributes such as prices, flavors, nicotine content, and warning messages on these choices. The findings reveal that prices and flavors significantly influence smokers' preferences. Specifically, higher HTP prices tend to drive smokers back to combustible cigarettes and discourage them from choosing to quit. Additionally, there is some evidence that consumers prefer HTPs with a wide variety of flavors. Meanwhile, hypothetical policy simulations that change warning messages or nicotine content do not affect consumers' choices.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33301,33301,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
"Collective Bargaining, Unions, and the Wage Structure: An International Perspective","Simon Jäger, Suresh Naidu & Benjamin Schoefer","In this paper, we assess the recent economics literature on collective bargaining. Despite a declining trend in the OECD in coverage and especially union membership, a large share of formal workers around the world are still covered by collective bargaining agreements. We describe the substantial institutional variation across a variety of countries, highlighting research done with modern research designs and recently available administrative datasets. We then estimate a canonical empirical model of individual-level coverage effects and selection in harmonized cross-country data across 18 advanced economies (in Europe and North America). We estimate collective bargaining coverage premia, compression, selection, and spillover coefficients in each country, and use these to document considerable heterogeneity in collective bargaining coverage effects on the wage structure. While there is a strong negative relationship between collective bargaining coverage and wage inequality across countries, substantial uncertainties remain about the underlying mechanisms. Coverage effects may operate through direct premia, selection, or spillovers onto non-covered wages, but distinguishing and quantifying these channels and how they vary across institutional contexts remains a key challenge for future research. In our data, we find that the direct effect of coverage on wages of covered workers does not explain much of the cross-country correlation between coverage and inequality. While compelling research designs often result from specific institutional variation, we also emphasize that these contextual details must be accounted for when comparing estimates across industrial relations systems. A particularly pressing need is for more compelling causal evidence on spillover effects, which could help reconcile conflicting micro and macro evidence on how collective bargaining shapes the wage distribution.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33267,33267,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Transition Risk: Sources and Policy Responses,"Stefano Carattini, Garth Heutel, Givi Melkadze & Inès Mourelon","Transition risk – the financial stability risk related with decarbonization – is a major source of concern. The literature has so far only studied transition risk caused by carbon tax shocks. This paper explores other potential sources of transition risk: two other policy sources – subsidies to abatement or to green producers – and two preference-based sources – a shock to consumer preferences and a shock to investor preferences. We develop an environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that includes a frictional financial sector, and we consider macroprudential policy responses to transition risks. These different shocks have different effects on the possibility of transition risk and lead to different macroprudential policy implications.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33275,33275,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Adaptation to Climate Change,"Tamma Carleton, Esther Duflo, Kelsey Jack & Guglielmo Zappalà","Mounting costs of anthropogenic climate change reveal that adaptation will be essential to human well-being in coming decades. At the same time, the literature on the economics of adaptation offers relatively little guidance for emerging policy. In this chapter, we review the existing literature, focusing on how it can better inform adaptation policy design and implementation. A simple conceptual model of adaptation decision-making describes two core adaptation channels that we link to two streams of adaptation literature, which have emerged largely in parallel. We outline how insights from these literatures can be used for adaptation policy evaluation, highlight key limitations of and opportunities for public intervention in private adaptation markets, and provide guidance for future work.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33264,33264,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Climbing the Ivory Tower: How Socio-Economic Background Shapes Academia,"Ran Abramitzky, Lena Greska, Santiago Pérez, Joseph Price, Carlo Schwarz & Fabian Waldinger","We explore how socio-economic background shapes academia, collecting the largest dataset of U.S. academics’ backgrounds and research output. Individuals from poorer backgrounds have been severely underrepresented for seven decades, especially in humanities and elite universities. Father’s occupation predicts professors’ discipline choice and, thus, the direction of research. While we find no differences in the average number of publications, academics from poorer backgrounds are both more likely to not publish and to have outstanding publication records. Academics from poorer backgrounds introduce more novel scientific concepts, but are less likely to receive recognition, as measured by citations, Nobel Prize nominations, and awards.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33289,33289,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
From Flat to Fair? The Effects of a Progressive Tax Reform,"Nicolas Ajzenman, Guillermo Cruces, Ricardo Perez-Truglia, Darío Tortarolo & Gonzalo Vazquez-Bare","This paper investigates the impact of a progressive tax reform on tax compliance. We leverage a major progressive tax reform in a large Argentine municipality. First, we use a quasi-experimental design to estimate the causal effect of changes in a household's own tax rates on its tax compliance. Second, we utilize a large-scale natural field experiment to examine whether, holding a household's own tax rates constant, tax compliance is influenced by the tax rates of poorer or richer households. We find that reducing taxes for poorer households increases their compliance, while increasing taxes for richer households decreases their compliance. When poor households learn about the tax hike on the rich, this increases their perceived fairness of the tax system and their tax compliance. When rich households learn about the tax cuts for the poor, their perceived fairness increases significantly, but their compliance, if anything, goes down. Leveraging another reform (and another field experiment) that took place a year later, we show that both the quasi-experimental and experimental findings replicate. Our evidence highlights that tax compliance depends not only on a household's own tax rate but also on its perception of the broader tax schedule. Our findings also highlight the gap between stated and revealed preferences for redistribution. Lastly, we conduct a counterfactual analysis to illustrate the implications of our findings for the design of tax policies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33286,33286,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Open Banking and Digital Payments: Implications for Credit Access,"Shashwat Alok, Pulak Ghosh, Nirupama Kulkarni & Manju Puri","Does the ability to generate verifiable digital financial histories, with customers having data-sharing rights, improve credit access? We answer this using India’s launch of an Open-Banking based public digital payment infrastructure (UPI). Using rarely available data on the universe of consumer loans we show credit increases by both fintechs (new entrants) and banks (incumbents), on the intensive and extensive margin, including increased credit to subprime and new-to-credit customers. We show several mechanisms at play: low-cost internet improves credit access, lenders weigh in digital histories, and digital payments with Open Banking effectively complement first-time bank accounts enabling access to formal credit.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33259,33259,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Access to Digital Credit for Smallholder Farmers: Experimental Evidence from Ghana,"Dean Karlan, Monica P. Lambon-Quayefio, Utsav Manjeer & Christopher R. Udry","Digital finance in agriculture is a nascent technology which could help improve rural financial inclusion. In an experimental evaluation of a digital lending product for farmers in Southern Ghana, credit increases farm investments but has few statistically significant average effects on downstream outcomes. However, logistical challenges generated imperfect compliance with the treatment assignment, with some loans delivered in a timely fashion for agricultural investments and others coming later. We cautiously exploit this unplanned non-experimental implementation heterogeneity and conclude that agriculturally-focused digital credit platforms have potential to tackle persistent rural financial market imperfections, but the timing seems critical and deserves further study.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33271,33271,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
On the Definition and Estimation of Economic Resilience using Counterfactuals,Mo Alloush & Michael Carter,"This paper defines the first measure of economic resilience based on the cumulative current and future losses a shock-exposed household experiences relative to a counterfactual measure of what household economic well-being would have been absent the shock. Drawing on the rich economics literature on the sensitivity of household income and consumption to shocks, we derive a resilience metric that can be estimated with panel data using standard impact evaluation methods. To illustrate these methods, we first use simulated data from a dynamic optimization model and a known data generation process. We show how this metric can be used to not only evaluate the impact of different policies on resilience but also to judge the public finance efficacy by showing how the cumulative avoided loss based resilience measure can be used for cost-benefit analysis. We then we illustrate how to use these methods to calculate resilience at the household level and show that reliance on income as a measure of economic well-being may be wiser in the absence of long-term data. Finally, We then use data from a recent experiment in Eastern and Southern Africa to show that these methods can be informative even with relatively short duration data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33290,33290,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Firm Financing During Sudden Stops: Can Governments Substitute Markets?,"Miguel Acosta-Henao, Andrés Fernández, Patricia Gomez-Gonzalez & Ṣebnem Kalemli-Özcan","Using comprehensive administrative data on Chilean firms, we examine whether credit lines and government-backed credit guarantees mitigated the impact of the large sudden stop event during the pandemic—the abrupt withdrawal of international capital. Our analysis employs a regression discontinuity design to demonstrate that firms eligible for these programs increased their borrowing from domestic lenders at a relatively lower cost. By reducing the cost of domestic currency debt relative to foreign currency debt, these policies effectively lowered the relative cost of domestic capital in the short term. This reduction in borrowing costs is conditional on selection effects at both the firm and bank levels, where only policy-eligible firms benefit from the lower credit costs from the same lender that non-eligible firms also borrow from. An open economy model with heterogeneous firms and financial frictions helps explain our findings: government interventions eased the higher cost of capital during the sudden stop by relaxing firms’ domestic collateral constraints, which in turn reduced domestic financial intermediaries’ risk aversion and boosted the supply of domestic credit in the face of shrinking international capital flows.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33283,33283,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Dissertation Paths: Advisors and Students in the Economics Research Production Function,Joshua Angrist & Marc Diederichs,"Elite economics PhD programs aim to train graduate students for a lifetime of academic research. This paper asks how advising affects graduate students’ post-PhD research productivity. Advising is highly concentrated: at the eight highly-selective schools in our study, a minority of advisors do most of the advising work. We quantify advisor characteristics such as an advisor’s own research output and aspects of the advising relationship like coauthoring and research field affinity that might contribute to student research success. Students advised by research-active, prolific advisors tend to publish more, while coauthoring has no effect. Student-advisor research affinity also predicts student success. But a school-level aggregate production function provides much weaker evidence of causal effects, suggesting that successful advisors attract students likely to succeed–without necessarily boosting their students’ chances of success. Evidence for causal effects is strongest for a measure of advisors’ own research output. Aggregate student research output appears to scale linearly with graduate student enrollment, with no evidence of negative class-size effects. An analysis of gender differences in research output shows male and female graduate students to be equally productive in the first few years post-PhD, but female productivity peaks sooner than male productivity.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33281,33281,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Optimal Income Tax Deductions for Mixed Business and Personal Expenditures,"Jacob Goldin, Sebastian Koehne & Nicholas Lawson","We study the optimal taxation of expenditures that generate income while also serving a consumption function. We characterize the Pareto optimal income tax deduction for such mixed-purpose expenditures within a generalized Atkinson-Stiglitz model. Pareto optimality requires a partial deduction for mixed-purpose expenditures, where the deduction rate depends on the fraction of an expenditure’s marginal benefits that are attributable to income-generation rather than consumption. We extend our results to account for several practical considerations, including potential constraints relating to a uniform deduction rate or a fixed income tax schedule. Our results provide a rationale for non-uniform commodity taxation, distinct from existing models of preference heterogeneity or non-separability.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33270,33270,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Winners and Losers from the Work-from-Home Technology Boon,"Morris A. Davis, Andra C. Ghent & Jesse M. Gregory","We model how an increase in Work-from-Home (WFH) productivity differentially affects workers using a framework in which some workers cannot work offsite, some are hybrid, and some are completely remote.  The improvement in WFH productivity increases housing demand and thus housing prices since housing is inelastically supplied.  Because workers in non-telecommutable occupations must consume housing but their total factor productivity does not increase,  the rise in house prices reduces their welfare. The welfare decline is equivalent to 1-9% of consumption, depending on how substitutable WFH is with onsite work, and it arises despite measured income of all workers increasing.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33284,33284,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
The Relationship between Officer Misconduct and Conviction-less Arrests,"Bocar A. Ba, Nayoung Rim & Roman Rivera","Given the use of an individual’s arrest history for many economic and social outcomes, reducing conviction‐less arrests (arrests that result in no charges or where the defendant is found not guilty) is an important policy goal. This paper examines which officers are making conviction‐less arrests, and whether these arrests can be reduced with increased oversight. Using the Chicago Police Department’s rotational duty calendar to obtain plausibly exogenous variation in the set of officers assigned to work on a particular day, we find that arrests made by officers with high misconduct are 10.5% less likely than the arrests made by no‐misconduct officers to result in charges and are 14% more likely to have a “Not Guilty” outcome. We also analyze two events that increased the transparency of police misconduct through public disclosure of complaint records and find that increased oversight reduces conviction‐less arrests, but with important nuances across misconduct profiles. While no‐ and low‐misconduct officers are responsive to oversight mechanisms, high‐misconduct officers are less responsive.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33276,33276,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Child Disability and Effects on Sibling Mental Health,"Janet Currie, N. Meltem Daysal, Mette Gørtz & Jonas Cuzulan Hirani","Mental health disorders are the leading cause of childhood disability worldwide. We examine the impact of a relatively common household stressor on child mental health: the presence of a younger sibling with a physical disability. Using Danish administrative data from families with at least 3 children, we focus on differences between first and second born children in families with and without a 3rd child with a disability. Second-born children in these families spend a larger fraction of their early childhood in families that may be under stress. We find that second-born children are 11 percent more likely to use mental health services than first-born children. There is a 19% increase in psychiatric visits and a 16% increase in use of psychiatric medications. These results are confirmed by matching models.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33303,33303,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
The Mental Health of the Young in Africa,David G. Blanchflower & Alex Bryson,"Growing evidence from around the world suggests the mental health of children and young adults is declining.  We examine trends in mental health in  Africa where there has been little prior work.  We examine data from a number of surveys including Afrobarometers, the Gallup World Poll, the World Values Surveys, UNICEF’s Multiple Cluster Indicator Surveys and Global Minds.  We find little support for the proposition that  the age structure of wellbeing in Africa has changed over the last decade, although  the Global Minds surveys, conducted over the internet, do find mental health improves with age.  One potential reason for this is the limited amount of internet access in Africa, especially for women.  In countries like Burkina Faso and Guinea the majority of the population say they have never accessed the internet.  In a new survey in  rural Tanzania, where there is little or no internet access,  mental health improves with age.  The absence of the internet might help explain why the mental health of young Africans have been declining less than elsewhere other than for the internet savvy. However, there are dangers on the horizon as the sales of smartphones explode in Africa.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33280,33280,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Phoning Home: The Procurement of Telecommunications for Incarcerated Individuals in the United States,"Marleen R. Marra, Nathan H. Miller & Gretchen Sileo","Incarcerated individuals in the U.S. purchase goods and services from monopoly vendors selected by their correctional authority. We study telecommunications, which have come under bipartisan scrutiny due to the high prices inmates pay for phone calls. Prospective providers are evaluated on their technical capabilities, the prices they would charge, and the “commission” they would pay the correctional authority. Using data from public records requests, we estimate a first-score auction model with evaluation uncertainty and multi-dimensional bidder heterogeneity. The model indicates that reducing the role of commissions in procurement lowers prices, whereas increasing competition among providers mainly raises commissions. Moreover, recent federal regulations that ban commissions and cap prices likely preserve providers' profitability.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w33292,33292,December 2024,NBER,12/23/2024
Highway Procurement During the Great Recession and Stimulus,Dakshina G.

We argue that the recession reduced opportunity costs, in part due to a slump in private-sector construction. We evaluate costs and efficiency by developing methods to estimate an empirical auction model tailored for public bidding and demonstrate that contracts became more efficient and less costly.

We find that banks facing greater fintech competition are more likely to make venture investments in fintech startups. Banks target fintech firms that exhibit higher levels of asset complementarities with their own business.

Green Stocks and Monetary Policy Shocks: Evidence from Europe,"Michael Bauer, Eric Offner, Glenn D. Rudebusch","Policymakers and researchers worry that the low-carbon transition may be inadvertently delayed by higher global interest rates. To examine whether green investment is especially sensitive to interest rate increases, we consider the effect of unanticipated monetary policy changes on the equity prices of green and brown European firms. We find that brown firms, measured in terms of carbon emission levels or intensities, are more negatively affected than green firms by tighter monetary policy. This heterogeneity is robust to different monetary policy surprises, emission measures, econometric methods, and sample periods, and it is not explained by other firm characteristics.

Climate Policy and the Long-Run Interest Rate: Insights from a Simple Growth Model,"Gregory Casey, Stephie Fried, William B. Peterman","We study the impact of climate policy on the long-run real interest rate in a tractable climate-economy model based on the work of Golosov et al. (2014). When the growth rate of the carbon tax exceeds the growth rate of the price of at least one type of fossil energy, the tax reduces the long-run growth rates of consumption and investment, pushing the interest rate up. We find that if fossil energy prices are constant, a carbon tax that grows at 3.5 percent per year decreases the long-run interest by over 50 basis points. This carbon tax growth rate achieves net zero emissions at the lowest possible cost.",https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2024/12/climate-policy-and-the-long-run-interest-rate-insights-from-a-simple-growth-model,2024-37,2024-12-23,FED-SANFRANCISCO,12/24/2024
