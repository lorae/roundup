Analyzing Bounded Count Data,John Mullahy,"This paper presents and assesses analytical strategies that respect the bounded count structures of outcomes that are encountered often in health and other applications. The paper's main motivation is that the applied econometrics literature lacks a comprehensive discussion and critique of strategies for analyzing and understand such data. The paper's goal is to provide a treatment of prominent issues arising in such analyses, with particular focus on evaluations in which bounded count outcomes are of interest, and on econometric modeling of their probability and moment structures. Hopefully the paper will provide a toolkit for researchers so they may better appreciate the range of questions that might be asked of such data and the merits and limitations of the analytical methods they might contemplate to study them. It will be seen that the choice of analytical method is often consequential: questions of interest may be unanswerable when some familiar analytical methods are deployed in some circumstances.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31814,31814,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023

Assessing the Impact of Structural Reforms on Potential Output: The Case of Morocco,"Hippolyte W. Balima, Olivier Bizimana, Ananta Dua","This paper assesses Morocco’s potential output and the scope for structural reforms to reverse the downward trend in economic performance observed since the Global Financial Crisis. Using multivariate filtering (MVF) techniques, our analysis finds that the downward secular trend in potential growth was primarily driven by the decline in the contribution of labor inputs. We then combine  production function and  general equilibrium model approaches to provide estimates of the potential macroeconomic impact of Morocco’s structural reform agenda. The results suggest that the planned structural reforms could deliver sizable output gains in the medium to long term with reforms that would reduce the large gender gap in Morocco’s labor market yielding the greatest payoffs.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Assessing-the-Impact-of-Structural-Reforms-on-Potential-Output-The-Case-of-Morocco-540981,WPIEA2023222,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
China’s Nationwide CO2 Emissions Trading System: A General Equilibrium Assessment,"Lawrence H. Goulder, Xianling Long, Chenfei Qu, Da Zhang","China’s recently launched CO2 emissions trading system, already the world’s largest, aims to contribute importantly toward global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  The system, a tradable performance standard (TPS), differs importantly from cap and trade (C&T), the principal emissions trading approach used in other countries.  This paper presents the structure and results from a multi-sector, multi-period equilibrium model tailored to evaluate China’s TPS. The model incorporates distinctive features of China’s economy, including state-owned enterprises and electricity market regulation. It distinguishes between the TPS and C&T and considers a wide range of potential future TPS designs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31809,31809,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Climate Shocks in the Anthropocene Era: Should Net Domestic Product Be Affected by Climate Disasters,"Leonard Nakamura, Brian Sliker","The monetary costs of weather and climate disasters in the U.S. have grown rapidly from 1980 to 2022, rising more than 5 percent in real terms annually. Much of this real growth in costs is likely due to climate change. Regardless of its cause, these costs imply a faster depreciation of real assets. We argue that the expected depreciation from these events could be included in the consumption of fixed capital, leading to lower levels, and slightly lower growth rates, for net domestic product (NDP). We use Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood regressions to estimate this expectation and to generate our experimental measure of costs. An alternative calculation of depreciation and NDP might be derived from the time series of costs incurred rather than from the far smoother expectation. This latter series might be more appropriate for a national income satellite account. We also investigate the parametric distributions of the annual average-cost and total-cost data.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/macroeconomics/climate-shocks-in-the-anthropocene-era-should-net-domestic-product-be-affected-by-climate-disasters,23-24,24-Oct-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,10/30/2023
Corruption Kills: Global Evidence from Natural Disasters,"Serhan Cevik, João Tovar Jalles","Natural disasters are inevitable, but humanitarian and economic losses are determined largely by policy preferences and institutional underpinnings that shape the quality of public infrastructure  (including emergency responses and healthcare services) and govern business practices and the adherence to building codes. In this paper, we empirically investigate whether corruption increases the loss of human lives caused by natural disasters, using a large panel of 135 countries during the period 1980–2020. The econometric analysis provides convincing evidence that corruption increases the number of disaster-related deaths, after controlling for economic, demographic, healthcare and institutional factors. That is, the higher the level of corruption in a given country, the greater the number of fatalities as a share of population due to natural disasters. Our results show that the devastating impact of corruption on loss of human lives caused by natural disasters is significantly greater in developing countries, which are even more vulnerable to nonlinear effects of corruption.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Corruption-Kills-Global-Evidence-from-Natural-Disasters-539659,WPIEA2023220,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023

Dirty Air and Green Investments: The Impact of Pollution Information on Portfolio Allocations,"Raymond Fisman, Pulak Ghosh, Arkodipta Sarkar, Jian Zhang","We study exposure to pollution information and investment portfolio allocations, exploiting the rollout of air quality monitoring stations in India. Using a triple-differences framework, we show that retail investors' investments in ""brown"" stocks are negatively related to local air pollution after a monitoring station appears nearby, with particularly pronounced effects on ``alert'' dates when air quality is listed as harmful to the general population. The effect of pollution information on investment choices is most prominent amongst tech-savvy investors who are most plausibly ""treated"" by real-time pollution data, and by younger investors who tend to be more sensitive to environmental concerns. Overall, our results provide micro-level support for the view that salience of environmental conditions affect investors' tastes for green investments, and preferences for environmental amenities more generally.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31813,31813,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Do Household Expectations Help Predict Inflation?,"Luis Brandão-Marques, Gaston Gelos, David J Hofman, Julia Otten, Gurnain Kaur Pasricha, Zoe Strauss","We examine whether changes in the distribution of household inflation expectations contain information on future inflation. We first discuss recent shifts in micro data from the US, UK, Germany, and Canada. We then zoom in on the US to explore econometrically whether distributional characteristics help predict future inflation. We find that the shape of the distribution of household expectations does indeed help predict one-year-ahead CPI inflation. Variance and skewness of household expectations’ distributions add predictive power beyond and above the median, especially in periods of high inflation. Remarkably, qualitatively, these results hold when including market-based measures and moments of the distribution of professional forecasts.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Do-Household-Expectations-Help-Predict-Inflation-540829,WPIEA2023224,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Does Wage Theft Vary by Demographic Group? Evidence from Minimum Wage Increases,"Jeffrey Clemens, Michael R. Strain","Using Current Population Survey data, we assess whether and to what extent the burden of wage theft — wage payments below the statutory minimum wage — falls disproportionately on various demographic groups following minimum wage increases. For most racial and ethnic groups at most ages we find that underpayment rises similarly as a fraction of realized wage gains in the wake of minimum wage increases. We also present evidence that the burden of underpayment falls disproportionately on relatively young African American workers and that underpayment increases more for Hispanic workers among the full working-age population.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31818,31818,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Economic Growth under Transformative AI,"Philip Trammell, Anton Korinek","Industrialized countries have long seen relatively stable growth in output per capita and a stable labor share. AI may be transformative, in the sense that it may break one or both of these stylized facts. This review outlines the ways this may happen by placing several strands of the literature on AI and growth within a common framework. We first evaluate models in which AI increases output production, for example via increases in capital's substitutability for labor or task automation, capturing the notion that AI will let capital “self-replicate”. This typically speeds up growth and lowers the labor share. We then consider models in which AI increases knowledge production, capturing the notion that AI will let capital “self-improve”, speeding growth further. Taken as a whole, the literature suggests that sufficiently advanced AI is likely to deliver both effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31815,31815,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Environmental Consequences of Hydrocarbon Infrastructure Policy,"Thomas Covert, Ryan Kellogg","We study policies that aim to “keep carbon in the ground” by blocking fossil fuel infrastructure investment. Our analysis relies on a model of hydrocarbon production and transportation, incorporating substitution between pipeline infrastructure and flexible alternatives, like crude-byrail. We apply the model to the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which moves oil from North Dakota to Texas and was controversially completed in 2017. Had DAPL’s construction been enjoined, we estimate that 81% of the blocked pipeline flows would move by rail instead. This substitution induces both private costs and local environmental damage, since rail transport imposes greater local externalities than pipelines.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/environmental-consequences-of-hydrocarbon-infrastructure-policy/,2023-138,25-Oct-23,BFI,10/30/2023
Expectations and the neutrality of interest rates, John Cochrane,"Our central banks set interest rate targets, and do not even pretend to control money supplies.

GDP revisions are not cool: the impact of statistical agencies’ trade-oﬀ,"Stylianos Asimakopoulos, Magdalena Lalik, Joan Paredes, José Salvado García","Oﬃcial estimates of economic growth are regularly revised and therefore forecasts for GDP growth are done on the basis of ever-changing data. The economic literature has intensively studied the properties of those revisions and their implications for forecasting models. However, it is much less known about the reasons for Statistical Agencies (SAs) to revise their estimates. In order to be timely and reliable, SAs have an explicit interest in not revising their initial GDP estimates too much, while they are much more open to revise GDP components over time. More than a curiosity, we exploit this resulting cross-correlation of GDP components revisions to build a model to better forecast GDP.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2857~073085df17.en.pdf?9e3574dcc780199144161f88d7e297dc,2857,30-Oct-23,ECB,10/30/2023
Heterogeneous Agent Trade,Michael E. Waugh,"This paper studies the implications of household heterogeneity for trade. I develop a model where household heterogeneity is induced via incomplete markets and results in heterogeneous price elasticities. Conditional on exposure to trade, heterogeneous price elasticities imply that different households value price changes differently, and thus rich and poor households experience different gains from trade. I calibrate the model to match bilateral trade flows and micro-facts about household-level expenditure patterns and elasticities. I find gains from trade that are pro-poor and that the average gains from trade are substantially larger than representative agent benchmarks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31810,31810,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Hidden Exposure: Measuring US Supply Chain Reliance,"Richard Baldwin, Rebecca Freeman, Angelos Theodorakopoulos","Supply chain problems, previously relegated to specialized journals, now appear in G7 Leaders’ Communiqués. Our paper looks at three core elements of the problems: measurement of the links that expose supply chains to disruptions, the nature of the shocks that cause the disruptions, and the criteria for policy to mitigate the impact of disruptions. Utilizing global input-output data, we show that US exposure to foreign suppliers, and particularly to China, is ‘hidden’ in the sense that it is much larger than what conventional trade data suggest. However, at the macro level, exposure remains relatively modest, given that over 80% of US industrial inputs are sourced domestically. We argue that many recent shocks to supply chains have been systemic rather than idiosyncratic. Moreover, systemic shocks are likely to arise from climate change, geoeconomic tensions, and digital disruptions. Our principal conclusion is that concerns regarding supply chain disruptions, and policies to address them, should focus on individual products, rather than the whole manufacturing sector.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31820,31820,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
How Does Medicaid Expansion Impact Income Support Program Participation and Employment for Different Types of People with Disabilities?,"Ari Ne&#039;eman, Nicole Maestas","Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income, the United States’ two primary disability income support programs, each offer a pathway to public health insurance in addition to cash benefits. This implies that expansions in public health insurance availability, such as the ACA’s Medicaid expansions, may impact disability program participation and employment of people with disabilities. However, prior research has yielded mixed results as to the impact of Medicaid expansion on these outcomes. Using a stacked difference-in-differences design and data from the Current Population Survey, we demonstrate that the ACA’s Medicaid expansions increased SSDI receipt among individuals ages 50-64 with physical, self-care and independent living disabilities, consistent with a “job unlock” mechanism. Exploiting the longitudinal nature of the CPS, we show that treatment effects are heterogeneous and concentrated among persons with ongoing disabilities (as opposed to new disabilities) as reported on the CPS’s 6-question functional impairment sequence. We also show suggestive evidence of a reduction in SSI, but find that it is sensitive to specification and data preparation choices, which we illustrate through comparison with other recent work. Effects on employment are inconclusive. Our findings provide further evidence of work capacity among SSDI beneficiaries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31816,31816,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Impacts of Home-Care Subsidies: Evidence from Quasi-Random Assignment,"Yuval Ofek-Shanny, Avner Strulov-Shlain, Dan Zeltzer","We study the impact of subsidizing home-based long-term care on recipients’ health and the labor supply of their working-age children. We use administrative data from Israel on the universe of welfare benefit applications linked with tax records of applicants and their adult children. To address the endogeneity of benefit recipients’ health status, we instrument for benefit receipt using the leniency of randomly assigned evaluators who assess the applicant’s functional status and determine benefit eligibility. We find that for compliers – applicants who receive subsidies only from more lenient evaluators – subsidizing home-based care has large adverse effects on recipient health but no detectable effects on the labor market outcomes of their children. The results are consistent with the crowd-out of self-care for the marginal recipient, highlighting the need to assess the heterogeneous effects of home-care subsidies.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/impacts-of-home-care-subsidies-evidence-from-quasi-random-assignment/,2023-139,24-Oct-23,BFI,10/30/2023
Inclusive GovTech: Enhancing Efficiency and Equity Through Public Service Digitalization,Manabu Nose,"How could the GovTech improve budget processes and execution efficiency? Could the GovTech strengthen redistributive function of public expenditure? Based on an event-study method, this paper finds that the introduction of digital budget payments and e-procurement could significantly enhance budget transparency and help expand the coverage of social assistance to reach the most vulnerable population. Exploiting staggered adoption of digital budget payments, a synthetic control regression identifies meaningful increase in pre-tax income shares among the bottom 50th percentile and female workers, especially for emerging market and developing countries, with effects materializing gradually over 10-year period. The paper delves into the potential mechanism driving these equity benefits, highlighting the reduction in business informality as a primary channel. However, the paper emphasizes that the mere adoption of GovTech strategies or digital technologies is insufficient to unlock its full potential. The outcomes are intricately linked to supporting policies, regulations, organizational and system integration, and robust digital connectivity. The paper underscores that inter-agency coordination facilitated by a dedicated GovTech institution emerges as a critical factor for reaping both efficiency and equity gains from GovTech initiatives.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Inclusive-GovTech-Enhancing-Efficiency-and-Equity-Through-Public-Service-Digitalization-540984,WPIEA2023226,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023

Laffer’s Day in Court: The Revenue Effects  of Criminal Justice Fees and Fines,"Samuel Norris, Evan K.

Proponents argue LFOs are a “tax on crime” that funds courts and provides deterrence; opponents argue they do neither. We examine the fiscal implications of lowering LFOs. Incentives to default generate a “Laffer” curve with revenue eventually decreasing in LFOs. Using detailed administrative data, however, we find few defendants demonstrably on the right-hand side of the curve. Those who are tend to be poor, Black, and charged with felonies.

Long Live Globalization: Geopolitical Shocks and International Trade,Serhan Cevik,"Are we really witnessing the death of globalization? A multitude of shocks over the past three years has unsettled the conventional wisdom on economic integration and fueled widespread calls for protectionist and nationalist policies. Using an extensive dataset with more than 4 million observations, I develop an augmented gravity model of bilateral trade flows among 59,049 country-pairs over the period 1948–2021 and find that the much-debated geopolitical alignment between countries has contradictory and statistically insignificant effects on trade, depending on the level of economic development. Moreover, the economic magnitude of this effect is not as important as income or geographic distance and it diminishes significantly when extreme outliers are removed from the sample. The empirical analysis presented in this paper also confirms that the level of income in both origin and destination countries has a positive impact on trade, while the greater the distance between countries, the smaller the flow of bilateral trade due to higher trade costs. Cultural similarities and historical ties are also important in shaping trade flows, just like trade agreements that tend to lead to higher level of international trade.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Long-Live-Globalization-Geopolitical-Shocks-and-International-Trade-540832,WPIEA2023225,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Micro-Assessment of Macroprudential Borrower-Based Measures in Lithuania,"Mantas Dirma, Jaunius Karmelavičius","Despite having introduced borrower-based measures (BBM), Lithuania's housing and mortgage markets were booming during the low-interest-rate period, casting doubt on the macroprudential toolkit's ability to contain excessive mortgage growth. This paper assesses the adequacy of BBMs’ parametrization in Lithuania. We do so by building a novel lifetime expected credit loss framework that is founded on actual loan-level default and household income data. We show that the BBM package effectively contains mortgage credit risk and that housing loans are more resilient to stress than in the preregulatory era. Our BBM limit calibration exercise reveals that (1) in the low-rate environment, income-based measures could have been tighter; and (2) borrowers taking out secondary mortgages rightly are and should be required to pledge a higher down payment.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Micro-Assessment-of-Macroprudential-Borrower-Based-Measures-in-Lithuania-540987,WPIEA2023227,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Public Support for Climate Change Mitigation Policies: A Cross Country Survey,"Era Dabla-Norris, Salma Khalid, Giacomo Magistretti, Alexandre Sollaci","Building public support for climate mitigation is a key prerequisite to making meaningful strides toward decarbonization and achieving net-zero emissions. Using nationally representative, individual-level surveys for 28 countries, this paper identifies the current levels and drivers of support for climate mitigation policies. Controlling for individual characteristics, we find that pre-existing beliefs about policy efficacy, perceived costs and co-benefits (e.g., cleaner air), and the degree of policy progressivity are important drivers of support for carbon pricing policies. The knowledge gap about climate mitigation policies can be large, but randomized information experiments show that support increases (decreases) after individuals are introduced to new information on the benefits (potential costs) of such policies.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Public-Support-for-Climate-Change-Mitigation-Policies-A-Cross-Country-Survey-540823,WPIEA2023223,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Semiparametric Conditional Factor Models: Estimation and Inference,"Qihui Chen, Nikolai Roussanov, Xiaoliang Wang","This paper introduces a simple and tractable sieve estimation of semiparametric conditional factor models with latent factors. We establish large-N-asymptotic properties of the estimators without requiring large T. We also develop a simple bootstrap procedure for conducting inference about the conditional pricing errors as well as the shapes of the factor loading functions. These results enable us to estimate conditional factor structure of a large set of individual assets by utilizing arbitrary nonlinear functions of a number of characteristics without the need to pre-specify the factors, while allowing us to disentangle the characteristics' role in capturing factor betas from alphas (i.e., undiversifiable risk from mispricing). We apply these methods to the cross-section of individual U.S. stock returns and find strong evidence of large nonzero pricing errors that combine to produce arbitrage portfolios with Sharpe ratios above 3. We also document a significant decline in apparent mispricing over time.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31817,31817,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Social Insurance and Migration: Evidence from a Nation-Wide Institutional Reform in China,"Fanghua Li, Chenyang Ji, Moshe Buchinsky","In this paper we examine the causal relationship between formal social insurance and individuals’ migration decisions. We exploit a quasi experimental design in rural China, under which county officials were assigned to a group of villages (i.e., treated villages) to serve as village supervisors (VSs) for the local leaders. We show that this led to reduced favoritism in welfare allocation by the local leaders, thereby increasing the efficacy in the formal social insurance in the treated villages. We use detailed geo-referenced administrative household-level data suited for a spatial regression discontinuity design (RDD) to obtain an average treatment effect (LATE) of the improved social insurance on migration. The apparent variation in the implementation of the reform across treated villages and heterogeneous impacts on different family clans make it possible to directly link changes in the efficacy of the insurance to migration choices. We find a large positive migration effect, of about 19%, for the young males and females. In turn, this led to a large boost in the average household’s income in just two years.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31819,31819,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
"Social Unrests and Fuel Prices: The Role of Macroeconomic, Social and Institutional Factors","Alassane Drabo, Kodjovi M. Eklou, Patrick A.

Using the IV fixed-effect estimator on a sample of 101 developing countries during 2001-2020, we find that changes in fuel prices are positively associated with the number of social unrests, mainly anti-government demonstrations. This impact is however amplified: (i) during economic downturns and periods of high exchange rate instability; (ii) when government spending is low, especially on health and education, thus suggesting that streamlining fuel subsides and diverting parts of the reform savings to the health and education sectors is an appropriate policy that could appease social tensions; (iii) in countries with high income inequality, low institutional quality and high level of corruption. The results are robust to a battery of tests, including the use of an instrumental variable approach to address reverse causality concerns given that social unrests could also prompt a freeze in fuel prices. We also find consistent results using either changes in diesel or gasoline prices. Overall, the findings of the paper provide support to the grievance and deprivation theory in explaining the association between fuel price increases and social unrests, but fail to find evidence for the resource theory and the theory of political opportunities.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Social-Unrests-and-Fuel-Prices-The-Role-of-Macroeconomic-Social-and-Institutional-Factors-539677,WPIEA2023228,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023

Nevertheless, the impact of this campaign on all-cause mortality is not well understood. Leveraging the staggered rollout of vaccines, we find that the vaccination campaign across 141 countries averted 2.4 million excess deaths, valued at $6.5 trillion. We also find that an equitable counterfactual distribution of vaccines, with vaccination in each country proportional to its population, would have saved roughly 670,000 more lives. However, this distribution approach would have reduced the total value of averted deaths by $1.8 trillion due to redistribution of vaccines from high-income to low-income countries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31812,31812,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
The Topography of Nations,Treb Allen,"How does the interplay of geography and political-economic forces affect the shape of nations? This paper presents a quantitative framework for characterizing the equilibrium evolution of national boundaries in a world with a rich geography. The framework delivers simple equilibrium conditions based on the efficient transportation of resources that arise from disparate political economic micro-foundations. I characterize the existence, uniqueness, and efficiency of the equilibrium and provide a simple algorithm for its calculation. When combined with detailed spatial geography data from Europe, the equilibrium conditions well approximate observed borders, and the framework is able to successfully predict the evolution of national boundaries and resulting conflict over the past millennia. Finally, I apply the framework to ask how the changing spatial distribution of resources arising from climate change may alter European borders in the future, finding that the Crimean peninsula and surrounding area is especially susceptible.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31795,31795,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Using Macro Counterfactuals to Assess Plausibility: An Illustration using the 2001 Rebate MPCs,"Jacob Orchard, Valerie A. Ramey, Johannes Wieland","Macroeconomics has increasingly adopted tools from the applied micro “credibility revolution” to estimate micro parameters that can inform macro questions. In this paper, we argue that researchers should take advantage of this confluence of micro and macro to take the credibility revolution one step further. We argue that researchers should assess the plausibility of the micro estimates and macro models by constructing macro counterfactuals for historical periods and comparing these counterfactuals with reasonable benchmarks. We illustrate this approach by conducting a case study of the 2001 U.S. tax rebates, as well as briefly summarizing two previous applications of the methodology. In the 2001 rebate case, we calibrate a two-good, two-agent New Keynesian model with the leading estimates of the household marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of the rebates to construct a counterfactual path for nondurable consumption. The counterfactual path implies that without the tax rebate nondurable consumption spending would have fallen dramatically in the late summer and fall of 2001. Using forecasting regressions and other evidence, we argue that this counterfactual is implausible. When we investigate the source of the discrepancy, we find that the leading MPC estimates are not representative of the response of total consumption.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31808,31808,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Value Added Tax in the Extractive Industries,"Artur Swistak, Nate Vernon","Lower capacity countries often struggle to administer the Value Added Tax (VAT) in the extractive industries, partly due to the large VAT refunds needs of this capital and export-intensive sector. Assuming that the first-best policy (apply the standard VAT to the extractive industry) is not possible in the medium-term, what should countries do? This paper systemically analyzes second-best VAT policy designs considering the impact of the VAT on three key stakeholders: the investor, domestic suppliers, and the tax administration. The analysis concludes that the generally preferred policy is to provide a VAT exemption for imports and either fully tax or exempt domestic supplies, although country characteristics (and, specifically the relative weighting of stakeholders) matter. Moreover, governments should make efforts to shorten refund delays and transition to a standard VAT over the longer-term.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Value-Added-Tax-in-the-Extractive-Industries-540826,WPIEA2023221,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Wars and the Labor Market Outcomes of Minorities in the U.S.,Andreas Ferrara,"This chapter reviews key literature studying the effects of wars on minority and underrepresented groups in U.S. labor markets in the 20th century. These labor markets, characterized by historically pervasive barriers to entry into certain occupations and industries, promotions, and fair pay for underrepresented workers, experienced severe challenges during times of war. These challenges served to break down some of the barriers faced by underrepresented workers. Recent years have shown that sudden labor shortages, similar to those induced by large-scale wars, are not a feature of the past. Hence, a better understanding of such shortages and their effects on different groups continues to be important. The focus here is on the labor market outcomes of Black and white women, as well as Black men, during and after the two World Wars. Their labor inputs compensated for the lack of white male workers during the war years; however, only WWII generated significant and more prolonged socioeconomic progress for both groups. This chapter summarizes theoretical considerations that can explain why some war-induced labor market shocks are persistent while others are not, and the empirical literature related to the labor market experiences of women and Black workers during and after the World Wars.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31811,31811,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
When Institutions Interact: How the Effects of Unemployment Insurance are Shaped by Retirement Policies,"Matthew Gudgeon, Pablo Guzman, Johannes F. Schmieder, Simon Trenkle, Han Ye","This paper shows empirically that the non-employment effects of unemployment insurance (UI) for older workers depend in a first-order way on the structure of retirement policies. Using German data, we first present reduced-form evidence of these interactions, documenting large bunching in UI inflows at the age that allows workers to claim their pension following UI expiration. We then estimate a dynamic life-cycle model and use it to directly quantify how the effects of UI vary with retirement policies. Accounting for interactions across UI and retirement institutions also helps explain otherwise difficult-to-explain trends in the unemployment rate of older German workers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31807,31807,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Why Is Tunisia’s Unemployment So High? Evidence From Policy Factors,"Aymen Belgacem, Jérôme Vacher","Tunisia has one of the highest unemployment rates within the Middle East and Central Asia. We look at the extent to which institutional factors explain those high unemployment levels. We also assess unemployment cyclicality, by looking at the determinants of labor market sensitivity to the output gap. We find that during the last decade the deterioration of institutional factors that affect labor demand explain not only about a quarter of the unemployment rate increase in Tunisia, but also Tunisia’s excess sensitivity of unemployment to the output gap. Our results suggest that an improved business environment and product market competition, increased labor market flexibility as well as reduced financial constraints and informality would help reduce Tunisia’s unemployment.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Why-Is-Tunisias-Unemployment-So-High-Evidence-From-Policy-Factors-539628,WPIEA2023219,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023

China’s footprint in global financial markets,"David Lodge, Ana-Simona Manu, Ine Van Robays","Using daily data since 2017, we disentangle China-specific structural shocks driving Chinese financial markets and examine spillovers across global markets. The novelty of this paper consists of simultaneously identifying China shocks with shocksemanating from the United States and shocks to global risk sentiment – two major forces driving global financial markets – to ensure that China spillover estimates do not reflect common factors. Our results show that shocks originating in China havematerial impacts on global equity markets, although spillovers are much smaller than those following shocks in the United States, or those triggered by shifts in global risk sentiment. By contrast, shocks from China account for a significant proportion of variation in global commodity prices, more on a par with those of the United States.

Endogenous Labor Supply in an Estimated New-Keynesian Model: Nominal versus Real Rigidities,"Isabel Cairo, Hess Chung, Francesco Ferrante, Cristina Fuentes-Albero, Camilo Morales-Jimenez, Damjan Pfajfar","The deep deterioration in the labor market during the Great Recession, the subsequent slow recovery, and the missing disinflation are hard to reconcile for standard macroeconomic models. We develop and estimate a New-Keynesian model with financial frictions, search and matching frictions in the labor market, and endogenous intensive and extensive labor supply decisions. We conclude that the estimated combination of the low degree of nominal wage rigidities and high degree of real wage rigidities, together with the small role of pre-match costs relative to post-match costs, are key in successfully forecasting the slow recovery in unemployment and the missing disinflation in the aftermath of the Great Recession. We find that endogenous labor supply data are very informative about the relative degree of nominal and real wage rigidities and the slope of the Phillips curve.

"Pollution havens? Carbon taxes, globalization, and the geography of emissions","Christofer Schroeder, Livio Stracca","This paper studies the impact of national carbon taxes on CO2 emissions. To do so, we run local projections on a cross-country panel dataset, matching measures of emissions of carbon dioxide with information on the introduction of carbon taxes and their implied price. Importantly, we consider both measures of territorial emissions — emissions emitted within a country’s borders — and consumption emissions — emissions emitted anywhere in the world to satisfy domestic demand. We find that carbon taxes reduce territorial emissions over time, but have no significant effect on consumption emissions. Our estimates are robust to propensity-score weighting adjustments and are driven by countries which are more open to trade. Carbon taxes also lead to a modest increase in imports, suggesting that international trade may imply a negative carbon externality. Together, our findings highlight the limitations of national carbon taxes in isolation and the importance of international cooperation in reducing global emissions.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2862~47f293b3f5.en.pdf?f6cd1ae7d0b87e7249261ba83d13fc26,2862,3-Nov-23,ECB,11/3/2023

An Alternative Measure of Core Inflation:  The Trimmed Persistence PCE Price Index,John O'Trakoun,"I introduce the ""trimmed persistence PCE,"" a new measure of core inflation in which component prices are weighted according to the time-varying persistence of their price changes. The components of trimmed persistence personal consumption expenditures (PCE) display less tendency to mechanically pass-through the level of the prior period's inflation to the current period; thus, the impact of the current stance of monetary policy and real economic factors are more likely to be visible in recent trimmed persistence inflation compared to headline inflation. Trimmed persistence inflation performs comparably to existing popular measures of core inflation in terms of volatility and relationship with economic slack. Model selection procedures confirm trimmed persistence PCE contributes additional information to inflation forecasting models when stacked against other popular measures of core inflation. Applying the new index in a Taylor rule analysis suggests the Fed's aggressive path of federal funds rate hikes during the pandemic may have achieved appropriately restrictive levels by the fourth quarter of 2022, clearing the way for more measured policy adjustment thereafter as risks of policy overshooting became more salient.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-10,23-10,27-Oct-23,FED-RICHMOND,11/3/2023

Meyer, James Bessen, Mathew Russell","Experts in the System of National Accounts (SNA) recently considered whether marketing could be included as a capital asset in the national accounts and later recommended that marketing should be an intangible in the 2025 SNA (IMF, 2022; IMF, 2023). This paper contributes to that discussion by developing macroeconomic measures of marketing investments and stocks for the United States. We also construct and analyze measures of how marketing and other intangibles contribute to output growth in the 61 industries that comprise the U.S. private business sector.We find that marketing contributes approximately as much to output growth as software and R&D (research and development) do. From 1987 to 2020, our preferred estimates of the annual contribution to output growth are 0.15 percentage point for R&D, 0.19 for software, and 0.18 for marketing. Software grows more rapidly, whereas marketing has a larger factor share. Marketing contributes even more to output if quality is adjusted to allow for better targeting associated with digital advertising.

Help wanted: the drivers and implications of labour shortages,"Martin Groiss, David Sondermann","Labour shortages have become prevalent across advanced economies. Yet, little is known about which firms are more likely to face them and the impact they have on the labour market. We create a firm-level data set spanning 28 EU countries, 283 regions and 18 sectors, contributing to close this gap. We find that structural factors play the dominant role. Firms in regions with limited labour supply as well as innovative and fast-growing firms are particularly prone to face labour shortages. Moreover, shortages tend to aggravate at business cycle peaks. In a second stage, we empirically determine the impact of labour shortages on wages and hiring. Firms with higher shortages pay a wage growth premium to keep and attract workers, increasingly so if they face excess demand. At the same time, those are the firms that hire less than the average.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2863~c22e538d33.en.pdf?724eb7da06eccc2cf9b60a16edee50be,2863,3-Nov-23,ECB,11/3/2023

We show that there is a wide range of outcomes on the financial system and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that could reasonably occur following CBDC issuance. Our analysis highlights that the potential effects on the financial sector depend critically on how the Fed manages its balance sheet. In particular, CBDC could in principle put substantial upward pressure on the spread of the federal funds rate and other wholesale funding rates over the interest rate on reserves unless the Fed expanded its balance sheet to accommodate CBDC issuance.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-effects-of-cbdc-on-the-federal-reserves-balance-sheet.htm,2023-068,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/3/2023

A Comprehensive Macroeconomic Uncertainty Measure for the Euro Area and its Implications to COVID-19,"Mariarosaria Comunale, Anh D. M.

The measure is constructed as the conditional volatility of the unforecastable components of a large set of time series, accounting for the monetary union as well as cross-country heterogeneity. MEU exhibits the largest spike at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak and is noticeably different from other more financial-oriented and policy-driven uncertainty measures. It also reveals a significant increase in inflation uncertainty in 2021-2022. Our BVAR-based analysis shows that an unexpected increase in the MEU has a negative and persistent impact on euro area's industrial production, accounting for 80 percent of its reduction during the first wave of COVID-19, therefore supporting the interpretation of COVID-19 shock as a macroeconomic uncertainty shock. Public debt increases in response to this uncertainty shock.

Forecasters update their perceptions about the Fed’s policy rule in response to monetary policy actions, measured by high-frequency interest rate surprises, suggesting that they have imperfect information about this rule.

Tax Policy and Investment in a Global Economy,"Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, Matthew Smith, Owen Zidar, Eric Zwick","This paper combines administrative tax data and a model of global investment behavior to evaluate the investment and firm valuation effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, the largest corporate tax reduction in the history of the United States. We extend the canonical model of Hall and Jorgenson (1967) to a multinational setting in which a firm produces in domestic and international locations. We use the model to characterize and measure four determinants of domestic investment: domestic and foreign marginal tax rates and cost-of-capital subsidies. We estimate elasticities of domestic investment with respect to each and use them to identify the structural parameters of our model, to quantify which parts of the reform mattered most to investment, and to conduct policy counterfactuals. We have five main findings. First, the TCJA caused domestic investment of firms with the mean tax change to increase by roughly 20% relative to firms experiencing no tax change. Second, the TCJA created large incentives for some U.S. multinationals to increase foreign capital, which rose substantially following the law change. Third, domestic investment also increases in response to foreign incentives, indicating complementarity between domestic and foreign capital in production. Fourth, the general equilibrium long-run effects of the TCJA on the domestic and total capital of U.S. firms are around 6% and 9%, respectively. Finally, in our model, the dynamic labor and corporate tax revenue feedback in the first 10 years is less than 2% of baseline corporate revenue, as investment growth causes both higher labor tax revenues from wage growth and offsetting corporate revenue declines from more depreciation deductions. Consequently, the fall in total corporate tax revenue from the tax cut is close to the static effect.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/tax-policy-and-investment-in-a-global-economy/,2023-141,2-Nov-23,BFI,11/5/2023
Accounting for Goodwill,"Stefan J. Huber, Charles McClure","A significant portion of a merger’s purchase price is allocated to goodwill. Currently, goodwill is not amortized but tested annually for impairment. When managers care about earnings, goodwill’s accounting treatment can have large effects on future earnings and may influence how much a manager will bid for a target company. We quantify the effects of goodwill accounting by estimating a structural model of corporate takeovers. Our estimates suggest that accrual accounting increases buyout premia by an average of nearly 10 percentage points. If firms needed to amortize goodwill over 10 years, we estimate premia would reduce by 6 percentage points and M&A volume would shrink by 4.29% or $68.6 billion per year. Furthermore, the fraction of private equity acquirers increases by 7.74 percentage points, shifting control over productive assets to the private and financial sector.

The Impact of Fake Reviews on Demand and Welfare,"Jesper Akesson, Robert W. Hahn, Robert D. Metcalfe, Manuel Monti-Nussbaum","Although fake online customer reviews have become prevalent on platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, little is known about how these reviews influence consumer behavior. This paper provides the first experimental estimates of the effects of fake reviews on individual demand and welfare. We conduct an incentive-compatible online experiment with a nationally representative sample of respondents from the United Kingdom (n = 10,000). Consumers are asked to choose a product category, browse a platform resembling Amazon, and select one of five equally priced products. One of the products is of inferior quality, one is of superior quality, and three are of average quality. We randomly allocate participants to variants of the platform: five treatment groups see positive fake reviews for an inferior product, and the control group does not see fake reviews. Moreover, some participants are randomly selected to receive an educational intervention that aims to mitigate the potential effects of fake reviews. Our analysis of the experimental data yields four findings. First, fake reviews make consumers more likely to choose lower-quality products. Second, we estimate that welfare losses from such reviews may be important—on the order of $.12 for each dollar spent in the setting we study. Third, we find that fake reviews have heterogeneous effects. For example, the effect of fake reviews is smaller for those who do not trust customer reviews. Fake reviews also have larger effects on those who shop online more frequently. Fourth, we show that the educational intervention reduces the adverse welfare impact of fake reviews by 44%.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31836,31836,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023

Long-term Care in Japan,"Rong Fu, Toshiaki Iizuka, Haruko Noguchi","Japan, renowned for its significantly aged population, presents a distinctive landscape in elderly care. Notably, there exists no apparent correlation between the economic well-being of the elderly and the limitations they experience in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). In response to the escalating demand for elderly care, Japan introduced the public Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) system in 2000. This comprehensive program offers a wide spectrum of long-term care services, aiming to facilitate aging in place for seniors and alleviate the burdens on informal caregivers. Nevertheless, the LTCI system faces substantial challenges, predominantly related to financial sustainability and a shortage of human resources. Ongoing discussions center on achieving cost-effective service delivery, potential adjustments to premium rates and copayments, especially for individuals with ample financial resources or minimal care needs. Furthermore, debates surround the reduction of the age of eligibility for LTCI, with opposition stemming from intricate financial and structural considerations.

Asset Pricing in a Low Rate Environment,"Marlon Azinovic, Harold L. Cole, Felix Kubler","We examine asset prices in environments where the risk-free rate lies considerably below the growth rate. To do so, we introduce a tractable model of a production economy featuring heterogeneous trading  technologies, as well as idiosyncratic and aggregate risk. We show that allowing for the possibility of firms exiting is crucial for matching key macroeconomic moments and, simultaneously, the risk-free rate, the market price of risk, and price-earnings ratios. In particular, our model allows us to consider calibrations that match the high observed market price of risk and average interest rates as low as 2-3.5 percent below the average growth rate.  High values for risk aversion or non-standard preferences are not necessary for this. We use the model to examine the wealth distribution and asset prices in economies with very low real rates. We also examine under which conditions realistic calibrations allow for an infinite rollover of government debt. For our benchmark calibration, rollover is impossible even if the average risk-free rate lies 3.5 percent below the average growth rate.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31832,31832,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
Risk Preferences Implied by Synthetic Options,"Ian Dew-Becker, Stefano Giglio","The historical returns on equity index options are well known to be strikingly negative. That is typically explained either by investors having convex marginal utility over stock returns (e.g. crash/variance aversion) or by intermediaries demanding a premium for hedging risk. This paper examines the consistency of those explanations with returns on dynamically replicated, or synthetic, options. Theoretically, it derives conditions under which convex marginal utility leads synthetic options to also have negative excess returns. Empirically, synthetic options have CAPM alphas near zero over the period 1926--2022, in stark contrast to exchange-traded options. Over the last 15 years, returns on traded options have converged to those on synthetic options -- with the variance risk premium shrinking towards zero -- while various drivers of the cost and risk of hedging options exposures have declined, consistent with a model in which intermediaries drive option prices.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31833,31833,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
Lagged-Price Reimbursement Contracts: The Impact of Medicare Part B on Pharmaceutical Price Growth,"Angelique Acquatella, Keith Marzilli Ericson, Amanda Starc","We examine cost-plus lagged-price reimbursement contracts, focusing on Medicare Part B's payment for physician-administered drugs. Our theoretical model shows that lagged-price reimbursement can raise launch prices but lower prices in later periods. While previous research showed Part B increased launch prices, we estimate its effect on later prices (net of rebates). Drugs more exposed to Medicare have lower price growth. A drug with above median Part B exposure has a 10% lower price after 3 years than a below median exposure drug that launched at the same price, with a larger effect for newly approved molecules.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31834,31834,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
"Fiscal Influences on Inflation in OECD Countries, 2020-2022","Robert J. Barro, Francesco Bianchi","The fiscal theory of the price level (FTPL) has been active for 30 years, and the interest in this theory grew with the recent global surges in inflation and government spending.  This study applies the FTPL to 37 OECD countries for 2020-2022.  The theory’s centerpiece is the government’s intertemporal budget constraint, which relates a country’s inflation rate in 2020 2022 (relative to a baseline rate) to a composite government-spending variable.  This variable equals the cumulative increase in the ratio of government expenditure to GDP from 2020 to 2022, divided by the ratio of public debt to GDP in 2019 and the duration of the debt in 2019.  This specification has substantial explanatory power for recent inflation rates across 20 non-Euro-zone countries and an aggregate of 17 Euro-zone countries.  The estimated coefficients of the composite spending variable are significantly positive, implying that 40-50% of effective government financing came from the inverse effect of unexpected inflation on the real value of public debt, whereas 50 60% reflected conventional public finance (increases in current or future taxes or cuts in future spending).  Within the Euro area, inflation reacts mostly to the area-wide government-spending variable, not to individual values.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31838,31838,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
Long-term care in the Netherlands,"Pieter Bakx, Eddy Van Doorslaer, Bram Wouterse","We describe the financing and use of long-term care in the Netherlands. Public long-term care insurance is universal and comprehensive; user fees are low compared to other countries. We use linked survey and administrative data to document the distribution of the need for long-term care in the 65+ population, long-term care costs and how they are paid for. The findings reveal that no other country spends more per capita on publicly financed formal care than The Netherlands. A potential reason is that the threshold to receive formal care appears to be lower in the Netherlands than in other countries. Still, a considerable share of the adult population provides informal care. Caregiving is concentrated in specific demographic groups. The costs of informal care provision are considerable, but as a share of total spending on long term care they are smaller than in most developed countries. Adding the costs of informal care to formal care expenditures changes the view on who bears the costs of long-term care.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31823,31823,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
Universalizing the Access to Long-term Care: Evidence from Spain,"Joan Costa-Font, Sergi Jimenez-Martin, Cristina Vilaplana-Prieto, Analía Viola","Spain together with Scotland are two countries that exhibit the largest expansions in long term care (LTC) in the last two decades, universalizing subsidies and supports. This paper is part of a global effort to provide a snapshot of the trends in LTC use and access, as well as the financing, and organization of the LTC system compared to other higher-income countries. The passage of Act 39/2006 on the Promotion of Personal Autonomy and Care for Dependent Persons (SAAD in Spanish) on December 14th, 2006, universalized coverage for care subsidies and supports, allowing access to care conditioned only on individuals’ assessment of care needs. As a consequence, LTC spending as a percentage of GDP has risen from 0.5% in 2003 to nearly 0.9% in 2019, despite private LTC insurance playing a minor role. Still today, LTC remains heavily reliant on informal care, which is now partially subsidized by a caregiving subsidy as part of SAAD. Long-term care spending in Spain amounts to between 1.27% (conservative estimates) and 1.70% (flexible estimation) of GDP. Finally, the system reveals significant gender imbalances in the provision of care, with women accounting for most caregivers in both formal (87%) and informal (58%) care.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31825,31825,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023

Partisan Traps,"Ethan Bueno de Mesquita, Wioletta Dziuda","Electoral incentives may lead policymakers to eschew opportunities for common-interest reform, focusing instead on zero-sum, partisan policymaking. By forgoing opportunities for common-interest reforms, incumbents may convince their constituents that such reforms are rarely feasible, so that policymaking is primarily about zero-sum, partisan conflict. Voters with such beliefs vote based on ideological alignment, rather than factors such as quality or honesty. This is electorally beneficial for incumbents, who are typically ideologically aligned with their constituents. We capture this logic in an infinite horizon model and characterize the resulting dynamics of politics and policymaking. Equilibrium exhibits partisan traps---voters are pessimistic about common-interest opportunities, politicians behave in a purely partisan manner that shuts down voter learning, and ideologically aligned incumbents are consistently reelected. Partisan traps often occur in equilibrium even when common-interest reforms are in fact frequently feasible. The model shows how elite and mass polarization are intertwined, with politicians engaging in strategically polarized and polarizing behavior which leads to pessimistic beliefs among voters, who come to perceive there to be little political common ground.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31827,31827,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
Foreign Competition and Innovation,Elhanan Helpman,"Empirical studies have found that enhanced foreign competition can encourage or discourage innovation. To address this relationship, I examine a market structure in which a small number of large multi-product oligopolists compete with a large number of small single-product firms in the same industry. The single-product firms are short-lived while the multi-product firms live forever, and the large firms invest in innovation in order to enlarge their product spans. All firms export. I show that an increase in the competitiveness of foreign firms can increase or reduce innovation efforts of a large multi-product firm. Moreover, changes in the incentives to innovate can be different for more-productive and less-productive oligopolists. As a result, aggregate sectoral innovation may rise or decline, depending on the productivity distribution of the oligopolists. I also show that changes in short-term operating profits may not be aligned with changes in the incentives to invest in innovation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31840,31840,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023

To Go Electric or To Burn Coal? A Randomized Field Experiment of Informational Nudges,"Hanming Fang, King King Li, Peiyao Shen","Coal heating in residential homes is an important source of indoor air pollution, leading to detrimental health effects. We conduct a randomized field experiment in northern China using three types of SMS campaigns targeting three potential biases that may hinder the adoption of electric heating: a Cost SMS campaign, designed to address the overestimation of electricity expenses; a Health SMS campaign, aimed at addressing the underestimation of health damage associated with coal heating; and a Social Comparison SMS campaign, intended to inform households about the popularity of electric heating. We find that the Cost SMS backfires: it instead leads to a substantial reduction in electric heating, which can be attributed to salience bias induced by the Cost SMS, which drew heightened attention to the cost of electricity. The Health SMS is ineffective for households that underestimate the health damage of coal heating and even backfires for those who expressed little concern about the health consequences. Social Comparison SMS is only effective for a small proportion of households who were concerned about their neighbors' heating choices. Overall, our findings suggest that SMS campaigns targeting these biases are largely ineffective, and caution should be exercised when applying plausible nudge interventions. The findings also suggest that households may be motivated to maintain their beliefs and resist paternalistic interventions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31841,31841,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
Preemptive Austerity with Rollover Risk,"Juan Carlos Conesa, Timothy J. Kehoe","By preemptive austerity, we mean a policy that increases taxes to deter potential rollover crises. The policy is so successful that the usual danger signal of a rollover crisis, a high yield on new bonds sold, does not show up because the policy eliminates the danger. Mechanically, high taxes make the safe zone in the model — the set of sovereign debt levels for which the government prefers to repay its debt rather than default — larger. By announcing a high tax rate at the beginning of the period, the government ensures that tax revenue will be high enough to service sovereign debt becoming due, which deters panics by international lenders but is ex-post suboptimal. That is why, as it engages in preemptive austerity, the government continues to reduce the level of debt to a point where, asymptotically, high taxes are no longer necessary.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31828,31828,23-Nov,NBER,11/6/2023
On the estimation of distributional household wealth: addressing under-reporting via optimization problems with invariant Gini coefficient,"Janina Engel, Dennis Ohlwerter, Matthias Scherer","The Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) provides valuable information for the monetary policy and financial stability purposes. The dataset shows, however, inconsistencies with National Account (NtlA) statistics, as the aggregated HFCS micro data do usually not match the corresponding NtlA macro data. Therefore, we suggest a solution to close the gap via an optimization problem that aims at preserving for each wealth instrument the level of inequality measured by the Gini coefficient. In addition, a lower and an upper bound of inequality are derived, that can be reached by extreme allocations of the wealth discrepancies across the households. Finally, based on the German HFCS, we compare the findings with another approach suggested in the literature that uses a “multivariate calibration”. The comparison indicates that the multivariate calibration may reallocate households’ wealth beyond the observed discrepancies, thereby leading to Gini coefficients that exceed the analytically derived upper bound of inequality.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2865~2c76fbb179.en.pdf?781d771f6fc810cb59b54f01f9870889,2865,6-Nov-23,ECB,11/6/2023

A deep dive into the capital channel of risk sharing in the euro area,"Natalia Martín Fuentes, Alexandra Born, Franziska Bremus, Wieger Kastelein, Claudia Lambert","This paper investigates the contribution of capital markets to international risk sharing in the euro area over the 2000Q1-2021Q1 period. It provides three main contributions: First, the estimation of country-specific vector autoregressions (VAR) shows that shock absorption through capital markets remains modest, particularly in the southern euro area. Second, we analyse the geographical patterns of the capital channel. While risk sharing between southern and northern euro area countries led the improvements in income smoothing at the beginning of the 2000s, intra-regional capital flows supported income smoothing in the recent past. Third, based on a panel threshold VAR, we analyse how the composition of external capital positions impacts the capital channel. Long-term portfolio debt assets and liabilities as well as equity liabilities significantly improved income smoothing. The effect is more pronounced for northern countries, in line with their larger cross-border portfolios, when compared to the southern countries. Regarding foreign direct investment, only northern countries benefited from inward positions.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2864~bc6d7b989f.en.pdf?d0fd1a1e0e6260469b2e484b020ffa02,2864,6-Nov-23,ECB,11/6/2023

Hawkish or Dovish Fed? Estimating a Time-Varying Reaction Function of the Federal Open Market Committee's Median Participant,Manuel González-Astudillo and Rakeen Tanvir,"This paper estimates a time-varying reaction function of the median participant of the Federal Open Market Committee, using a Taylor rule with time-varying coefficients estimated on one- to three-year ahead median forecasts of the federal funds rate, inflation, and the unemployment rate from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). We estimate the model with Bayesian methods, incorporating the effective lower bound on the median federal funds rate projections. The results indicate that the monetary policy rule has become significantly more persistent after the pandemic than in the years prior, and it currently reacts strongly to inflation, at more than twice the responsiveness estimated prior to 2020. Our proposed policy rule produces accurate predictions of the median federal funds rate projections in real time for given SEP forecasts of inflation and the unemployment rate, suggesting that the median participant's reaction function is well-represented by our assumed Taylor rule with time-varying coefficients. Our results show that the median participant's reaction function becomes less persistent and less responsive to inflation yet more responsive to the output gap in anticipation of tighter monetary policy conditions, measured by a steeper yield curve. We also find that labor market activity, inflation, and macroeconomic uncertainty correlate significantly with the evolution of the time-varying coefficients of the rule. Finally, we show that in times of a less persistent policy rule or more responsiveness to inflation, markets perceive nominal bonds as better macroeconomic hedges.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/hawkish-or-dovish-fed-estimating-a-time-varying-reaction-function-of-the-federal-open-market-committees-median-participant.htm,2023-070,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/7/2023
"Late Payment Fees and Nonpayment in Rental Markets, and Implications for Inflation Measurement: Theoretical Considerations and Evidence","Wesley Janson, Randal J. Verbrugge","Accurate rent measurement is essential for constructing a consumer price index (CPI) and for measuring household welfare. Late payment fees and nonpayment of rent are common components of rental expenditures and thus belong in CPIs. Late payment fees are often excluded; we offer a novel critique. In the US CPI, nonpayment is ostensibly included, but, we show, severely undermeasured. Moreover, the manner of its inclusion renders the CPI extremely sensitive to nonpayment variations; we show how to fix this. Nonpayment undermeasurement suggests at least a +1 ppt overestimate in 2020 CPI shelter inflation. Timely nonpayment and late fee measurement is challenging; we offer a practical solution.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2022r2-late-payment-fees-and-nonpayment-in-rental-markets,20-22R2,11.06.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/7/2023
The effects of labor income risk heterogeneity on the marginal propensity to consume,Ettore Savoia,"Using detailed micro-data, this paper documents that households with lower income risk (and higher income levels) exhibit a higher Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) in response to transitory income shocks, all else being equal. This finding is particularly significant among unconstrained households and supported by models with precautionary saving only if designed to account for the empirically observed negative correlation between income levels and income risk. This interaction generates saving dynamics such that the stationary distribution of wealth among households facing different risk levels is not polarized.Therefore, it is possible to compare their respective MPCs within wealth and identify the reduction in MPC due to labor income risk. Otherwise, the effects of income risk are masked by wealth effects. In neither case, the MPC depends on (permanent, persistent, or current) income levels, whose direct effect on the MPC is always ambiguous. Finally, simulations of targeted fiscal rebates for specific labor categories reveal that governments cannot simultaneously stimulate aggregate demand and mitigate income risk.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2866~a11841e627.en.pdf?e27e8b262c477eb3434f0bd4764d3f29,2866,7-Nov-23,ECB,11/7/2023
Disincentive Effects of Unemployment Insurance Benefits,"Andreas Hornstein, Marios Karabarbounis, André Kurmann, Etienne Lalé and Lien Ta","Unemployment insurance (UI) acts both as a disincentive for labor supply and as a demand stimulus which may explain why empirical studies often find limited effects of UI on employment. This paper provides independent estimates of the disincentive effects arising from the largest expansion of UI in U.S. history, the pandemic unemployment benefits. Using high-frequency data on small restaurants and retailers from Homebase, we control for local demand effects by comparing neighboring businesses that largely share the positive impact of UI stimulus. We find that employment in low-wage businesses recovered more slowly than employment in high-wage businesses in labor markets with larger differences in the relative generosity of pandemic UI benefits. According to a labor search model that replicates the estimated employment differences between low- and high-wage businesses, the disincentive effects from the pandemic UI programs held back the aggregate employment recovery by 4.7 percentage points between April and December 2020.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-11,23-11,3-Nov-23,FED-RICHMOND,11/7/2023

Global and local drivers of Bitcoin trading vis-à-vis fiat currencies,"Paola Di Casola, Maurizio Michael Habib, David Tercero-Lucas","We analyse the drivers of Bitcoin transactions against 44 fiat currencies in the largest peer-to-peer crypto exchanges. Momentum and volatility in the cryptoasset market, as well as volatility and liquidity in global financial markets do matter for Bitcoin trading. There is suggestive evidence of a global crypto cycle driven by speculative motives. However, in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs), Bitcoin seems to offer also transactional benefits, since trading increases when the value of the domestic currency is unstable. Proxies of banking depth and digitalisation are negatively correlated with the currency loadings on the global factor, indicating that crypto-assets may offer a speculative alternative to traditional finance when this is not available, especially in EMDEs where the share of younger risk-prone population is higher. Our results clearly point to potential financial stability risks from cryptoisation in EMDEs with low levels of financial development and unstable fiat currencies.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2868~0c2ad2e6e7.en.pdf?d6c30bb110bfb610a1f23569a7bc920c,2868,8-Nov-23,ECB,11/8/2023

The bright side of the doom loop: banks’ sovereign exposure and default incentives,"Luis E. Rojas, Dominik Thaler","The feedback loop between sovereign and financial sector insolvency has been identified as a key driver of the European debt crisis and has motivated an array of policy proposals. We revisit this “doom loop” focusing on governments’ incentives to default. To this end, we present a simple 3-period model with strategic sovereign default, where debt is held by domestic banks and foreign investors. The government maximizes domestic welfare, and thus the temptation to default increases with externally-held debt. Importantly, the costs of default arise endogenously from the damage that default causes to domestic banks’ balance sheets. Domestically-held debt thus serves as a commitment device for the government. We show that two prominent policy prescriptions – lower exposure of banks to domestic sovereign debt or a commitment not to bailout banks – can backfire, since default incentives depend not only on the quantity of debt, but also on who holds it. Conversely, allowing banks to buy additional sovereign debt in times of sovereign distress can avert the doom loop. In an extension we show that in the context of a monetary union (such as the euro area) similar unintended negative consequences may arise from the pooling of debt (such as European safe bond aka. ESBies). A backstop by the central bank (such as the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument) can successfully disable the loop if precisely calibrated.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2869~83394dbfea.en.pdf?6007176d2b9d32db6f784d4e28156d26,2869,8-Nov-23,ECB,11/8/2023
Nothing Gold Can Stay: Artisanal Mine Certifications and Conflict Dynamics in the Congo,"Samuel Chang, Hans Christensen","We examine how conflict-free certifications for artisanal mines—used to comply with provision 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act—affect conflict dynamics in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

After certifications, there is no aggregate reduction in conflict intensity in Eastern DRC territories, but conflicts intensify further away from certified mines, consistent with certifications displacing, not reducing, conflicts.

Congestion in Onboarding Workers and Sticky R&D,Justin Bloesch and Jacob P. Weber,"R&D investment spending exhibits a delayed and hump-shaped response to shocks. We show in a simple partial equilibrium model that rapidly adjusting R&D investment is costly if the probability of converting new hires into productive R&D workers (“onboarding”) is decreasing in the number of new hires (“congestion”). Congestion thus causes R&D-producing firms to slowly hire new workers in response to good shocks and hoard workers in response to bad shocks, providing a microfoundation for convex adjustment costs in R&D investment. Using novel, high-frequency productivity data on individual software developers collected from GitHub, a popular online collaboration platform, we provide quantitative evidence for such congestion. Calibrated to this evidence, a sticky-wage new Keynesian model with heterogeneous investment-producing firms subject to congestion in onboarding and no other frictions yields hump-shaped responses of R&D investment to shocks.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1075.html,1075,23-Nov,FED-NEWYORK,11/8/2023

Monetary/fiscal policy regimes in post-war Europe,"Othman Bouabdallah, Pascal Jacquinot, Valeria Patella","In most euro area countries, the monetary/fiscal policy mix is responsible for the changing history of debt and inflation facts. Using a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model with Markov-switching policy rules, we identify three distinct monetary/fiscal regimes in France and Italy: a Passive Monetary-Active Fiscal regime (PM/AF) before the late 80s/early 90s; an Active Monetary-Passive Fiscal regime (AM/PF) with central bank independence and EMU convergence; a third regime with policy rates at the effective lower bound combined with fiscal active behavior to sustain the recovery. Our simulations reveal that the PM/AF regime in France led to price volatility and debt stabilisation, while the AM/PF regime resulted in disinflation and rising debt trajectory. Meanwhile, Italy’s procyclical fiscal policy in downturns contributed to persisting imbalances, high aggregate volatility, and low growth.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2871~2f10ce452d.en.pdf?2bc9de5bd8206b8e3f93a64e2576877d,2871,9-Nov-23,ECB,11/9/2023

Financial stability considerations in the conduct of monetary policy,"Paul Bochmann, Daniel Dieckelmann, Stephan Fahr, Josef Ruzicka","We empirically analyze the interaction of monetary policy with financial stability and the real economy in the euro area. For this, we apply a quantile vector autoregressive model and two alternative estimation approaches: simulation and local projections. Our specifications include monetary policy surprises, real GDP, inflation, financial vulnerabilities and systemic financial stress. We disentangle conventional and unconventional monetary policy by separating interest rate surprises into two factors that move the yield curve either at the short end or at the long end. Our results show that a build-up of financial vulnerabilities tends to be accompanied initially by subdued financial stress which resurges, however, over a medium-term horizon, harming economic growth. Tighter conventional monetary policy reduces inflationary pressures but increases the risk of financial stress.

Can Everyone Tap into the Housing Piggy Bank? Racial Disparities in Access to Home Equity,"James Conklin, Kristopher Gerardi, Lauren Lambie-Hanson","An earlier version of this paper was posted as Atlanta Fed Working Paper 2022-17. During the 2018–2021 period, Black homeowners’ mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) product applications were rejected at almost double the rate of White homeowners (44% versus 23%), while Hispanic and Asian homeowners also experienced significantly higher denial rates (32% and 30%, respectively). These racial disparities in denials are much larger than those associated with purchase and rate/term refinance mortgage applications. Controlling for loan and borrower characteristics commonly used in the underwriting process significantly reduces the MEW disparities, with the Black-White denial rate gap falling by approximately 83%, and the Hispanic-White gap falling by 73%. Credit scores and debt-to-income ratios are the most important factors explaining the racial gaps, while differences in loan-to-value ratios contribute only modestly. Large disparities remain after controlling for underwriting factors, and these “residual” disparities vary significantly across lenders. While there are numerous potential drivers of the residual disparities, the paper shows that they tend to be larger in geographic areas characterized by more racial animus, which suggests that discriminatory forces may play a role.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-finance/consumer-credit/can-everyone-tap-into-the-housing-piggy-bank-racial-disparities-in-access-to-home-equity,23-25,24-Oct-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,11/9/2023
Nothing Gold Can Stay: Artisanal Mine Certifications and Conflict Dynamics in the Congo,"Samuel Chang, Hans Christensen","We examine how conflict-free certifications for artisanal mines—used to comply with provision 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act—affect conflict dynamics in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Certifications are associated with a 9.4% (16.3%) reduction in armed group–initiated conflicts (fatalities) within a 10-kilometer radius of gold mines. After certifications, there is no aggregate reduction in conflict intensity in Eastern DRC territories, but conflicts intensify further away from certified mines, consistent with certifications displacing, not reducing, conflicts. These findings caution that, rather than being relied on as an exclusive solution, certification programs must be part of a concerted effort toward resolving complex geopolitical challenges, such as the humanitarian crisis in the DRC.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/nothing-gold-can-stay-artisanal-mine-certifications-and-conflict-dynamics-in-the-congo/,2023-144-1,8-Nov-23,BFI,11/9/2023

Did Fintech Loans Default More During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Were Fintech Firms “Cream-Skimming” the Best Borrowers?,"Julapa Jagtiani, Catharine Lemieux, Brandon Goldstein","Studies of fintech lending have shown that their digital access and ability to leverage alternative data have increased accessibility in underserved areas, enabled consumers with thin credit files to obtain credit, and provided a lower cost alternative to long-term credit card financing. This paper exams three questions: (1) Do proprietary loan rating systems accurately predict the likelihood of default? (2) Can a proprietary loan rating system, leveraging alternative data, that was developed in a favorable economic period continue to perform well under adverse economic conditions (such as the COVID-19 pandemic)? (3) Have fintechs been “cream skimming,” i.e., underpricing the cost of credit to top-tier customers? This study uses data from LendingClub, one of the largest fintech lenders in the personal loan market. We find that LendingClub’s loan rating system is superior to traditional measures of credit risk when predicting the likelihood of default and that the loan rating system continued to perform well during the pandemic period.

The Optimal Supply of Central Bank Reserves under Uncertainty,"Gara  Afonso, Gabriele La Spada, Thomas M. Mertens, and John C.

We fully characterize the optimal supply of central bank reserves and associated market equilibrium. We find that the optimal supply of reserves under uncertainty is greater than that absent uncertainty. With a sufficient degree of uncertainty, it is optimal to supply a level of reserves that is abundant (on the flat portion of the demand curve) absent shocks. The optimal mean spread between the market interest rate and administered rates under uncertainty may be higher or lower than that absent uncertainty. Our model is consistent with the observation that the variability of interest rate spreads is a function of the level of reserves.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1077.html,1077,23-Nov,FED-NEWYORK,11/10/2023

"Heterogeneous Districts,  Interests, and Trade Policy","Kishore Gawande, Pablo M. Pinto and Santiago Pinto","Congressional districts are political entities with heterogeneous trade policy preferences due to their diverse economic structures. Representation of these interests in Congress is a crucial aspect of trade policymaking that is missing in canonical political economy models of trade. In this paper, we underscore the influence of districts by developing a political economy model of trade with region-specific factors. Using 2002 data from U.S. Congressional Districts, we first characterize the unobserved district-level demand for protection. Extending the model beyond the small country assumption to account for export interests as a force countering protection, we develop a model of national tariff-setting. The model predictions are used to estimate the welfare weights implied by tariff and non-tariff measures enacted nationally. Our supply-side explanation for trade policy, while complementing Grossman and Helpman (1994), reveals district and industry-level patterns of winners and losers, central to understanding the political consequences of trade and the backlash against globalization.

The Economic Consequences of Social Unrest: Evidence from Initial Public Offerings,"Philip Barrett, Thomas J. Boulton, Terry D. Nixon","Prior research attributes negative stock market performance following episodes of social unrest to elevated uncertainty. However, social unrest does not solely increase uncertainty, but separately acts to decrease investor sentiment. To determine which effect dominates, we study initial public offering (IPO) underpricing, which responds differently to changes to uncertainty and investor sentiment. Consistent with the notion that social unrest dampens investor sentiment, we find robust evidence that IPO first-day returns are lower during times of greater social unrest. Limits to arbitrage intensify the negative relation between social unrest and underpricing. Notably, strong institutional frameworks mitigate the impact of social unrest on underpricing, suggesting that quality institutions weaken the link between investor sentiment and returns.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/10/The-Economic-Consequences-of-Social-Unrest-Evidence-from-Initial-Public-Offerings-541410,WPIEA2023232,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/10/2023
The Pass-through of Wages to Consumer Prices in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Sectoral Data in the U.S.,"Moya Chin, Li Lin","We study the pass-through of labor costs to prices using a novel data-set that links industry-level wages to sectoral consumer prices through input-output tables. Pass-through increased during the COVID-19 pandemic recovery, temporarily in goods and persistently in services. Our analysis suggests that the elevated pass-through contributed at least 0.8 percentage points to goods inflation in 2021 and 0.7 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points to services inflation in 2021 and 2022, respectively. We find that the increase in pass-through reflects elevated demand in goods sectors and firms' difficulty in absorbing high wage growth in services sectors. The analysis suggests it will take a reduction in wage growth to bring PCE inflation back to target.

Quantifying the Revenue Yields from Tax Administration Reforms,"Hassan Adan, Jean-Marc B. Atsebi, Nikolay Gueorguiev, Jiro Honda, Manabu Nose","Despite the criticality of tax administration (TA) reforms in enhancing domestic revenue mobilization, few studies have attempted to quantify the revenue impact of such reforms. This paper fills this gap by estimating the revenue yields associated with various tax administration capabilities, based on the International Survey on Tax Administration (ISORA), the Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT), and TA reform episodes datasets (identified by Akitoby et al., 2020). It uses a Hausman-Taylor cross-country panel regression and an event study for specific TA reform episodes. Our results (using the ISORA data) show that an increase in the overall strength of TA from the 40th percentile to the 60th percentile is associated with an increase in tax revenue by 1.8 pp. of GDP (with a 95 percent confidence range of 0.5‒2.6 pp. of GDP). Similarly, the event-study assessment shows that sustained TA reforms led to an increase in tax revenues between 2 to 3 pp. of GDP, in line with the experience in three country cases (Jamaica, Rwanda, and Senegal). Also, the revenue yields are increasing over time to more than 3 pp. of GDP after the 6th year following a comprehensive reform. The analysis also highlights the significant impact of specific measures including: i) strengthening compliance risks management, ii) enhancing public accountability, iii) establishing Large Taxpayer Offices (LTO), iv) strengthening accountability and transparency, and v) enhancing timely filing of tax declarations.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/10/Quantifying-the-Revenue-Yields-from-Tax-Administration-Reforms-541407,WPIEA2023231,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/10/2023
Trade Diversion Effects from Global Tensions—Higher Than We Think,"Mengqi Wang, Swarnali A Hannan","The paper builds a unique industry-level dataset by combining Mexico’s nationally sourced inputoutput data (INEGI) with cross-country sources (WIOD, UN Comtrade). Using this dataset to exploit higher supply linkages across a larger number of industries than what is available in cross-country sources, the paper estimates the trade diversion effect on Mexico’s exports to the U.S. from two episodes, with a focus on the first: the U.S.-China trade tension in 2018 and the U.S. sanctions on Russia in 2014. Difference-in-differences, local projections and few other empirical methodologies are used. For the first episode, the paper finds higher trade diversion effects than estimates in literature. Output tariff plays an important role, and there is some evidence of a positive impact through downstream tariffs. The effects are stronger when nationally sourced input-output data is used compared to those derived from cross-country sources. Importantly, the magnitude of trade diversion across industries does not depend on Mexico’s industry-level trade exposure to the U.S., but rather on the U.S. tariff changes on Chinese goods, the decrease in imports from China, product substitutability with Chinese products, and (weakly) on Mexico’s GVC integration. Similarly, for the second episode, the paper finds positive trade diversion effects. Overall, the findings suggest that trade diversion effect might be higher than previously thought and the proper accounting of dataset and supply linkages makes a difference.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/10/Trade-Diversion-Effects-from-Global-Tensions-Higher-Than-We-Think-539680,WPIEA2023234,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/10/2023
FINEX - A New Workhorse Model for Macroeconomic Forecasting and Policy Analysis,"Andrew Berg, Yaroslav Hul, Philippe D Karam, Adam Remo, Diego Rodriguez Guzman","This paper presents a semi-structural macroeconomic model aimed at facilitating policy analysis and forecasting, primarily in countries with imperfect capital mobility and hybrid monetary policy regimes. Compared to earlier gap-trend projection models, the Forecasting Model of Internal and External Balance (FINEX) contains three main innovations: it accentuates external and internal balances; explicitly incorporates fiscal policy; and partly endogenizes the main trends. FINEX thus covers a broad set of policy instruments, including foreign exchange interventions (FXI), capital flow management measures (CFM), as well as common fiscal policy instruments. The model incorporates insights from the recent DSGE literature, while maintaining a more accessible gap-trend structure that lends itself to practical policy applications. While the paper refrains from drawing broad policy lessons, it emphasizes the model's ability to interpret recent data in terms of structural shocks and policy responses, thereby aiding policymakers in constructing coherent economic narratives and considering alternative scenarios.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/10/FINEX-A-New-Workhorse-Model-for-Macroeconomic-Forecasting-and-Policy-Analysis-541416,WPIEA2023235,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/10/2023
The Impact of Right-to-Work Laws on Long Hours and Work Schedules,"Osea Giuntella, Rania Gihleb, Jian Qi Tan","Unions play a crucial role in determining wages and employment outcomes. However, union bargaining power may also have important effects on non-pecuniary working conditions. We study the effects of right-to-work laws, which removed agency shop protection and weakened union powers on long hours and non-standard work schedules that may adversely affect workers' health and safety. We exploit variation in the timing of enactment across US states and compare workers in bordering counties across adopting states and states that did not adopt the laws yet. Using the stacked approach to difference-in-differences estimates proposed by Cengiz et al. (2019), we find evidence that right-to-work laws increased the share of workers working long hours by 6%, while there is little evidence of an impact on hourly wages. The effects on long hours are larger in more unionized sectors (i.e. construction, manufacturing, and transportation). While the likelihood of working non-standard hours increases for particular sectors (education and public administration), there is no evidence of a significant increase in the overall sample.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31867,31867,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Long-term Care in Italy,"Agar Brugiavini, Ludovico Carrino, Giacomo Pasini","The provision of long-term care (LTC) for senior citizens in Italy is at the center of the recent policy debate. Italy has witnessed a spectacular increase in the share of people aged 65 and over and in particular of people aged 80 and over, which could translate in large increases in the number of people in need of care. We show that individuals who are in need of LTC have lower economic resources than the average, so that many frail older people have little financial means to pay out-of-pocket for formal care. In fact, publicly provided care is highly fragmented, with stark differences emerging in terms of coverage and generosity across Italian regions. Hence, the supply of LTC is relying heavily on the informal support of members of the family, especially women, at the same time formal care is characterised by a significant underground economy of unskilled carers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31861,31861,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

Longitudinal administrative data from North Carolina show that having a Black same-grade peer significantly improves the achievement and reduces the suspension rates of white teachers’ Black students. Open-ended interviews of North Carolina public school teachers reaffirm these findings. Broadly, our findings suggest that the positive impact of Black teachers’ ability to successfully teach Black students is not limited to their direct interaction with Black students but is augmented by spillover effects on early-career white teachers, likely through peer learning.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31847,31847,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

Using horse race and instrumental variable models, we confirm that the Gold Standard data are relatively free from measurement error but show that the Clarivate data suffer from non-classical measurement error. We employ a variety of methods to adjust the Clarivate data for false negatives and false positives and demonstrate that with these adjustments the data produce estimates very similar to the Gold Standard.

Life and Death at the Margins of Society: The Mortality of the U.S. Homeless Population,"Bruce D. Meyer, Angela Wyse, Ilina Logani","This paper examines the relationship between extreme socioeconomic disadvantage and poor health by providing the first detailed and accurate picture of mortality patterns among people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. Our analyses center on 140,000 people who were sheltered or unsheltered homeless during the 2010 Census, by far the largest sample ever used to study this population and the only sample designed to be nationally representative. These individuals, along with housed comparison groups, are linked to Social Security Administration data on all-cause mortality from 2010-2022 to estimate the magnitude of health disparities associated with homelessness. We find that non-elderly people experiencing homelessness have 3.5 times the mortality risk of those who are housed, accounting for differences in demographic characteristics and geography, and that a 40-year-old homeless person faces a similar mortality risk to a housed person nearly twenty years older. Our results reveal notable patterns in relative mortality risk by age, race, gender, and Hispanic ethnicity and suggest that within the homeless population, employment, higher incomes, and more extensive observed family connections are associated with lower mortality. The mortality hazard of homeless individuals rose by 33 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase that, while similar in proportional terms to the increase for the housed population, affected a much larger share of the homeless population due to their substantially elevated baseline mortality rate. These findings elucidate the persistent hardships associated with homelessness and show that the well-documented gradient between health and poverty persists into the extreme lower tail of socioeconomic disadvantage.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31843,31843,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

We quantify the impact of Japan’s low-rate policies on its government and households. Because of the duration mismatch on the government balance sheet, the government’s fiscal space expands when real rates decline, allowing the government to keep its promises to older Japanese households. A typical younger Japanese household does not have enough duration in its portfolio to continue to finance its spending plan and will be worse off. Low-rate policies tax younger, poorer and less financially sophisticated households.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31850,31850,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
When do Treasuries Earn the Convenience Yield? — A Hedging Perspective,"Viral V. Acharya, Toomas Laarits","We document that the convenience yield of U.S. Treasuries exhibits properties that are consistent with a hedging perspective of safe assets. The convenience yield tends to be low when the covariance of Treasury returns with the aggregate stock market returns is high. A decomposition of the aggregate stock-bond covariance into terms corresponding to the convenience yield, the frictionless risk-free rate, and default risk reveals that the covariance between stock returns and the convenience yield itself drives the effect in a substantive capacity. We show the convenience yield is reduced with heightened inflation expectations that erode the hedging properties of U.S. Treasuries and other fixed-income money-like assets, inducing a switch to alternatives such as gold; it is also reduced immediately prior to debt-ceiling standoffs and with increases in Treasury supply.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31863,31863,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

Differences in How and Why Social Comparison and Real-Time Feedback Impact Resource Use: Evidence from a Field Experiment,"Mark A. Andor, Lorenz Goette, Michael K. Price, Anna Schulze Tilling, Lukas Tomberg","We compare the behavior and welfare effects of two popular interventions for resource conservation. The first intervention is social comparison reports (SC), which primarily provide consumers with information motivating behavioral change. The second intervention is real-time feedback (RTF), which primarily provides consumers with information facilitating behavioral change. In a field experiment with around 1,000 participants, we directly observe the interventions’ effects on participants’ behavior. Further, we elicit participants’ willingness to pay for receiving the interventions, both before and after having experienced them for one month. We find that SC leads to a reduction in water use per shower by 9.4%, RTF by 28.8%, and the combination (BOTH) by 35.0%. Our willingness to pay results show that all interventions are highly valued by participants and that willingness to pay for RTF and BOTH is significantly higher than for SC. Furthermore, we find that the valuation of the interventions do not change following one-month experience. Our results suggest that while both interventions improve welfare, providing consumers with information facilitating behavioral change achieves a higher impact and a slightly higher welfare increase than providing consumers with information motivating behavioral change.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31845,31845,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Job Transitions and Employee Earnings After Acquisitions: Linking Corporate and Worker Outcomes,"David Arnold, Kevin S.

Using firm balance sheet data linked to individual earnings data in Canada and a matched difference-in-differences design, we find that after M&As acquirers expand while targets shrink substantially relative to their matched control groups. Additionally, profit margins decrease for both acquirers and targets in the medium run. Furthermore, workers at target firms suffer losses in earnings, and this decline in earnings is entirely driven by workers who move to other firms after an M&A event. We find that workers leaving target firms after M&As move to larger firms with higher wage premiums, but with much worse match qualities on average. Taken together, it appears that job transitions to employers with poor match qualities primarily explain the post-M&A decline in worker earnings in our setting.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31866,31866,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

Finally, we document expenditures on long-term care and estimate the value of informal care. The cost of long-term care for the elderly (65+), including both cost of nursing home and home health agency, reached 61 billion euro in 2019. Half of these spending are for nursing homes while only about 22.5% of beneficiaries use these institutions. Out-of-pocket spending differs greatly between modes of care. Out-of-pocket expenditures make up only about 7% of total expenditures for home care. In nursing homes, 41% of expenditures are out-of-pocket payment. Most of the expenditures are covered by the long-term care insurance. The share of other governmental schemes in expenditures for inpatient care is relatively high. This is explained by a high rate of benefit recipients who cannot afford co-payments for nursing homes: about one-third of all nursing home residents receive means- and wealth-tested social assistance. If we add the costs of informal care the share of privately financed care amounts to nearly 60% of total expenditures.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31870,31870,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Implications of Asset Market Data for Equilibrium Models of Exchange Rates,"Zhengyang Jiang, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Hanno Lustig","We characterize the relation between exchange rates and their macroeconomic fundamentals without committing to a specific model of preferences, endowment or menu of traded assets. When investors can trade home and foreign currency risk-free bonds,  the exchange rate appreciates in states that are worse for home investors than foreign investors. This prediction is at odds with the empirical evidence and can only be overturned if the deviations from U.I.P. are large and exchange rates are highly predictable. Without bond Euler equation wedges, it is impossible to match the empirical exchange rate cyclicality (the Backus-Smith puzzle) and the deviations from U.I.P. (the Fama puzzle) as well as the lack of predictability (the Meese-Rogoff puzzle). To relax this trade-off, we need Euler equation wedges consistent with a home currency bias, home bond convenience yields or financial repression.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31851,31851,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
"Forecasting the Impact of Racial Uprisings, Market versus Stakeholders' Expectations","Bocar A. Ba, Roman Rivera, Alexander Whitefield","Given police abolitionism’s new visibility after the 2020 racial justice protests, we assess stakeholder beliefs on the protests’ stock impacts on police-affiliated firms. Experts generally underestimate the firms’ stock gains, except situated experts like community organizers and police experts, who link the market responses to reforms, not budget cuts. An experiment with nonexperts and finance professionals shows negatively skewed stock predictions among respondents lacking information on policing products and no effect of exposure to narratives about the protests on forecast alignment. National data show enduring support for police reform despite abolitionist advocacy and little understanding of the Defund movement’s objectives.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31857,31857,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Perspectives on the Labor Share,Loukas Karabarbounis,"As of 2022, the share of U.S. income accruing to labor is at its lowest level since the Great Depression. Updating previous studies with more recent observations, I document the continuing decline of the labor share for the United States, other countries, and various industries. I discuss how changes in technology and product, labor, and capital markets affect the trend of the labor share. I also examine its relationship with other macroeconomic trends, such as rising markups, higher concentration of economic activity, and globalization. I conclude by offering some perspectives on the economic and policy implications of the labor share decline.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31854,31854,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
What Drives Booms and Busts in Value?,"John Y. Campbell, Stefano Giglio, Christopher Polk","Value investing delivers volatile returns, with large drawdowns during both market booms and busts. This paper interprets these returns through an intertemporal CAPM, which predicts that aggregate cash flow, discount rate, and volatility news all move value returns.  We document that indeed these shocks explain a large fraction of quarterly value returns over the last 60 years. We also distinguish between the intra-industry and inter-industry components of value, showing that the ICAPM explains the former better. Finally, we develop a novel methodology to perform this decomposition at the daily frequency, using it to interpret value returns during the Covid-19 pandemic.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31859,31859,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

The Long-Term Distributional Impacts of a Full-Year Interleaving Math Program in Nigeria,"Lotte van der Haar, Guthrie Gray-Lobe, Michael Kremer, Joost de Laat","This study reports the findings from a year-long randomized evaluation assessing the impact of assigning 62 classrooms in Nigeria to receive either blocked or interleaved math problem sets. Blocked practice sessions focused on a single skill at a time. Interleaved problem sets alternated between different skills within a practice session. On tests of short-term retention, interleaved practice increased test scores by 0.29 standard deviations. In contrast, we find no evidence that interleaving improves average performance on a cumulative assessment measuring retention of material over the academic year. We find some evidence of large impacts on the cumulative assessment at the bottom of the distribution, but these impacts appear to be offset by negative impacts at the top.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31853,31853,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Policymakers' Uncertainty,"Anna Cieslak, Stephen Hansen, Michael McMahon, Song Xiao","Uncertainty is a ubiquitous concern emphasized by policymakers. We study how uncertainty affects decision-making by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). We distinguish between the notion of Fed-managed uncertainty vis-a-vis uncertainty that emanates from within the economy and which the Fed takes as given. A simple theoretical framework illustrates how Fed-managed uncertainty introduces a wedge between the standard Taylor-type policy rule and the optimal decision. Using private Fed deliberations, we quantify the types of uncertainty the FOMC perceives and their effects on its policy stance. The FOMC's expressed inflation uncertainty strongly predicts a more hawkish policy stance that is not explained either by the Fed's macroeconomic forecasts or by public uncertainty proxies. We rationalize these results with a model of inflation tail risks and argue that the effect of uncertainty on the FOMC's decisions reflects policymakers' concern with maintaining credibility for the inflation anchor.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31849,31849,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
The Long-run Effect of Air Pollution on Survival,"Tatyana Deryugina, Julian Reif","Many environmental hazards produce health effects that take years to arise, but quasi-experimental studies typically measure outcomes and treatment over short time periods. We develop a new approach to overcome this challenge and use it to gauge the effect of exposure to air pollution on US life expectancy. Using changes in wind direction as an instrument for daily sulfur dioxide levels, we first characterize the short-run mortality effects of acute exposure during the time period 1972-1988. Exposure causes two distinct mortality patterns: a short-run mortality displacement effect, and a persistent accelerated aging effect. We then incorporate our estimates into a flexible health production model to quantify the lifelong effects of chronic air pollution exposure for a cohort born in 1972. Model calculations of the effect of chronic exposure on life expectancy are 7-8 times larger than the effect implied by simple extrapolation of our short-run empirical estimates. Ninety percent of the survival benefits accrue after the first fifty years of life, implying that most of the 1970 Clean Air Act's health benefits have yet to emerge for cohorts born after its passage.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31858,31858,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
The Deposit Business at Large vs. Small Banks,"Adrien d&#039;Avernas, Andrea L. Eisfeldt, Can Huang, Richard Stanton, Nancy Wallace","The deposit business differs at large versus small banks.  We provide a parsimonious model and extensive empirical evidence supporting the idea that much of the variation in deposit-pricing  behavior between large and small banks reflects differences in ""preferences and technologies.""  Large banks offer superior liquidity services but lower deposit rates, and locate where customers value their services.  In addition to receiving a lower level of deposit rates on average, customers of large banks exhibit lower demand elasticities with respect to deposit rate spreads.  As a result, despite the fact that the locations of large-bank branches have demographics typically associated with greater financial sophistication, large-bank customers earn lower average deposit rates.  Our explanation for deposit pricing behavior challenges the idea that deposit pricing is mainly driven by pricing power derived from the large observed degree of concentration in the banking industry.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31865,31865,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023

Analyzing consumer transaction data for millions of U.S. households, we find that, except for high income early adopters, cryptocurrency investors resemble the general population. These investors span all income levels, with most dollars coming from high-income individuals, similar to equity investors. High past crypto returns and personal income shocks lead to increased cryptocurrency investments. Higher household-level inflation expectations also correlate with greater crypto investments, aligning with hedging motives.

Safety Reviews on Airbnb: An Information Tale,"Aron Culotta, Ginger Zhe Jin, Yidan Sun, Liad Wagman","Consumer reviews, especially those expressing concerns of product quality, are crucial for the credibility of online platforms. However, reviews that criticize a product or service may also dissuade buyers from using the platform, creating an incentive to blur the visibility of critical reviews.  Using Airbnb and official crime data in five major US cities, we find that both reviews and self experiences concerning the safety of a listing's vicinity decrease guest bookings on the platform. Counterfactual simulations suggest that a complete removal of vicinity safety reviews (VSR) would hurt guests but increase revenues from reservations on Airbnb, with positive sorting towards listings formerly with VSR. Conversely, incorporating VSR in a listing's overall ratings or highlighting VSR could generate opposite effects. Either way, the interests of consumers are not always aligned with the interests of a revenue-centric platform. Because VSR are more closely correlated with official crime statistics in low-income and minority neighborhoods, our findings suggest that suppressing or highlighting VSR would have different effects on different neighborhoods.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31855,31855,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Technology and Labor Displacement: Evidence from Linking Patents with Worker-Level Data,"Leonid Kogan, Dimitris Papanikolaou, Lawrence D.W. Schmidt, Bryan Seegmiller","We develop measures of labor-saving and labor-augmenting technology exposure using textual analysis of patents and job tasks. Using US administrative data, we show that both measures negatively predict earnings growth of individual incumbent workers. While labor-saving technologies predict earnings declines and higher likelihood of job loss for all workers, labor-augmenting technologies primarily predict losses for older or highly-paid workers. However, we find positive effects of labor-augmenting technologies on occupation-level employment and wage bills. A model featuring labor-saving and labor-augmenting technologies with vintage-specific human capital quantitatively matches these patterns.

Identification using Revealed Preferences in Linearly Separable Models,"Nikhil Agarwal, Pearl Z. Li, Paulo J.

We develop general identification results for a large class of models that have a linearly separable payoff structure. Our model allows for both discrete and continuous choice sets. It incorporates widely studied models such as discrete and hedonic choice models, auctions, school choice mechanisms, oligopoly pricing and trading games. We characterize the identified set and show that point identification can be achieved either if the choice set is sufficiently rich or if a variable that shifts preferences is available. Our identification results also suggests an estimation approach.

Do Water Audits Work?,"Jesper Akesson, Robert W. Hahn, Rajat Kochhar, Robert D. Metcalfe","Water suppliers are showing greater interest in using different mechanisms to promote conservation. One such mechanism is conducting home water audits, which involves assessing water use and providing tailored suggestions for conserving water for residential customers. Yet, very little is known about the economic impacts of these water audits. This paper helps fill this gap by implementing a natural field experiment in the United Kingdom. The experiment involves randomly allocating 45,000 water customers to a control group or to treatment groups that receive different behavioral encouragements to take-up an online water audit. Our analysis yields three main findings. First, encouraging subjects to participate in an audit with financial incentives reduces household consumption by about 17 percent over two months. Furthermore, we find that the size of the financial incentive used to encourage conservation matters for take-up, but not conservation. Second, notwithstanding these improvements in water conservation, the per capita net benefits of the intervention are close to zero under a wide range of assumptions. We also implement a marginal value of public funds approach that considers benefits and costs and we reach a similar conclusion. Third, we find that targeting of high users could double the effectiveness of the financial incentive interventions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31831,31831,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
A Framework for Geoeconomics,"Christopher Clayton, Matteo Maggiori, Jesse Schreger","Governments use their countries’ economic strength from existing financial and trade relationships  to achieve geopolitical and economic goals. We refer to this practice as geoeconomics. We build a framework based on three core ingredients: input output linkages, limited contract enforceability, and externalities. Geoeconomic power arises from the ability to jointly exercise threats arising from separate economic activities.  Being able to retaliate against a deviating country across multiple arenas, often involving indirect threats from third parties also being pressured, increases the off equilibrium threats and, thus, helps in equilibrium to increase enforceability. A world hegemon, like the United States, exerts its power on firms and governments in its economic network by asking these entities to take costly actions that benefit the hegemon. We characterize the optimal actions and show that they take the form of mark-ups on goods or higher rates on lending, but also import restrictions and tariffs. The input-output amplification makes controlling some sectors more valuable for the hegemon since changes in the allocation of these strategic sectors have a larger influence on the world economy. This formalizes the idea of economic coercion as a combination of strategic pressure and costly actions. We apply the framework to two leading examples: national security externalities and the Belt and Road Initiative.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31852,31852,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
Do banks practice what they preach? Brown lending and environmental disclosure in the euro area,"Leonardo Gambacorta, Salvatore Polizzi, Alessio Reghezza, Enzo Scannella","This study examines whether the level of environmental disclosure in banks’ financial reports matches less brown lending portfolios. Using granular credit register data and detailed information on firm-level greenhouse gas emission intensities, we find a negative relationship between environmental disclosure and brown lending. However, this effect is contingent on the tone of the financial report. Banks that express a negative tone, reflecting genuine concern and awareness of environmental risks, tend to lend less to more polluting firms. Conversely, banks that express a positive tone, indicating lower concern and awareness of environmental risks, tend to lend more to polluting firms. These findings highlight the importance of increasing awareness of environmental risks, so that banks perceive them as a critical and urgent pressing threat, leading to a genuine commitment to act as environmentally responsible lenders.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2872~b91ebffb71.en.pdf?b21c1346272b8634718a98691ff7b90f,2872,10-Nov-23,ECB,11/13/2023
Designing Difference in Difference Studies With Staggered Treatment Adoption: Key Concepts and Practical Guidelines,"Seth M. Freedman, Alex Hollingsworth, Kosali I.

A growing methods literature points out potential problems with DID estimators when treatment is staggered in adoption and varies with time. Despite this, no practical guide exists for addressing these new critiques in public health research. We illustrate these new DID concepts with step-by-step examples, code, and a checklist. We draw insights by comparing the simple 2 × 2 DID design (single treatment group, single control group, two time periods) with more complex cases: additional treated groups, additional time periods of treatment, and with treatment effects possibly varying over time. We outline newly uncovered threats to causal interpretation of DID estimates and the solutions the literature has proposed, relying on a decomposition that shows how the more complex DID are an average of simpler 2X2 DID sub-experiments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31842,31842,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
The Active Role of the Natural Rate of Unemployment during Cyclical Recoveries,"Robert E.

We demonstrate that this tendency to treat the natural rate as near-constant would explain the surprisingly low slope of the Phillips curve. We show that the natural rate closely tracked the actual rate during the long recovery that began in 2009 and ended in 2020. We explain how the common finding of research in the Phillips-curve framework of low---often extremely low---response of inflation to unemployment could be the result of fairly close tracking of the natural rate and the actual rate in recoveries. Our interpretation of the data contrasts to that of most Phillips-curve studies, that conclude that inflation has little relation to unemployment. We suggest that the flat Phillips curve is an illusion caused by assuming that the natural rate of unemployment has little or no movement during recoveries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31848,31848,23-Nov,NBER,11/13/2023
The Effects of the Federal Reserve Chair’s Testimony on Interest Rates and Stock Prices,"Matthew V. Gordon, Kurt G.

First, we study testimony associated with the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Reports (MPRs) to Congress. Testimony for a particular MPR is usually given on two days, one day for each chamber of Congress. We separately study the first day and second day of MPR testimony. We also study testimonies not associated with MPRs but that are still related to monetary policy. We find that first-day MPR testimonies cause the largest movements in interest rates and generate negative co-movement between interest rates and stock prices. Testimonies not associated with MPRs have similar but weaker effects. Second-day MPR testimonies cause the smallest movements in interest rates and generate no co-movement between interest rates and stock prices.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2326-federal-reserve-chairs-testimony-effects,23-26,11.13.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/14/2023
Black Mayors and Crime,Craig Sylvera,"Local elections are often contested on the grounds of public safety, but do elected officials have any power to curb crime or poor police behavior? Black mayors have particular interest in the issue because Black communities are routinely victimized by high levels of crime and fragile police-community relations. Using data on elections of first-time Black mayors, I find that police forces add more Black officers, a finding that is especially true for mayors with executive authority. Officers arrest 48 fewer potential Black offenders per 10,000 Black residents for crimes where they have the ability to exercise discretion, a finding commensurate with the overall reduction in crime. This effect is not visible for similar white arrests. Using changes in the levels of arrests and officers induced by pivotal Black elections, I then estimate the correlation of an additional officer on race-specific arrests. An additional Black officer is related to large reductions in discretionary Black arrests, perhaps suggesting increasing the presence and visibility of Black officers may offer a solution to the “over-policing, under-policing” problem Black communities face.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2327-black-mayors-and-crime,23-27,11.14.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/14/2023

(2022) for the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Lifetime earnings are a particularly important measure of well-being, with relevance for wealth accumulation among other economic and social outcomes, but they are under-studied in the context of racial disparities. We describe how the different components of lifetime earnings—including annual earnings of workers, number of working household members, and number of years of employment during the working life—vary by race. We then decompose the differences in lifetime earnings using the recentered influence function and show that human capital-related variables, including educational attainment and years of full-time employment, account for most of the observed differences in lifetime earnings between White, Black, and Hispanic families. We also explore the contribution of business ownership to explained disparities in lifetime earnings and find that it is significant and that business ownership’s explanatory power increases at the top of the lifetime-earnings distribution.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/decomposing-lifetime-earnings-differences-between-white-black-and-hispanic-families,23-14,14-Nov-23,FED-BOSTON,11/14/2023
Demographics and Real Interest Rates Across Countries and Over Time,"Carlos Carvalho, Andrea Ferrero, Felipe Mazin, Fernanda Nechio","We explore the implications of demographic trends for the evolution of real interest rates across countries and over time. To that end, we develop a tractable three-country general equilibrium model with imperfect capital mobility and country-specific demographic trends. We calibrate the model to study how low-frequency movements in a country's real interest rate depend on its own and other countries' demographic factors, given a certain degree of financial integration. The more financially integrated a country is, the higher the sensitivity of its real interest rate to global developments is, and the less its own real rate determinants matter. We then estimate panel error correction models relating real interest rates to many of its possible determinants-demographics included-imposing some restrictions motivated by lessons from our structure model. Results corroborate the importance of accounting for time-varying financial integration, and show global factors and life expectancy are relevant determinants of real interest rates.",https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/working-papers/2023/32/,2023-32,10/1/2023,FED-SANFRANCISCO,11/15/2023

Partisan Traps,"Ethan Bueno de Mesquita, Wioletta Dziuda","The desire to stifle political competition may lead elected officials to eschew common-interest reforms and focus instead on zero-sum partisan conflict. By forgoing opportunities for common-interest reforms, incumbents may convince their constituents that such reforms are rarely feasible, so that policymaking is primarily about choosing partisan sides. Voters with such beliefs vote based on ideological alignment, rather than factors such as competence or honesty. This is electorally beneficial for incumbents, who are typically ideologically aligned with their constituents. We capture this logic in an infinite horizon model and characterize the resulting dynamics of politics and policymaking. Equilibrium exhibits partisan traps-voters are pessimistic about common-interest opportunities, and hence elect ideologically aligned incumbents, and incumbents respond by behaving in a purely partisan manner that shuts down voter learning. Partisan traps often occur in equilibrium even when common-interest reforms are in fact frequently feasible. The model shows how elite and mass polarization are intertwined, with politicians engaging in strategically polarized and polarizing behavior which leads to pessimistic beliefs among voters, who then vote in partisan fashion.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/partisan-traps/,2023-145,10-Nov-23,BFI,11/15/2023

Loss sharing in central clearinghouses: winners and losers,"Christian Kubitza, Loriana Pelizzon, Mila Getmansky Sherman","Central clearing counterparties (CCPs) were established to mitigate default losses resulting from counterparty risk in derivatives markets. In a parsimonious model, we show that clearing benefits are distributed unevenly across market participants. Loss sharing rules determine who wins or loses from clearing. Current rules disproportionately benefit market participants with flat portfolios. Instead, those with directional portfolios are relatively worse off, consistent with their reluctance to voluntarily use central clearing. Alternative loss sharing rules can address cross-sectional disparities in clearing benefits.

Fund fragility: the role of investor base,"Nolwenn Allaire, Johannes Breckenfelder, Marie Hoerova","Using security-by-security data on investor holdings in the euro area, we study run dynamics across different fund-shares of the same fund during the unprecedented liquidity crisis in March 2020. For an average bond or equity mutual fund-share, households, other euro area funds, and the foreign sector each represent about a quarter of the total holdings. Insurance companies hold another 14%, with all other investors combined (banks, non-financial corporations, pension funds, etc.) accounting for less than 10% of holdings. Analyzing bond funds, we show that fund-shares with higher ownership by other funds suffered substantially higher outflows (by 6 percentage points), while fund-shares with higher ownership by households had substantially lower outflows (by 5 percentage points) compared to the other fund-shares within the same fund. This gap is not driven by time-varying differences in fund performance. Results for equity funds are similar, although they faced substantially smaller outflows, coupled with much larger declines in performance, compared to bond funds. Our findings suggest that a collective “dash for cash” by consumers and firms in need of liquidity at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic was not the source of mutual fund fragility. Instead, the most run-prone investor type turned out to be the fund sector itself.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2874~af5c7c3678.en.pdf?dd12bcb5085c976c78c68a4f6ebc08b9,2874,14-Nov-23,ECB,11/15/2023
Time Use and the Efficiency of Heterogeneous Markups,"Brian C. Albrecht, Tom Phelan, Nick Pretnar","What are the welfare implications of markup heterogeneity across firms? In standard monopolistic competition models, such heterogeneity implies inefficiency even in the presence of free entry. We enrich the standard model with heterogeneous firms so that preferences are non-separable in off-market time and market consumption and show that this changes the welfare implications of markup heterogeneity. In this context, homogeneity of markups is neither necessary nor sufficient for efficiency. The marginal cost of the marginal firm is weakly inefficiently high when off-market time and market consumption are complements and inefficiently low when they are substitutes, and the equilibrium allocation devotes weakly too few resources to firm creation. However, when off-market time and market consumption are perfect complements, markups are heterogeneous across firms and yet the equilibrium allocation is efficient.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2328-time-use-and-efficiency-of-heterogeneous-markups,23-28,11.16.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/16/2023
What drives core inflation? The role of supply shocks,"Marta Bańbura, Elena Bobeica, Catalina Martínez Hernández","We propose a framework to identify a rich set of structural drivers of inflation in order to understand the role of the multiple and concomitant sources of the post-pandemic inflation surge. We specify a medium-sized structural Bayesian VAR on a comprehensive set of variables for the euro area economy. We analyse in particular various types of supply shocks, some of which were not considered relevant before the pandemic, notably global supply chain shocks and gas price shocks. The residuals of the VAR are assumed to admit a factor structure and the shocks are identified via zero and sign restrictions on factor loadings. The framework can deal with ragged-edge data and extreme observations. Shocks linked to global supply chains and to gas prices have exhibited a much larger influence than in the past. Overall, supply shocks can explain the bulk of the post-pandemic inflation surge, also for core inflation. Being able to gauge the impact of such shocks is useful for policy making. We show that a counterfactual core inflation measure net of energy and global supply chain shocks has been more stable after the pandemic.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2875~e585ae652b.en.pdf?f85a8b326ab051060796d6b29cd8a9d1,2875,16-Nov-23,ECB,11/16/2023
Does the World Free Ride on US Pledges to Reduce Greenhouse Gas  Emissions? Evidence from the Paris Climate Agreement,"Trevor Houser, Kate Larsen, Michael Greenstone","The US is widely believed to play a pivotal role in the development of international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but do other countries free ride on US pledges? This paper provides what we believe is the first empirical evidence by proposing the US Climate Reciprocity Ratio (CRR); this summary statistic is the ratio of the rest of the world’s pledged reductions to the US’ pledged reductions through international climate negotiations. The analysis begins by quantifying countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Net Zero targets under the Paris Agreement by taking the difference between their pledges and leading “business as usual” projections of their emissions at the time of their pledges (e.g., from the International Energy Administration). Using these pledged reductions, there are two main findings: 1) pledged emissions reductions under the Paris Agreement, if successfully achieved, would reduce global net GHG emissions by 12% – 24% in 2030 and by 38% – 54% in 2050; and 2) the estimated CRR ranges from 2.5 to 10.8, with the upper end of the range applying to the middle of the century when the US’ share of global emissions has declined. Although pledges are not the same as reductions, these findings suggest that US climate policy can have indirect benefits by unlocking pledged reductions in other countries that benefit the US.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/does-the-world-free-ride-on-us-pledges-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-evidence-from-the-paris-climate-agreement/,2023-146-1,15-Nov-23,BFI,11/16/2023
Defusing leverage: liquidity management and labor contracts,Edoardo Maria Acabbi and Andrea Alati,"This study employs Italian administrative data to investigate how the use of permanent and fixed-term labor contracts influences the transmission of aggregate shocks to firms’ fundamentals. We explore how firms strategically manage their labor-induced operating leverage by adjusting the composition of contracts in their workforce. Our findings reveal two key insights. First, a higher labor share is associated with increased volatility in cash flows following unexpected real shocks, indicating the presence of operating leverage through labor costs. Second, firms with a greater proportion of temporary contracts exhibit lower variability in cash flows and profits. This smoothing effect is more pronounced in firms with a higher labor share attributed to the permanent workforce. We complement our analysis by examining the 2001 labor market reform that lifted restrictions on the creation of temporary contracts. Our results demonstrate that firms, following the staggered implementation of the reform, increased their utilization of temporary contracts while reducing average labor compensation. Furthermore, we find that, only among firms with an ex-ante more rigid labor cost structure and in more concentrated labor markets, the earlier transition to a more flexible workforce composition led to a sizable increase in profit margins and a decrease in the cross-sectional standard deviation of profits.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2023/defusing-leverage-liquidity-management-and-labor-contracts,1051,"Fri, 17 Nov 2",BOE,11/17/2023
A Financial New Keynesian Model,"Thomas M. Mertens, Tony Zhang","This paper solves a standard New Keynesian model in terms of risk-neutral expectations and estimates it using a cross-section of longer-dated financial assets at a single point in time. Inflation risk premia appear in the theory and cause inflation to deviate from its target on average. We re-estimate the model based on each day’s closing prices to capture high-frequency changes in the expected path of the economy. Our estimates show that financial markets reacted to the post-COVID surge in inflation with higher short-run inflation expectations, an increase in the inflation risk premium, and an increase in the long-run neutral real rate, 𝑟∗, while long-term inflation expectations remained well anchored.

Hidden exposure: measuring US supply chain reliance,"Richard Baldwin, Rebecca Freeman and Angelos Theodorakopoulos","Supply chain problems, previously relegated to specialized journals, now appear in G7 Leaders’ Communiqués. Our paper looks at three core elements of the problems: measurement of the links that expose supply chains to disruptions, the nature of the shocks that cause the disruptions, and the criteria for policy to mitigate the impact of disruptions. Utilizing global input-output data, we show that US exposure to foreign suppliers, and particularly to China, is ‘hidden’ in the sense that it is much larger than what conventional trade data suggest. However, at the macro level, exposure remains relatively modest, given that over 80% of US industrial inputs are sourced domestically. We argue that many recent shocks to supply chains have been systemic rather than idiosyncratic. Moreover, systemic shocks are likely to arise from climate change, geoeconomic tensions, and digital disruptions. Our principal conclusion is that concerns regarding supply chain disruptions, and policies to address them, should focus on individual products, rather than the whole manufacturing sector.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2023/hidden-exposure-measuring-us-supply-chain-reliance,1052,"Fri, 17 Nov 2",BOE,11/17/2023
US monetary policy spillovers to European banks,Alexander Jung,"The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy announcements have created massive spillovers to global financial markets. Based on daily data for the sample from 1999 to 2019, this study finds that the Fed’s monetary policy announcements created significant international spillovers to bond yields and stock prices of European banks and non-financial corporations (NFCs), while changes in uncertainty around the expected Fed policy path and Fed information effects constituted critical additional dimensions of these spillover effects. International spillovers to bond yields of banks and NFCs were similar, while stock prices of European banks responded somewhat stronger than those of NFCs. The significant spillovers from the Fed’s forward guidance to European bond yields show that central bank communication is very relevant for international transmission. In relation to earlier studies emphasizing strong QE-related spillovers, this study suggests that Fed QE announcements created only small spillovers on bond yields and stock prices of European banks and NFCs.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2876~4bfa61fd60.en.pdf?fe4c9fc95710a2da9b411516d7739712,2876,17-Nov-23,ECB,11/17/2023

The Optimal Supply of Central Bank Reserves under Uncertainty,"Gara Afonso, Gabriele La Spada, Thomas M. Mertens, John C.

We fully characterize the optimal supply of central bank reserves and associated market equilibrium. We find that the optimal supply of reserves under uncertainty is greater than that absent uncertainty. With a sufficient degree of uncertainty, it is optimal to supply a level of reserves that is abundant (on the flat portion of the demand curve) absent shocks. The optimal mean spread between the market interest rate and administered rates under uncertainty may be higher or lower than that absent uncertainty. Our model is consistent with the observation that the variability of interest rate spreads is a function of the level of reserves.",https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/working-papers/2023/34/,2023-34,11/1/2023,FED-SANFRANCISCO,11/17/2023

"Mobile Money, Perception about Cash, and Financial Inclusion: Learning from Uganda’s Micro-Level Data","Felix F. Simione, Tara S Muehlschlegel","Will mobile money render cash less dominant over time in Africa? Can it promote financial inclusion? We shed light on these questions by exploring individual-level and nationally representative survey data for Uganda, a country in a region that pioneered mobile money in the world. We use the Propensity Score Matching method to robustly compare mobile money users and non-users across a range of indicators that capture individuals’ perceptions about cash, and the extent to which they remit, save, and borrow money. We present the first evidence that mobile money users, compared to non-users, are more likely to perceive cash as risky and less likely to prefer carrying large amounts of cash.

Central Bank Digital Currency and Bank Disintermediation in a Portfolio Choice Model,"Huifeng Chang, Federico Grinberg, Lucyna Gornicka, Marcello Miccoli, Brandon  Tan","Would the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) lead to lower deposits (disintermediation) and lending in the banking sector? This paper develops a model where households heterogeneous in wealth allocate between an illiquid asset and assets that can be used for payments: bank deposits, cash, and CBDC. CBDC is more efficient as a means of payment and has lower access cost than deposits. Deposits are offered by an imperfectly competitive banking sector which raises deposit interest rates after CBDC introduction to prevent substitution away from deposits to CBDC. We find that there are two opposing margins of impact on the level of aggregate deposits: (1) the intensive margin gain in deposits by richer households increasing their holdings of deposits because of higher interest rates, and (2) the extensive margin loss of deposits among poorer households who switch from deposits to the CBDC. The extensive margin gain in deposits is more likely to dominate (yielding a fall in total deposits) when the mass of poorer households is large and when it is relatively costly to access bank accounts. This tends to be the case in developing and emerging market economies. However, even when the extensive margin loss of deposits dominates and there is disintermediation, the impact on lending is quantitatively small if banks have access to other forms of funding, such as wholesale or central bank financing.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/18/Central-Bank-Digital-Currency-and-Bank-Disintermediation-in-a-Portfolio-Choice-Model-541607,WPIEA2023236,"Fri, 17 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/18/2023
Is FinTech Eating the Bank's Lunch?,"Sami Ben Naceur, Bertrand Candelon, Selim A Elekdag, Drilona Emrullahu","This paper examines how the growing presence of FinTech firms affects the performance of traditional financial institutions. The findings point to a negative impact on profitability, primarily due to a reduction in interest income and a rise in operational costs. Although established financial institutions have tried to diversify their revenue streams, these efforts have proven inadequate to offset the losses associated with increased competition from FinTech firms. Our study also reveals that various FinTech business models, such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending and Balance Sheet lending, have varying effects on financial institutions. Cooperative banks experience more significant profit deterioration under both models, whereas (larger) commercial banks appear to benefit from partnerships with P2P platforms, as evidenced by an increase in non-interest income. Furthermore, the findings suggest that FinTech presence has a disproportionately larger adverse effect on banks in countries with more competitive, profitable, and developed financial systems. Interestingly, however, traditional financial institutions in countries with stronger regulatory frameworks appear to benefit from the expanding influence of FinTech firms.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/18/Is-FinTech-Eating-the-Bank-s-Lunch-540817,WPIEA2023239,"Fri, 17 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/18/2023

Ten Facts about Son Preference in India,Seema Jayachandran,"This article discusses son preference in India, including both greater investment in sons and the fertility preference for sons. Regarding differential investment, I focus on child health and show that gender gaps in inputs and outcomes have narrowed in recent years. Nonetheless, girls remain disadvantaged in important ways, and making health services free is unlikely to be enough to close these remaining gaps. In addition to gender gaps, there are also stark health gaps between eldest sons, whom parents favor, and other sons. Fertility preferences likewise center on eldest sons. The desire to have at least one son — who can fill that eldest son role in the family — drives the skewed sex ratio, and this preference shows little sign of abating. In fact, the downward trend in family size is exacerbating how the desire for a son translates into sex-selection. Families’ quest for a son also imposes collateral damage on sisters’ health. The policy challenge, particularly around reducing the desire for sons, is large. Empowering women is not a panacea, and offering financial incentives to have daughters risks further concentrating girls in poorer families. While we do not know which policies will erase the disadvantages girls face, some that might advance this goal are public pensions as an alternative to old-age support from sons, increased delivery of health services through schools, and norm-change interventions that aim to increase the intrinsic value that Indian families place on girls.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31883,31883,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Long-term Care Around the World,"Jonathan Gruber, Kathleen M. McGarry, Charles Hanzel","The developed world is in the midst of an enormous demographic transition, with life expectancy increasing and fertility falling, leading to a rapid aging of the population.  This trend has critical implications for long-term care around the world.  This paper serves as the introduction to a volume that brings together experts from ten countries to compare long term care systems.  We find a number of important similarities: only a minority of those elderly receiving assistance rely solely on formal care (i.e. care in an institution or through paid home care) while the majority of care is provided informally by family or other unpaid caregivers; without public support, the cost of long-term care would be beyond the financial means of a large fraction of the elderly in each country, particularly for the oldest and most disabled; and the public sector bears the majority of the costs of formal long-term care in every country.  There are, however, important differences across countries, particularly in the extent to which formal care is delivered in institutions or at home, and in the division between the use of formal and informal care.  Given the importance of informal care across all countries studied, we conclude that any estimate of the social costs of long-term care must account for the implicit costs of informal care.  In undertaking such an evaluation of informal care, we find that it comprises at least one-third of all long-term care spending for all countries studied, with an average portion of nearly fifty percent.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31882,31882,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023

The Power of Proximity to Coworkers: Training for Tomorrow or Productivity Today?,"Natalia Emanuel, Emma Harrington, Amanda Pallais","Amidst the rise of remote work, we ask: what are the effects of proximity to coworkers? We find being near coworkers has tradeoffs: proximity increases long-run human capital development at the expense of short-term output. We study software engineers at a Fortune 500 firm, whose main campus has two buildings several blocks apart. When offices were open, engineers working in the same building as all their teammates received 22 percent more online feedback than engineers with distant teammates. After offices closed for COVID-19, this advantage largely disappears. Yet sitting together reduces engineers' programming output, particularly for senior engineers. The tradeoffs from proximity are more acute for women, who both do more mentoring and receive more mentorship when near their coworkers. Proximity impacts career trajectories, dampening short-run pay raises but boosting them in the long run. These results can help to explain national trends: workers in their twenties who often need mentorship and workers over forty who often provide mentorship are more likely to return to the office. However, even if most mentors and mentees go into the office, remote work may reduce interaction:  pre-COVID, having just one distant teammate reduced feedback among co-located workers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31880,31880,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023

International Trade Responses to Labor Market Regulations,Mathilde Muñoz,"This paper studies how differences in labor market regulations shape countries' comparative advantage in the cross-border provision of labor-intensive services, using administrative data in Europe for the last two decades. I exploit exogenous variation in labor taxes and minimum wages faced by exporting firms engaged in a large European trade program.  Firms from different countries compete to supply the same physical service in the same location but their employees are subject to different payroll taxes and minimum wages.  These rules varied across countries,  sectors, and over time.  Reduced-form country case-studies as well as model-implied gravity estimates show evidence of large trade responses to lower labor taxes and minimum wages, with an elasticity that is around one.  The Bolkestein directive, by exempting foreign firms from all labor regulations in the destination country,  would have doubled exports of physical services from Eastern European countries, rationalizing the wave of protests in high-wage countries that led to the withdrawal of the proposal.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31876,31876,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023

Our starting point is the Vayanos and Vila (2009, 2021) model of the term structure of default-free bond yields, which we present in both discrete and continuous time. The key friction in the model is that the bond market is partially segmented from other financial markets: the prices of short-rate and bond supply risk are set by specialized bond arbitrageurs who must absorb shocks to the supply and demand for bonds from other “preferred-habitat” agents.

Methadone, one of just three medications approved by the Food & Drug Administration for opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment, was not covered by Medicare — the primary insurer of older Americans — for OUD until 2020. We study the response of opioid treatment programs (OTPs), the only healthcare providers that can dispense methadone for OUD in the U.S., to this landmark policy change using administrative data and a difference—in—differences framework. We examine two outcomes: provider acceptance of Medicare payment and the number of treatment episodes, before and after the policy change, in OTPs relative to other substance use disorder treatment facilities.

A platform dynamically offers one of n products to a user who slowly learns product quality. User learning depends on a product’s “glossiness,’ which captures attributes that make products appear more attractive than they are. AI tools enable platforms to learn glossiness and engage in behavioral manipulation. We establish that AI benefits consumers when glossiness is short-lived. In contrast, when glossiness is long-lived, users suffer because of behavioral manipulation. Finally, as the number of products increases, the platform can intensify behavioral manipulation by presenting more low-quality, glossy products.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31872,31872,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Heterogeneous and Racialized Impacts of State Incarceration Policies on Birth Outcomes in the U.S.,"Courtney Boen, Elizabeth Bair, Hedwig Lee, Atheendar Venkataramani","While state incarceration policies have received much attention in research on the causes of mass incarceration in the U.S., their roles in shaping population health and health disparities remain largely unknown. We examine the impacts of two signature state incarceration policies adopted during the “tough on crime” era of the 1990s—three strikes and truth in sentencing—on Black and White birth outcomes. Using a difference-in-differences event study research design that models the dynamic impacts of these policies over time, we find that these policies had opposing effects on birth outcomes. We find that birth weight outcomes—including mean birth weight and low birth weight—for Black infants worsened markedly in the year three strikes policies were adopted. By contrast, birth outcomes for Black and White infants gradually improved after truth in sentencing policies were adopted. The discordant findings point to distinct, countervailing mechanisms by which sentencing policies can affect population health. We provide suggestive evidence that three strikes policies adversely impacted Black birth outcomes through affective mechanisms, by inducing highly racialized, stigmatizing public discourse around the time of policy adoption, while truth in sentencing likely impacted birth outcomes via material mechanisms, namely gradually reductions in community incarceration and crime rates. Altogether, these findings point to the need to further interrogate state criminal legal system policies for their impacts on population health, considering whether, how, and for whom these policies result in health impacts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31888,31888,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Late Bloomers: The Aggregate Implications of Getting Education Later in Life,"Zsófia L. Bárány, Moshe Buchinsky, Pauline Corblet","It is generally agreed upon that most individuals who acquire a college degree do so in their early 20s. Despite this consensus, we show that in the US from the 1930 birth cohort onwards a large fraction – around 20% – of college graduates obtained their degree after age 30. We explore the implications of this phenomenon. First, we show that these so-called late bloomers have significantly contributed to the narrowing of gender and racial gaps in the college share, despite the general widening of the racial gap. Second, late bloomers are responsible for more than half of the increase in the aggregate college share from 1960 onwards. Finally, we show that the returns to having a college degree vary depending on the age at graduation. Ignoring the existence of late bloomers therefore leads to a significant underestimation of the returns to college education for those finishing college in their early 20s.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31874,31874,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Long-term Care in Denmark,"Mette Gørtz, Bent Jesper Christensen, Nabanita Datta Gupta","The population is aging in Denmark, as in many other countries, due to increasing life expectancy and a low total fertility rate. This potentially puts the Danish welfare state under pressure. This paper discusses the demographic and socioeconomic situation of the elderly in Denmark, focusing on the health status and financial situation of the elderly, and the provision of long-term care (LTC). We rely on a combination of survey data, mainly from the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), and high-quality register data covering the entire Danish population. We find that a large fraction of the elderly is in good health, but that those in the older age group, 85+, face considerably more functional limitations in daily living. One in three of the elderly receives some form of long-term care, and more than half the 85+ group. The paper further identifies a number of current challenges regarding organization of the long-term care sector, including recruitment of personnel for health care and LTC. Finally, the paper sheds light on the extent of informal care provided by family and friends. While informal care is offered voluntarily and is generally unpaid, it represents a substantial opportunity cost to society.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31889,31889,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
The Extent of the Market for Early American Bank Notes,Howard Bodenhorn,"How far did antebellum bank notes travel? Up to now, we did not know. Using previously overlooked data on interbank holdings of bank notes and the records of a small-time note broker, I find that most bank notes circulated within about 50 miles of the issuing banks. Few notes were observed from as far as 200 miles away. Several studies of secondary markets for privately issued currencies assume that notes moved across vast geographic space, but these new findings suggest that we may need new models of bank note pricing and the efficiency of relatively unfettered markets in private currencies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31886,31886,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Pandemic-Era Inflation Drivers and Global Spillovers,"Julian di Giovanni, Ṣebnem Kalemli-Özcan, Alvaro Silva, Muhammed A. Yildirim","We estimate a multi-country multi-sector New Keynesian model to quantify the drivers of domestic inflation during 2020–2023 in several countries, including the United States. The model matches observed inflation together with sector-level prices and wages. We further measure the relative importance of different types of shocks on inflation across countries over time. The key mechanism, the international transmission of demand, supply and energy shocks through global linkages helps us to match the behavior of the USD/Euro exchange rate. The quantification exercise yields four key findings. First, negative supply shocks to factors of production, labor and intermediate inputs, initially sparked inflation in 2020–2021. Global supply chains and complementarities in production played an amplification role in this initial phase. Second, positive aggregate demand shocks, due to stimulative policies, widened demand-supply imbalances, amplifying inflation further during 2021–2022. Third, the reallocation of consumption between goods and service sectors, a relative sector-level demand shock, played a role in transmitting these imbalances across countries through the global trade and production network. Fourth, global energy shocks have differential impacts on the US relative to other countries’ inflation rates. Further, complementarities between energy and other inputs to production play a particularly important role in the quantitative impact of these shocks on inflation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31887,31887,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023

Our research reveals persistent geographic variation in C- section rates for both low- and high-risk groups. Counties with elevated C-section rates consistently perform more C-sections across mothers at all levels of appropriateness for the procedure. These elevated rates of C-section in high C-section counties are associated with reduced maternal and infant morbidity. We also find that C-section decisions are less responsive to underlying risks for Black mothers relative to white mothers, suggesting potential welfare-reducing disparities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31871,31871,23-Nov,NBER,11/20/2023
Federal Reserve Structure and the Production of Monetary Policy Ideas,"Michael D. Bordo, Edward S. Prescott","We evaluate the decentralized structure of the Federal Reserve System as a mechanism for generating and processing new ideas on monetary policy over the 1960 - 2000 period. We document the introduction of monetarism, rational expectations, credibility, transparency, and other monetary policy ideas by Reserve Banks into the Federal Reserve System. We argue that the Reserve Banks were willing to support and develop new ideas due to internal reforms to the FOMC that Chairman William McChesney Martin implemented in the 1950s and the increased ties with academia that developed in this period. Furthermore, the Reserve Banks were able to succeed at this because of their private-public governance structure. We illustrate this with a time-consistency model in which a decentralized organization is better at producing new ideas than a centralized one. We argue that this role of the Reserve Banks is an important benefit of the Federal Reserve’s decentralized structure by allowing for more competition in formulating ideas and by reducing groupthink.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2329-frs-structure-and-monetary-policy-idea-production,23-29,11.20.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/21/2023

A simple framework illustrating the numerous channels of the transmission mechanism of surprise inflation to household welfare guides our empirical exercise. By combining micro data and aggregate time series, we conclude that: (i) country-level average welfare costs –expressed as a share of 2021–22 income– were larger than a typical recession, and heterogeneous, e.g., 3% in France and 8% in Italy; (ii) this inflation episode resembles an age-dependent tax, with the elderly losing up to 20%, and roughly half of the 25–44 year-old winning; (iii) losses were quite uniform across consumption quantiles because rigid rents served as a hedge for the poor; (iv) nominal net positions are the key driver of heterogeneity across-households; (v) the rise in energy prices generated vast variation in individual-level inflation rates, but unconventional fiscal policies were critical in shielding the most vulnerable households.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2877~698cc193b0.en.pdf?a2f23a2307e8083a3fa1beadb61ad281,2877,23-Nov-23,ECB,11/21/2023
Retail Central Bank Digital Currencies: Implications for Banking and Financial Stability,"Sebastian Infante, Kyungmin Kim, Anna Orlik, André F. Silva, Robert J. Tetlow","This paper reviews the literature examining how the introduction of a retail CBDC would affect the banking sector and financial stability. A CBDC has the potential to improve welfare by reducing financial frictions, countering market power in deposit markets and enhancing the payment system. However, a CBDC also entails noteworthy risks, including the possibility of bank disintermediation and associated contraction in bank credit, as well as potential adverse effects on financial stability. The recycling of the new CBDC liability through asset purchases or lending by the central bank plays an important role in determining the economic consequences of the introduction of a CBDC. A CBDC also raises important questions regarding the footprint of central banks in the financial system. Ultimately, the effects of a CBDC depend critically on its design features, of which remuneration is the one discussed most often in the literature.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/retail-central-bank-digital-currencies-implications-for-banking-and-financial-stability.htm,2023-072,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/21/2023
Borrowing and Spending in the Money: Debt Substitution and the Cash-out Refinance Channel of Monetary Policy,"Elliot Anenberg, Tess Scharlemann, Eileen van Straelen","We show that the strong negative effect of higher mortgage rates on cash-out refinancing reflects substitution into other borrowing products, not large changes in total new household borrowing. We exploit an exogenous increase in long-term rates to show that, in the cross-section of outstanding mortgage rates, changes in cash-out and alternative borrowing are offsetting. Additionally, we instrument using monetary policy surprises to show that, over the period from 2006-2021, changes in cash-out refinancing are offset by alternative borrowing. Our results suggest that debt substitution substantially weakens the cash-out refinance channel of monetary policy and reduces its path-dependence.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/borrowing-and-spending-in-the-money.htm,2023-073,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/21/2023
Predictive Density Combination Using a Tree-Based Synthesis Function,"Tony Chernis, Niko Hauzenberger, Florian Huber, Gary Koop, James Mitchell","Bayesian predictive synthesis (BPS) provides a method for combining multiple predictive distributions based on agent/expert opinion analysis theory and encompasses a range of existing density forecast pooling methods. The key ingredient in BPS is a “synthesis” function. This is typically specified parametrically as a dynamic linear regression. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric treatment of the synthesis function using regression trees. We show the advantages of our tree-based approach in two macroeconomic forecasting applications. The first uses density forecasts for GDP growth from the euro area’s Survey of Professional Forecasters. The second combines density forecasts of US inflation produced by many regression models involving different predictors. Both applications demonstrate the benefits – in terms of improved forecast accuracy and interpretability – of modeling the synthesis function nonparametrically.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2330-predictive-density-combination,23-30,11.21.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/21/2023
Informal Work and Official Employment Statistics: What’s Missing?,Anat Bracha and Mary A. Burke,"Using eight consecutive waves of the Survey of Informal Work Participation (SIWP) spanning 2015 through 2022, we investigate informal “gig” work participation in the United States—broadly defined to include online and offline activities—and its implications for the measurement of employment. Our results suggest that employment rates among US household heads were consistently understated in the Current Population Survey (CPS). Under conservative estimates, we find that the employment-to-population ratio would have been 0.25 to 1.1 percentage points higher over the 2015–2022 period and as much as 5.1 percentage points higher under more generous estimates. Along the intensive margin, we find evidence that a significant number of informal work hours are missing from official employment surveys, partly because employed individuals do not fully report their informal hours.  Comparing informal workers who are classified as employed by the CPS with those who are arguably misclassified as nonemployed, we find that the latter are, on average, older, less educated, and less likely to cite income as a motivation for gig work, and an elevated share are disabled. The data also indicate that certain types of income-earning activities, such as renting and selling, are less likely to be perceived as “work.”  These results suggest ways to improve official surveys to better capture those employed in gig work and obtain a fuller picture of the labor market.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/informal-work-and-official-employment-statistics-whats-missing,23-15,21-Nov-23,FED-BOSTON,11/21/2023
"Uncovered interest rate, overshooting, and predictability reversal puzzles in an emerging economy",Rehim Kilic,"By using realized and survey-based expected exchange rate data, the paper presents five key findings regarding the Uncovered Interest rate Parity (UIP) and related puzzles in an Emerging Market (EM). First, Fama regressions, when not accounting for shifts in the UIP relationship, yield slopes that are statistically identical to one, irrespective of whether survey-based expected exchange rates or realized exchange rates are used. Second, caution is necessary however, as our analysis identifies three distinct sub-periods within each exchange rate measure, each exhibiting varying levels of puzzling behavior. Third, under realized exchange rates, expectation errors can introduce both downward and upward biases or no bias at all, depending on the sub-period. On the other hand, currency risk premiums consistently lead to a downward bias. Under expected exchange rates, currency risk premiums continue to exert a downward bias at varying degrees across sub-periods. Fourth, responses to interest rate differential shocks by expectation errors are pivotal in inducing both downward and upward biases or removing biases altogether when utilizing realized exchange rate data. Fifth, evidence concerning overshooting and reversal puzzles, as well as their link to the UIP puzzle, varies depending on the specific sub-period and the choice of exchange rate measurement, making it more intricate than the previous literature has documented.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/uncovered-interest-rate-overshooting-and-predictability-reversal-puzzles-in-an-emerging-economy.htm,2023-074,23-Nov,FED-BOARD,11/25/2023
Supply Chain Constraints and Inflation,"Diego Comin, Robert Johnson, Callum Jones","We develop a multisector, open economy, New Keynesian framework to evaluate how potentially binding capacity constraints, and shocks to them, shape inflation.

Further, data on prices and quantities together identify whether constraints bind due to increased demand or reductions in capacity. Applying the model to interpret recent US data, we find that binding constraints explain half of the increase in inflation during 2021-2022.

Stakeholders’ Aversion to Inequality and Bank Lending to Minorities,Matteo Crosignani and Hanh Le,"We find that banks differ in their propensity to lend to minorities based on their stakeholders’ aversion to inequality. Using mortgage application data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, we document a large and persistent cross-sectional variation in banks’ propensity to lend to minorities. Inequality-averse banks have a higher propensity to lend to borrowers in high-minority areas and, within census tracts, to non-white borrowers compared to other banks. This higher propensity (i) is not explained by selection of applicants, (ii) allows these banks to retain and attract their inequality-averse stakeholders, and (iii) does not predict worse ex-post loan performance.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1079.html,1079,23-Nov,FED-NEWYORK,11/25/2023
Taming Financial Dollarization: Determinants and Effective Policies – The Case of Uruguay,"Mauricio Vargas, Jesus Sanchez","With some of the most significant levels of financial dollarization in the Western Hemisphere, Uruguay is characterized by extensive dollarization in both deposits and loans. While traditional factors like high inflation and substantial devaluations have been associated with such outcome, the enduring nature of dollarization in Uruguay also underscores the importance of structural elements.

Moderation or indulgence? Effects of bank distribution restrictions during stress,"Jonathan Acosta-Smith, Jozef Barunik, Eddie Gerba and Petros Katsoulis","At the onset of the Covid‑19 crisis, several regulatory authorities issued a recommendation or request to banks to restrict their dividend and share buyback distributions. The purpose of this action was to increase banks’ resilience by not distributing retained earnings, and help them support the real economy given their unique role in doing so. These restrictions reflected the singular circumstances brought by Covid‑19. We evaluate the impact of these restrictions on banks’ resilience, lending and investors’ required rate of return. First, using a difference‑in‑differences analysis on an international sample of European banks, we find that restricted banks increased their available Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital and resilience in every quarter while the restrictions were fully in place, before gradually reducing it once they were partly lifted. Second, using a data set on the universe of UK small and medium‑sized enterprise (SME) loans issued by nine UK banking groups, we find that restricted banks increased their lending volumes on smaller non‑government guaranteed loans throughout the implementation period. Third, using the international sample of European banks, we find that the restrictions increased shareholders’ required rate of return throughout the implementation period, with the impact on the required rate of return on capital partially offset by lower debtholders’ required rate of return.

Do debt investors care about ESG ratings?,"Kornelia Fabisik, Michael Ryf, Larissa Schäfer, Sascha Steffen","We study the effect of changes in firms’ ESG ratings on the cost of debt of U.S. firms using a methodology change of an ESG rating provider. We find that loan spreads of downgraded ESG-rated firms in the secondary corporate loan market increase by about 10% compared to non-downgraded ESG-rated firms after the methodology change. The effect of ESG rating downgrades is not driven by the increase in the fundamental default risk of firms but rather by the premium charged by investors above the spread for default risk. The effect is stronger for firms that are more financially constrained, firms that are more exposed to ESG and, particularly, climate risk concerns as well as firms that are more held by climate-concerned lenders.

Mitigating Climate Change at the Firm Level: Mind the Laggards,"Damien Capelle, Divya Kirti, Nicola Pierri, German Villegas Bauer","Using self-reported data on emissions for a global sample of 4,000 large, listed firms, we document large heterogeneity in environmental performance within the same industry and country. Laggards— firms with high emissions relative to the scale of their operations—are larger, operate older physical capital stocks, are less knowledge intensive and productive, and adopt worse management practices. To rationalize these findings, we build a novel general equilibrium heterogeneous-firm model in which firms choose capital vintages and R&D expenditure and hence emissions. The model matches the full empirical distribution of firmlevel heterogeneity among other moments. Our counter-factual analysis shows that this heterogeneity matters for assessing the macroeconomic costs of mitigation policies, the channels through which policies act, and their distributional effects.

Fed Transparency and Policy Expectation Errors: A Text Analysis Approach,"Eric Fischer, Rebecca McCaughrin, Saketh Prazad, and Mark Vandergon","This paper seeks to estimate the extent to which market-implied policy expectations could be improved with further information disclosure from the FOMC. Using text analysis methods based on large language models, we show that if FOMC meeting materials with five-year lagged release dates—like meeting transcripts and Tealbooks—were accessible to the public in real time, market policy expectations could substantially improve forecasting accuracy. Most of this improvement occurs during easing cycles. For instance, at the six-month forecasting horizon, the market could have predicted as much as 125 basis points of additional easing during the 2001 and 2008 recessions, equivalent to a 40-50 percent reduction in mean squared error. This potential forecasting improvement appears to be related to incomplete information about the Fed’s reaction function, particularly with respect to financial stability concerns in 2008.

Optimal Subsidies for Green Hydrogen Production,"Harrison Fell, Stephen P. Holland, Andrew J. Yates","Green hydrogen may decarbonize sectors which are difficult to electrify, and the recent Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides tax credits to encourage hydrogen production.   We analyze a model in which hydrogen produced using electricity replaces natural gas. The electricity may be procured from dedicated renewables or from the grid with and without offsetting.  In the absence of Pigouvian taxation, optimal hydrogen subsidies are positive if the unpriced externality from avoided natural gas is larger than the unpriced externality from electricity.    With optimally differentiated subsidies, offsetting increases welfare.  With undifferentiated subsidies, offsetting can decrease welfare, unless it is restricted to regions with higher unpriced electricity externalities.  Short-run parameterization shows that the IRA's subsidy of $3/kg-H2 is rationalized:  i) by hydrogen production from dedicated renewables if the social cost of carbon (SCC) is $500 or ii) by hydrogen production from the (relatively clean) grid in California with renewables offsetting (relatively dirty) electricity in the non-RGGI East if the SCC is $185.

How Do Households Respond to Income Shocks?,"Dirk Krueger, Egor Malkov, Fabrizio Perri","We use panel data from the Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth from 1991 to 2016 to document empirically what components of the household budget constraint change in response to shocks to household labor income, both over shorter and over longer horizons. We show that shocks to labor income are associated with negligible changes in transfers and non-labor income components, modest changes in consumption expenditures, and large changes in wealth. We then split the sample in households which do not own business or real estate wealth, and households who do. For the first group, we find that consumption responses are more substantial (and increasing with the horizon of the income shock) and wealth responses are much smaller. We show that, for this group, a version of the standard PIH framework that allows for partial insurance against even permanent income shocks can explain well the consumption and wealth responses, both at short and long horizons. For the second group the standard framework cannot explain the large changes in wealth associated with income shocks. We conclude that models which include shocks to the value of household wealth are necessary to fully evaluate the sources and the consequences of household resource risk.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31894,31894,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
The Impact of Commercial Real Estate Regulations on U.S. Output,"Fil Babalievsky, Kyle F. Herkenhoff, Lee E. Ohanian, Edward C. Prescott","Commercial real estate accounts for roughly 20% of the U.S. fixed asset stock, and commercial land use is highly regulated. However, little is known about the quantitative impact of these regulations on economic activity or consumer welfare. This paper develops a spatial general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy that includes commercial real estate regulations and congestion effects, the latter of which provide a rationale for such regulations. The model is tailored to exploit the near-universe of CoreLogic's commercial, parcel-level, property tax records to construct a quantitative index of commercial real estate regulations for nearly every commercial property. We use the model to evaluate the positive and normative impacts of commercial land use deregulations. Moderately relaxing commercial regulations across all U.S. cities yields large allocative efficiency effects, with output gains of about 3 percent to 6 percent and welfare gains of about 3 percent to 9 percent of lifetime consumption. We also find significant positive and normative gains from deregulation with 40 percent of the labor force working remotely.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31895,31895,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023

By combining micro data and aggregate time series, we conclude that: (i) country-level average welfare costs—expressed as a share of 2021–22 income—were larger than a typical recession, and heterogeneous, e.g., 3% in France and 8% in Italy; (ii) this inflation episode resembles an age-dependent tax, with the elderly losing up to 20%, and roughly half of the 25–44 year-old winning; (iii) losses were quite uniform across consumption quantiles because rigid rents served as a hedge for the poor; (iv) nominal net positions are the key driver of heterogeneity across-households; (v) the rise in energy prices generated vast variation in individual-level inflation rates, but unconventional fiscal policies were critical in shielding the most vulnerable households",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31896,31896,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
Sequential Search for Corporate Bonds,"Mahyar Kargar, Benjamin Lester, Sébastien Plante, Pierre-Olivier Weill","In over-the-counter (OTC) markets, customers search for counterparties. Little is known about this process, however, because existing data is comprised of transaction records, which are only informative about the end of a successful search. Leveraging data from the leading trading platform for corporate bonds, we offer evidence about the search process: we analyze customers’ repeated attempts to trade (successful and unsuccessful). We estimate that it takes two to three days to complete a transaction after an unsuccessful attempt, with substantial variation depending on trade and customer characteristics. Our analysis offers insights into the sources of trading delays in OTC markets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31904,31904,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
"Automation: Theory, Evidence, and Outlook",Pascual Restrepo,"This article reviews the literature on automation and its impact on labor markets, wages, factor shares, and productivity. I first introduce the task model and explain why this framework offers a compelling way to think about recent labor market trends and the effects of automation technologies. The task model clarifies that automation technologies operate by substituting capital for labor in a widening range of tasks. This substitution reduces costs, creating a positive productivity effect, but also reduces employment opportunities for workers displaced from automated tasks, creating a negative displacement effect. I  survey the empirical literature and conclude that there is wide qualitative support for the implications of task models and the displacement effects of automation. I conclude by discussing shortcomings of the existing literature and avenues for future research.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31910,31910,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
Contingent Credit Under Stress,"Viral V. Acharya, Maximilian Jager, Sascha Steffen","Over the past two decades, banks have increasingly focused on offering contingent credit in the form of credit lines as a primary means of corporate borrowing. We review the existing body of research regarding the rationales for banks’ provision of liquidity insurance in the form of credit lines, their significance in managing corporate liquidity, and the reasons and circumstances under which firms opt to utilize them. We emphasize that the options for firms to both draw down and repay credit lines are put options issued by banks, which are exercised by firms in a correlated manner during periods of widespread stress, with adverse affects on bank intermediation thereafter. We discuss the bank capital and the bank funding channels that can drive these effects, contrasting their roles during the Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 outbreak. We conclude by discussing the increasing extension of bank credit lines to non-bank financial intermediaries, as well as the role of stress tests and monetary policy in managing the risks of contingent credit under stress.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31909,31909,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
The Effect of Public Science on Corporate R&D,"Ashish Arora, Sharon Belenzon, Larisa C. Cioaca, Lia Sheer, Hansen Zhang","We study the relationships between corporate R&D and three components of public science: knowledge, human capital, and invention. We identify the relationships through firm-specific exposure to changes in federal agency R\&D budgets that are driven by the political composition of congressional appropriations subcommittees. Our results indicate that R&D by established firms, which account for more than three-quarters of business R&D, is affected by scientific knowledge produced by universities only when the latter is embodied in inventions or PhD scientists. Human capital trained by universities fosters innovation in firms. However, inventions from universities and public research institutes substitute for corporate inventions and reduce the demand for internal research by corporations, perhaps reflecting downstream competition from startups that commercialize university inventions. Moreover, abstract knowledge advances per se elicit little or no response. Our findings question the belief that public science represents a non-rival public good that feeds into corporate R&D through knowledge spillovers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31899,31899,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
One-Sided Limited Commitment and Aggregate Risk,"Yoshiki Ando, Dirk Krueger, Harald Uhlig","In this paper we study the neoclassical growth model with idiosyncratic income risk and aggregate risk in which risk sharing is endogenously constrained by one-sided limited commitment. Households can trade a full set of contingent claims that pay off depending on both idiosyncratic and aggregate risk, but limited commitment rules out that households sell these assets short. The model results, under suitable restrictions of the parameters of the model, in partial consumption insurance in equilibrium. With log-utility and idiosyncratic income shocks taking two values one of which is zero (e.g., employment and unemployment) we show that the equilibrium can be characterized in closed form, despite the fact that it features a non-degenerate consumption- and wealth distribution. We use the tractability of the model to study, analytically, inequality over the business cycle and asset pricing, and derive conditions under which our model has identical, as well as conditions under which it has lower/higher risk premia than the corresponding representative agent version of the model.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31903,31903,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
The High Frequency Effects of Dollar Swap Lines,"Rohan Kekre, Moritz Lenel","We study the effects of dollar swap lines using high frequency responses in asset prices around policy announcements.  News about expanded dollar swap lines causes a reduction in liquidity premia, compression of deviations from covered interest parity (CIP), and depreciation of the dollar.  Equity prices rise and the VIX falls, while the response of long-term government bond prices is mixed.  The cross-section of high frequency responses implies that swap lines affect the dollar factor or the price of risk.  Our findings are qualitatively consistent with models relating the supply of dollar liquidity to the broader economy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31901,31901,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
Evaluating Tax Harmonization,James R. Hines Jr.,"Tax harmonization entails a uniform rate that may not suit all governments.  Harmonization can advance collective governmental objectives only if the standard deviation of tax rates is less than the average downward effect of tax competition on rates.  Since an efficient harmonized tax rate undoes the effect of competition, an efficient rate equals or exceeds the sum of the observed average tax rate and the standard deviation of rates.  In 2020, the mean world corporate tax rate was 25.9%, and the standard deviation 4.5%, so if there is an efficient harmonized world tax rate, it must be 30.4% or higher.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31900,31900,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
Risk-On Risk-Off: A Multifaceted Approach to Measuring Global Investor Risk Aversion,"Anusha Chari, Karlye Dilts Stedman, Christian Lundblad","This paper defines risk-on risk-off (RORO), an elusive terminology in pervasive use, as the variation in global investor risk aversion. Our high-frequency RORO index captures time-varying investor risk appetite across multiple dimensions: advanced economy credit risk, equity market volatility, funding conditions, and currency dynamics. The index exhibits risk-off skewness and pronounced fat tails, suggesting its amplifying potential for extreme, destabilizing events. Compared with the conventional VIX measure, the RORO index reflects the multifaceted nature of risk, underscoring the diverse provenance of investor risk sentiment. Practical applications of the RORO index highlight its significance for international portfolio reallocation and return predictability.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31907,31907,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
Cost-Sharing in Medical Care Can Increase Adult Mortality: Evidence from Colombia,"Giancarlo Buitrago, Javier Amaya-Nieto, Grant Miller, Marcos Vera-Hernández","There is substantial evidence that cost-sharing in medical care constrains total health spending.  However, there is relatively little (and unclear) evidence on its health effects, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This paper re-evaluates the link between outpatient cost-sharing and health, studying Colombia’s entire formal sector workforce observed monthly between 2011 and 2018 with individual-level health care utilization records linked to payroll data and vital statistics. Because Colombia’s national health system imposes discrete breaks in outpatient cost-sharing requirements across the earnings distribution, we estimate a dynamic regression discontinuity model, finding that greater outpatient cost-sharing initially reduces use of outpatient care (including consultations and drugs), resulting in fewer diagnoses of common chronic diseases – and over time, increases the prevalence and severity of chronic diseases as well as use of inpatient care. Ultimately, greater outpatient cost-sharing measurably increases mortality, raising 8-year mortality by 4 deaths per 10,000 individuals. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show a relationship between cost-sharing and adult mortality risk in a low- or middle-income country, a relationship important to incorporate into social welfare analyses of cost-sharing policies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31908,31908,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
"Risk, monetary policy and asset prices in a global world","Geert Bekaert, Marie Hoerova, Nancy R. Xu","We study how monetary policy and risk shocks affect asset prices in the US, the euro area, and Japan, differentiating between “traditional” monetary policy and communication events, each decomposed into “pure” and information shocks. Communication shocks from the US spill over to risk in the euro area and vice versa, but traditional US shocks show no spillover effects to risk. Both monetary policy and communication shocks spill over to stocks, with euro area information spillovers being particularly strong. US spillovers are consistent with global CAPM intuition whereas euro area spillovers are larger. Importantly, we document a strong global component of risk shocks which is not driven by monetary policy.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2879~06c76dacd5.en.pdf?3ad3396a18f090a2e9fe9ac2abbfd106,2879,27-Nov-23,ECB,11/27/2023
What Do Impact Investors Do Differently?,"Shawn Cole, Leslie Jeng, Josh Lerner, Natalia Rigol, Benjamin N. Roth","In recent years, impact investors – private investors who seek to generate simultaneously financial and social returns – have attracted intense interest and controversy. We analyze a novel, comprehensive data set of impact and traditional investors to assess how the non-financial characteristics of impact portfolios differ from their traditional counterparts. First, we document that they are more likely to invest in disadvantaged areas and nascent industries and exhibit more risk tolerance and patience. We then examine the degree to which impact investors expand the financing frontier, versus investing in companies that could have attracted traditional private financing. Utilizing a variety of network theoretic and event study analyses, we find limited support for the assertion that impact investors expand the financing frontier, either in the deal-selection stage or the post-investment stage.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31898,31898,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
What to do when you can't use '1.96' Confidence Intervals for IV,"David S. Lee, Justin McCrary, Marcelo J. Moreira, Jack R. Porter, Luther Yap","To address the well-established large-sample invalidity of the +/-1.96 critical values for the t-ratio in the single variable just-identified IV model, applied research typically qualifies the inference based on the first-stage-F (Staiger and Stock (1997) and Stock and Yogo (2005)). We fully extend this F-based approach to its logical conclusion by presenting new critical values for the t-ratio to additionally accommodate values of F that do not meet existing thresholds needed for validity. These new t-ratio critical values simultaneously fix the main problem of over-rejection (invalidity) and the under-appreciated possibility of under-rejection (conservativeness) that can occur when relying solely on the usual 1.96 critical value. We show that the corresponding new confidence intervals are generally expected to be substantially shorter than competing “robust to weak instrument” intervals, including those from the recommended benchmark of Anderson and Rubin (1949) (AR). In a sample of 89 specifications from 10 recent empirical studies drawn from five general interest journals, the new “VtF” intervals are shorter than AR intervals 100 percent of the time, and even more likely to produce statistically significant results than the usual +/-1.96 procedure.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31893,31893,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
Learning by Investing: Entrepreneurial Spillovers from Venture Capital,"Josh Lerner, Jinlin Li, Tong Liu","This paper studies how investing in venture capital (VC) affects the entrepreneurial outcomes of individual limited partners (LPs). Using comprehensive administrative data on entrepreneurial activities and VC fundraising and investments in China, we first document that individual LPs, on average, contribute about 50% of the capital of each fund in which they participate, and over 50% of them are entrepreneurs. We then exploit an identification strategy by comparing the entrepreneurial outcomes of individual LPs in funds that eventually launched with those in funds that failed to launch. The fraction of committed capital from corporate LPs in industries that subsequently encounter poor returns is used as an instrument for funds’ launch failures. We find that after investing in a successfully launched VC fund, individual LPs create significantly more ventures than do LPs in funds which failed to launch. These new ventures tend to be high-tech firms and file more patents than do the LPs’ prior ventures. We find evidence consistent with venture investments being a channel through which individual LPs learn.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31897,31897,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
Schooling and Intergenerational Mobility: Consequences of Expanding Higher Education Institutions,"Noemí Katzkowicz, Victor Lavy, Martina Querejeta, Tatiana Rosá","Poor post-secondary education infrastructure and opportunities partly explain the low higher education rates in developing countries. This paper estimates the effect of a program that improved post-secondary education infrastructure by building many university campuses across Uruguay. Leveraging temporal and geographic variation in program implementation, we use a two-way fixed effect design and comprehensive administrative records to assess the program’s causal impact. By lowering the distance to a university campus, the program successfully increased university enrollment, particularly of less privileged students who are the first in their families to attend a university. The program impacted students from localities up to 30 kilometers from the new campus, reducing spatial inequality. Importantly, this expansion did not lower university completion rates. Furthermore, the program increased high school attendance and completion rates and the proportion of educated workers in the affected localities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31906,31906,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023

New Views Of Structural Transformation: Insights From Recent Literature,"Douglas Gollin, Joseph P.

This literature focuses on a set of related patterns of change that accompany the processes of growth and development. Traditionally, the focus has been on industrialization – and more broadly the reallocation of employment and economic activity from agriculture to manufacturing and services. The new literature considers a broader set of transformations: from rural to urban, from home to market (and from market to home), from informal to formal, and from self-employment to wage work. Drawing on new data sources, including micro data and administrative records, the literature tries to understand the complex interactions of a broad set of market failures, policy distortions, and impediments to the growth process. In broadening the understanding of structural transformation – to encompass processes beyond industrialization – this literature opens the door to a richer understanding of the processes of growth and a wider set of potential levers for policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31905,31905,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023
The Voting Premium,"Doron Y. Levit, Nadya Malenko, Ernst G.

A voting premium emerges when a minority blockholder tries to influence the composition of the shareholder base by accumulating votes and buying shares from dissenting shareholders. Empirical measures of the voting premium do not reflect the value of voting rights or voting power. A negative voting premium results from free-riding by dispersed shareholders on the blockholder’s trades. Conflicts between dispersed shareholders and the blockholder endogenously increase the liquidity of voting shares, but do not necessarily increase the voting premium.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31892,31892,23-Nov,NBER,11/27/2023

The financial origins of regional inequality," Anne Beck, Sebastian Doerr","An increasing number of policies addresses spatial inequality, which is believed to lie at the heart of economic and social cleavages, including entrenched poverty, deaths of despair, and political polarization. Yet little is known about the origins of the gap between prospering urban and ""left-behind"" rural areas that has emerged since the 1980s. We provide new evidence on the role of banking deregulation in explaining this rural-urban divergence in incomes. In particular, we show that the income gap widened following the removal of geographic restrictions on banking. While deregulation promoted an overall increase in incomes, the increase was significantly larger in urban counties. We show that this is due to increased competition in the banking industry in cities post deregulation. Competition benefited financially constrained small and young firms, thereby boosting employment and incomes in urban areas. Our findings inform the debate on regional inequality and the design of place-based policies.",https://www.bis.org/publ/work1151.htm,https://www.bis.org/publ/work1151,11/29/2023,BIS,11/29/2023

The Opioid Epidemic and Consumer Credit Supply: Evidence from Credit Cards,"Sumit Agarwal, Wenli Li, Raluca A. Roman, Nonna Sorokina","To identify causal effects, we employ instrumental variables, propensity score matching, and contiguous counties techniques and control for varying local economic conditions and demographics. We find that banks contract credit supply to consumers in counties highly exposed to opioid abuse by offering higher interest rates, lower credit card limits, and fewer rewards and reducing credit offers overall. Further analyses using the supervisory Federal Reserve Y-14M credit card data set confirm these effects. What is more, the credit contraction disproportionately impacts riskier consumers, minorities (particularly Black people), low-income consumers, and younger individuals. Our examination of various state-level anti-opioid abuse legislation shows that opioid supply-oriented laws are somewhat helpful in curbing opioid overdoses or mitigating the credit supply contraction, but demand-oriented laws are not. Finally, we uncover the real effects associated with the opioid abuse-induced credit contraction: Local consumer spending significantly declines in the highly affected areas, with important macro-policy implications.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-finance/consumer-credit/the-opioid-epidemic-and-consumer-credit-supply-evidence-from-credit-cards,23-28,20-Nov-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,11/29/2023

Cross sectional differences in modifications are substantial and amplified by borrower distress. Relative to single-lender loans, syndicated loans are 1.5 times more likely to be modified and interest rate changes are twice as likely.

Most multinationals have many of these exposures simultaneously within the same foreign market. Returns and cash flows of two companies comove when exposed to the same country through the same channel.

Housing Affordability: A New Dataset,"Nina Biljanovska, Chenxu Fu, Deniz O Igan","The rapid increase in house prices in the past few years, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, raises concerns about housing affordability. The price-to-income ratio is a widely-used indicator of affordability, but does not take into account important factors such as the cost of financing. The aim of this paper is to construct a measure of housing affordability that takes these factors into account for a large set of countries and long period of time. The resulting dataset covers an unbalanced panel of 40 countries over the period from 1970Q1 to 2021Q4. For each country, the index measures the extent to which a median-income household can qualify for a mortgage loan to purchase an average-priced home. To gauge the performance of the constructed indices, we compare them to other readily-available mesures of affordability and examine the evolution of the indices over time to understand the relevant drivers, including in a regression analysis to assess the extent to which government housing programs could contribute to improving affordability.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/01/Housing-Affordability-A-New-Dataset-541910,WPIEA2023247,"Fri, 01 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/4/2023

Family Trees and Falling Apples: Historical Intergenerational Mobility Estimates for Women and Men,"Kasey Buckles, Joseph Price, Zachary Ward, Haley E.B. Wilbert","Efforts to document long-term trends in socioeconomic mobility in the United States have been hindered by the lack of large, representative datasets that include information linking parents to their adult children. This problem has been especially acute for women, who are more difficult to link because their surnames often change between childhood and adulthood. In this paper, we use a new dataset, the Census Tree, that overcomes these issues by building on information from an online genealogy platform. Users of the platform have private information that allows them to create links among the 1850 to 1940 decennial censuses; the Census Tree combines these links with others obtained using machine learning and traditional linking methods to produce a dataset with hundreds of millions of census-to-census links, nearly half of which are for women. With these data, we produce estimates of the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status from fathers to their sons and daughters. We find that for married men and women, the patterns of mobility over this period are remarkably similar. Single women, however, are less mobile than their male counterparts. We also present new estimates that show that assortative mating was much stronger than previously estimated for the US.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31918,31918,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023

The Impact of a Man-made Disaster on Consumer Credit Outcomes: Evidence from the 2018 Merrimack Valley Natural Gas Explosions,Bo Zhao,"This paper is the first to empirically examine the impact of a man-made disaster on consumer credit outcomes. It uses the 2018 Merrimack Valley natural gas explosions as a quasi-random natural experiment and shows that the explosions had a temporary negative effect on debt balances, credit limits, and the number of delinquencies, and did not affect credit scores. The decreases in debt balances and credit limits were likely driven by a decline in credit demand when the affected individuals faced severe life disruption, great uncertainty, and negative financial shocks associated with the disaster. It took some time for the explosions to have an impact on delinquencies, suggesting that the affected individuals may have received short-term forbearance or used default as a last resort. The lack of large, long-lasting effects of the explosions likely reflects the critical role that external assistance to the affected communities played in mitigating the disaster’s impact.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/the-impact-of-a-man-made-disaster-on-consumer-credit-outcomes,23-17,28-Nov-23,FED-BOSTON,12/4/2023
Winners and Losers from the U.S.-China Trade War,"Alicia H. Dang, Kala Krishna, Yingyan Zhao","We investigate the phenomenon of trade re-allocations across countries as a result of the U.S.- China trade war. Using quarterly data on U.S. imports, we find evidence, as do others, of trade diversion in a range of industries and products, including products not targeted by U.S. tariffs on China. We are however the first to ask what seems to drive these trade reallocation activities. First, we show that they seem to be driven by differences in comparative advantage across countries: countries with a greater revealed comparative advantage in a product benefit (in terms of exports to the U.S.) more from U.S. tariffs on China. Second, we show that there is evidence of spillovers to similar non-targeted products: products in similar industries (as defined by their HS codes) are also similarly affected. This is consistent with the colocation effects. Third, our findings also suggest that bystander countries with greater capital abundance are more heavily impacted in capital-intensive industries, suggesting that a higher proportion of more flexible or transferable assets provides flexibility to alter production to respond to new trade opportunities. Finally, we show that the countries that export more to the U.S. as a result of the tariffs on China also export more to other countries. This suggests that firms are entering these countries and once there, export not just to the U.S. but everywhere.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31922,31922,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
The Distributional Predictive Content of Measures of Inflation Expectations,"James Mitchell, Saeed Zaman","This paper examines the predictive relationship between the distribution of realized inflation in the US and measures of inflation expectations from households, firms, financial markets, and professional forecasters. To allow for nonlinearities in the predictive relationship we use quantile regression methods. We find that the ability of households to predict future inflation, relative to that of professionals, firms, and the market, increases with inflation. While professional forecasters are more accurate in the middle of the inflation density, households’ expectations are more useful in the upper tail. The predictive ability of measures of inflation expectations is greatest when combined. We show that it is helpful to let the combination weights on different agents’ expectations of inflation vary by quantile when assessing inflationary pressures probabilistically.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2331-distributional-predictive-content-inflation-expectations-measures,23-31,11.30.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,12/4/2023
The Impact of AI and Cross-Border Data Regulation on International Trade in Digital Services: A Large Language Model,"Ruiqi Sun, Daniel Trefler","The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and of cross-border restrictions on data flows has created a host of new questions and related policy dilemmas. This paper addresses two questions: How is digital service trade shaped by (1) AI algorithms and (2) by the interplay between AI algorithms and cross-border restrictions on data flows? Answers lie in the palm of your hand: From London to Lagos, mobile app users trigger international transactions when they open AI-powered foreign apps. We have 2015-2020 usage data for the most popular 35,575 mobile apps and, to quantify the AI deployed in each of these apps, we use a large language model (LLM) to link each app to each of the app developer's AI patents. (This linkage of specific products to specific patents is a methodological innovation.) Armed with data on app usage by country, with AI deployed in each app, and with an instrument for AI (a Heckscher-Ohlin cost-shifter), we answer our two questions. (1) On average, AI causally raises an app's number of foreign users by 2.67 log points or by more than 10-fold.  (2) The impact of AI on foreign users is halved if the foreign users are in a country with strong restrictions on cross-border data flows.  These countries are usually autocracies. We also provide a new way of measuring AI knowledge spillovers across firms and find large spillovers. Finally, our work suggests numerous ways in which LLMs such as ChatGPT can be used in other applications.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31925,31925,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023

We find both an average job-seeker's preference for ESG and a large degree of heterogeneity across socioeconomic groups, with the strongest preference displayed by highly educated, white, and politically liberal individuals. We combine our experimental estimates with administrative matched employer-employee microdata and estimate an equilibrium model of the labor market.

The Wealth of Working Nations,"Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Gustavo Ventura, Wen Yao","Due to population aging, GDP growth per capita and GDP growth per working-age adult have become quite different among many advanced economies over the last several decades. Countries whose GDP growth per capita performance has been lackluster, like Japan, have done surprisingly well in terms of GDP growth per working-age adult. Indeed, from 1998 to 2019, Japan has grown slightly faster than the U.S. in terms of per working-age adult: an accumulated 31.9% vs. 29.5%. Furthermore, many advanced economies appear to be on parallel balanced growth trajectories in terms of working-age adults despite important differences in levels. Motivated by this observation, we calibrate a standard neoclassical growth model in which the growth of the working-age adult population varies in line with the data for each economy. Despite the underlying demographic differences, the calibrated model tracks output per working-age adult in most economies of our sample. Our results imply that the growth behavior of mature, aging economies is not puzzling from a theoretical perspective.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31914,31914,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Browsers Don’t Lie? Gender Differences in the Effects of the Indian COVID-19 Lockdown on Digital Activity and Time Use,"Amalia R. Miller, Kamalini Ramdas, Alp Sungu","We measure the impact of the initial Indian national COVID-19 lockdown on digital activity using browser histories of 1,094 individuals, spanning over 31.5 million website visits on computers and mobile devices. Reflecting the predicted increase in the value of online activity, both men and women in our sample dramatically increased their internet browsing during the lockdown. However, men’s browsing increased by significantly more, causing gender gaps overall and in key browsing categories, and in browsing on mobile devices. Our browser data showed significant relative reductions in women’s online job search, corroborated in aggregate data obtained from a major Indian online job platform, indicating potentially persistent harms to women’s employment. Consistent with increased childcare obligations driving the observed gender gaps, we find that gaps were greatest among parents. Men and women in our sample had similar browsing levels and trends pre-pandemic, which diverged during the lockdown. Our primary findings therefore shed new light on determinants of digital time use, while also highlighting the importance of considering both extensive and intensive margins of digital activity to track the digital divide. In our secondary analysis of time devoted to childcare, we find conflicting survey responses between fathers (who report an increase relative to mothers) and mothers (who report no such increase). While our data cannot directly resolve this conflict, they do show fathers having larger increases in time spent online, with no relative increase in childcare-related browsing. This secondary result demonstrates the value of complementing survey data with digital trace data.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31919,31919,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
The Role of Policy in Prison Growth and Decline,"Derek Neal, Armin Rick","Between 1975 and 2008, the US incarceration rate increased by roughly 400 percent. Trends in crime rates, arrest rates per crime committed, conviction rates per arrest, and expected time-served in prison given conviction all influence trends in incarceration rates. Available data do not allow researchers to precisely measure the contribution of each of these factors to the US prison boom. However, increases in expected prison time-served among those arrested for many different offenses were the most important drivers of rising incarceration rates. We argue that changes in policies that govern sentencing and parole are the likely drivers of these increases. We also discuss potential reforms that may reduce expected time-served among convicted offenders while minimizing harm to public safety.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/the-role-of-policy-in-prison-growth-and-decline/,2023-150,30-Nov-23,BFI,12/4/2023
Age and Suicide Impulsivity: Evidence from Handgun Purchase Delay Laws,"John J. Donohue, Samuel V. Cai, Arjun Ravi","We provide the first quasi-experimental estimates of variation in suicide impulsivity by age by examining the impact of firearm purchase delay laws by age. Prior studies of firearm purchase delay laws use traditional two-way-fixed-effects estimation, but we demonstrate that bias due to heterogenous treatment effects may have inflated previous estimates relative to our stacked-regression approach. We also develop a triple-difference stacked-regression estimator to confirm the robustness of our results. We find that purchase delay laws reduce firearm suicide for the overall adult population, but this effect is largely driven by a 6.1 percent reduction in firearm suicides for young adults ages 21-34. We demonstrate that the relationship between purchase delay laws and firearm suicide reduction weakens with age and is not driven by gun ownership rates. We argue that this is due to the impulsiveness of young adults in committing suicide, indicating that removing firearm access for young adults may provide a critical deterrent to suicide.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31917,31917,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Geoeconomic Fragmentation: What’s at Stake for the EU,"Chikako Baba, Ting Lan, Aiko Mineshima, Florian Misch, Magali Pinat, Asghar Shahmoradi, Jiaxiong Yao, Rachel   Elkan","Geoeconomic fragmentation (GEF) is becoming entrenched worldwide, and the European Union (EU) is not immune to its effects. This paper takes stock of GEF policies impinging on—and adopted by—the EU and considers how exposed the EU is through trade, financial and technological channels. Motivated by current policies adopted by other countries, the paper then simulates how various measures—raising costs of trade and technology transfer and fossil fuel prices, and imposition of sectoral subsidies—would affect the EU economy. Due to its high-degree of openness, the EU is found to be exposed to GEF through multiple channels, with simulated losses that differ significantly across scenarios. From a welfare perspective, this suggests the need for a cautious approach to GEF policies. The EU’s best defence against GEF is to strengthen the Single Market while advocating for a multilateral rules-based trading system.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/29/Geoeconomic-Fragmentation-Whats-at-Stake-for-the-EU-541864,WPIEA2023245,"Thu, 30 Nov 2023 ",IMF,12/4/2023

Empirically, a large fraction of the equity market risk premium is realized on a small number of trading days with significant macroeconomic announcements. We review the literature that demonstrates that the existence of the macroeconomic announcement premium implies that investors' preferences must satisfy generalized risk sensitivity. We show how this conclusion generalizes to environments with heterogeneous investors and demonstrate how incorporating generalized risk sensitivity affects economic analysis in dynamic setups with uncertainty.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31923,31923,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
The Intergenerational Effects of Parental Leave: Exploiting Forty Years of U.S. Policy Variation,"Andrea M. Flores, George-Levi Gayle, Andrés Hincapié","We study the effects of job-protected leave policies on intergenerational mobility, long-run child outcomes, and parental decisions (labor market, investments in children, and fertility). We merge rich sources of historical information on family leave policies across the United States since 1973 with over 40 years of survey data covering two generations of individuals. Exploiting variation in the timing of job-protected leave policies introduced in a large set of 18 states and the District of Columbia before the enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in 1993, we find that the pre-FMLA protected leave policies had a level effect and a mobility effect. The level effect yields from overall improvements in education and wages for the children born under these policies. The mobility effect, chiefly an increase in intergenerational mobility in education, stems from heterogeneity in the effects of the policies: children of mothers with fewer years of education benefit more. As a potential mechanism, we find that the policies increased mothers’ time investments in children and the likelihood of the households having childcare expenses. Finally, consistent with the tradeoffs of policy design, we find that the policies exacerbated the motherhood penalty in labor market outcomes and that they affected fertility choices, increasing the likelihood of having a first child and decreasing the likelihood of having subsequent children.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31911,31911,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Distributional Tax Analysis in Theory and Practice: Harberger Meets Diamond-Mirrlees,"Emmanuel Saez, Gabriel Zucman","This paper proposes a new framework to study the distribution of taxes and the effects of tax reforms, connecting classical tax incidence analysis to optimal tax theory. To study the distribution of current taxes, labor taxes are assigned to the corresponding workers, capital taxes to the corresponding asset owners, and consumption taxes to consumers. The tax rates are the wedges between pre-tax prices (relevant for production) and after-tax prices (relevant for the work, saving, and consumption decisions of households). In contrast to the conventional approach that shifts taxes across production factors, our approach measures actual incomes, is internally consistent, and maximizes the comparability of tax progressivity and inequality over time and across countries. Applying this methodology to the United States, we find that the effective tax rate of the top 1% has declined from about 50% in the early 1950s to 32% in 2021. It is through the corporate tax that a high degree of tax progressivity was achieved in the middle of the 20th century. To analyze the distributional effects of tax reforms, mechanical changes in tax liability by income groups and aggregate revenue effects due to household behavioral responses are sufficient statistics in neoclassical optimal tax models. The effects of taxes on pre-tax prices at the heart of classical tax incidence analysis are irrelevant. This neoclassical framework can be extended to incorporate non-standard behavioral responses uncovered by the recent empirical literature. We apply this framework by providing a distributional analysis of frequently discussed tax reforms, including replacing employer-provided health insurance contributions by a payroll tax.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31912,31912,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Climate Change Mitigation and Policy Spillovers in the EU’s Immediate Neighborhood,"Serhan Cevik, Nadeem Ilahi, Krzysztof Krogulski, Grace B Li, Sabiha Mohona, Yueshu Zhao","EU’s neighborhood countries (EUN) have lagged the EU on emissions mitigation; coal-heavy power generation and industrial sectors are a key factor. They have also trailed EU countries in emissions mitigation policies since 2000, with little use of market-based instruments, and they still have substantial fossil fuel subsidies. Increasingly stringent EU mitigation policies are asociated with lower emissions in EUN. Overall output effects of the CBAM, in its current form, would be limited, though exports and emissions-intensive industries could be heavily impacted. A unilaterally adopted economywide carbon tax of $75 per ton would significantly lower emissions by 2030, with minimal consequences for output or household welfare, though a safety net for the affected workers may be necessary. To become competitive today by attracting green FDI and technology, overcoming infrastructure constraints and integrating into EU’s supply chains, EUN countries would be well served to front load decarbonization, rather than postpone it for later.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/30/Climate-Change-Mitigation-and-Policy-Spillovers-in-the-EUs-Immediate-Neighborhood-541902,WPIEA2023246,"Fri, 01 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/4/2023

The Outlook for Women's Employment and Labor Force Participation,Stefania Albanesi,"Employment and participation rates for US prime age women rose steadily during the second half of the 20th century. In the last 30 years, however, those rates stagnated, even as employment and participation rates for women in other industrialized countries continued to rise. I discuss the role of changes in the earnings structure and persistent institutional barriers, such as limited investment in family policies, that may be holding back employment among American women today. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced employment more for women than for men and raised the barriers to female participation due to the increase in childcare responsibilities during this period. Yet, the diffusion of remote and hybrid work arrangements in its aftermath may be beneficial for women's participation in the long run, even if  both men's and women's post-pandemic employment growth so far are strongly associated with access to remote work options.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31916,31916,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023

A model is constructed under idealised conditions that presume the risks associated with artificial general intelligence (AGI) are real, that safe AGI products are possible, and that there exist socially-minded funders who are interested in funding safe AGI even if this does not maximise profits. It is demonstrated that a socially-minded entity formed by such funders would not be able to minimise harm from AGI that might be created by unrestricted products released by for-profit firms. The reason is that a socially-minded entity has neither the incentive nor ability to minimise the use of unrestricted AGI products in ex post competition with for-profit firms and cannot preempt the AGI developed by for-profit firms ex ante.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31924,31924,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Federal Reserve Structure and the Production of Monetary Policy Ideas,"Michael D. Bordo, Edward S. Prescott","We evaluate the decentralized structure of the Federal Reserve System as a mechanism for generating and processing new ideas on monetary policy over the 1960 - 2000 period. We document the introduction of monetarism, rational expectations, credibility, transparency, and other monetary policy ideas by Reserve Banks into the Federal Reserve System. We argue that the Reserve Banks were willing to support and develop new ideas due to internal reforms to the FOMC that Chairman William McChesney Martin implemented in the 1950s and the increased ties with academia that developed in this period. Furthermore, the Reserve Banks were able to succeed at this because of their private-public governance structure. We illustrate this with a time-consistency model in which a decentralized organization is better at producing new ideas than a centralized one. We argue that this role of the Reserve Banks is an important benefit of the Federal Reserve’s decentralized structure by allowing for more competition in formulating ideas and by reducing groupthink.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31915,31915,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023
Pre-LBO Credit Market Conditions and Post-LBO Target Behavior,Seung Kwak and Charles Press,"In the context of leveraged buyouts (LBOs), this paper empirically studies the relation between pre-buyout credit market conditions and the post-buyout behavior of target companies, employing a supervisory dataset to overcome limited data availability for post-buyout target financial information. We propose an LBO-specific measure of (changes of) credit market conditions--the short-term (6-month) change of credit spreads leading up to buyout close. Using this proposed measure, we show that loosening pre-LBO credit market conditions, which are related to higher buyout leverage consistent with the literature, are associated with poor post-LBO (operating) performance of the target company. These results support the narrative of agency costs of debt such as risk shifting and debt overhang but are inconsistent with theories of disciplinary effects of debt. We provide further evidence supportive of the theories of agency costs of debt and some results favorable to the risk shifting story.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/pre-LBO-credit-market-conditions-and-post-LBO-target-behavior.htm,2023-077,23-Dec,FED-BOARD,12/4/2023
Sovereign Debt and Credit Default Swaps (Revised November 2023),"Gaston Chaumont, Grey Gordon, Bruno Sultanum and Elliot  Tobin","How do credit default swaps (CDS) affect sovereign debt markets? We analyze how liquidity, exposure to default risk, and regulation affect the answer to this question using a sovereign debt model where investors trade bonds and CDS over the counter via directed search. Restricting portfolios can improve bond prices and bond-market activity, but the net effect depends on relative frictions in bond and CDS markets, the exposure of investors, and how the sovereign responds to the policy. Our novel identification strategy exploits confidential microdata to quantify trading frictions and the exposure distribution. The calibrated model generates realistic CDS-bond basis deviations, bid-ask spreads, and CDS volumes and positions. Our baseline specification predicts trading frictions and an inability to short sell bonds significantly improves sovereign debt prices, but policies that restrict CDS trading have small effects.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-05,23-05R,29-Nov-23,FED-RICHMOND,12/4/2023

We find that 90-day delinquencies were 4 percentage points higher and prepayments were 16 percentage points higher for properties that were damaged by wildfires compared to properties 1 to 2 miles outside of the wildfire perimeter, which suggests higher risks to mortgage markets than found in previous studies. We find no significant changes in delinquency or prepayment for undamaged properties inside a wildfire boundary. Prepayments are not driven by increased sales or refinances, suggesting insurance claims drive prepayment. Almost 40 percent of affected households receive insurance settlements lower than the estimated replacement costs that define coverage limits. This underpayment and the resulting deficits imply that households receive about $200,000 to $300,000 less than their entitled amount under California law.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-finance/mortgage-markets/california-wildfires-property-damage-and-mortgage-repayment,23-05,21-Nov-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,12/4/2023
How Much Are the Poor Losing From Tax Competition?,Mathilde Muñoz,"This paper quantifies the unequal welfare effects of tax competition. I derive the optimal tax and transfer schedules in a free mobility union composed of countries that can either compete or set a uniform federal tax rate. In the absence of fiscal coordination, governments internalize that any decentralized tax reform can lead to the out-migration of taxpayers at the top of the income distribution while increasing the in-migration of transfer recipients. As a result, the optimal level of redistribution is always lower in the tax competition equilibrium. Numerical calibrations show that being in a competition union rather than in a federal union decreases poorer individuals’ welfare by up to -20 percent. In contrast, the rich experience higher welfare in the tax competition equilibrium due to lower tax rates.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31920,31920,23-Dec,NBER,12/4/2023

"The World’s Rust Belts: The Heterogeneous Effects of Deindustrialization on 1,993 Cities in Six Countries","Luisa Gagliardi, Enrico Moretti, Michel Serafinelli","We investigate the employment consequences of deindustrialization for 1,993 cities in France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, and the United States. In all six countries we find a strong negative relationship between a city's share of manufacturing employment in the year of its country’s manufacturing peak and the subsequent change in total employment, reflecting the fact that cities where manufacturing was initially more important experienced larger negative labor demand shocks. But in a significant number of cases, total employment fully recovered and even exceeded initial levels, despite the loss of manufacturing jobs. Overall, 34% of former manufacturing hubs--defined as cities with an initial manufacturing employment share in the top tercile--experienced employment growth faster than their country's mean, suggesting that a surprisingly large number of cities was able to adapt to the negative shock caused by deindustrialization. The U.S. has the lowest share, indicating that the U.S. Rust Belt communities have fared relatively worse compared to their peers in the other countries. We then seek to understand why some former manufacturing hubs recovered while others didn't. We find that deindustrialization had different effects on local employment depending on the initial share of college-educated workers in the labor force. While in the two decades before the manufacturing peak, cities with a high college share experienced a rate of employment growth similar to those with a low college share, in the decades after the manufacturing peak, the employment trends diverged: cities with a high college share experienced significantly faster employment growth. The divergence grows over time at an accelerating rate. Using an instrumental variable based on the driving distance to historical colleges and universities, we estimate that a one standard deviation increase in local college share results in a rate of employment growth per decade that is 9.1 percentage points higher. This effect is in part explained by faster growth in human capital-intensive services, which more than offsets the loss of manufacturing jobs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31948,31948,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023

The analysis provides interesting insights into how fintech correlates with financial stability: (i) the impact magnitude and statistical significance of fintech depend on the type of instrument (digital lending vs. digital capital raising); (ii) the overall effect of all fintech instruments together turns out to be negative because of the overwhelming share of digital lending in total, albeit statistically insignificant; and (iii) while digital capital raising is estimated to have a positive effect on financial stability in advanced economies, its effect is negative in developing countries.

We use Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood regressions to estimate this expectation and generate our experimental measure of costs. An alternative calculation of depreciation and Net Domestic Product might be derived from the time series of costs incurred, rather than the far smoother expectation.

Gomes, Nishtha Sharma","This paper examines the impact of women’s legal rights on labor force participation decisions made by women and men through a granular analysis of 35 gendered laws. Building on previous literature, it departs from the analysis using aggregate indices due to concerns about (i) the usability of an index for policymaking purposes, (ii) the economic interpretation of an index’s average marginal effects, (iii) and the implicit assumption of homogeneous effects underlying regressions with an index. The findings identify nine key laws that can foster female labor force participation. Notably, laws related to household dynamics and women’s agency within the family, such as divorce and property rights laws, and laws regarding the ability of women to travel outside the home, are especially important in influencing their decision to work. The paper also shows that improving women’s legal rights does not improve their labor force participation through a substitution effect as it has no systematic negative effect on men’s labor force participation.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/08/Lawful-Progress-Unveiling-the-Laws-That-Reshape-Womens-Work-Decisions-542209,WPIEA2023252,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/11/2023

Neoclassical Growth in an Interdependent World,"Benny Kleinman, Ernest Liu, Stephen J. Redding, Motohiro Yogo","We generalize the closed-economy neoclassical growth model (CNGM) to allow for costly goods trade and capital flows with imperfect substitutability between countries. We develop a tractable, multi-country, quantitative model that matches key features of the observed data (e.g., gravity equations for trade and capital holdings) and is well suited for analyzing counterfactual policies that affect both goods and capital market integration (e.g., U.S.-China decoupling). We show that goods and capital market integration interact in non-trivial ways to shape impulse responses to counterfactual changes in productivity and goods and capital market frictions and the speed of convergence to steady-state.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31951,31951,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
On the Economics of Extinction and Mass Extinctions,"M. Scott Taylor, Rolf Weder","Human beings' domination of the planet has not been kind to many species worldwide. This is to be expected.  Humans have radically altered natural landscapes, harvested heavily from the ocean, and altered the climate in an unprecedented way. Recent concerns over the extent and rate of biodiversity loss have led to renewed interest in extinction outcomes and speculation concerning humans' potential role in any future mass extinction. In this paper, we discuss the economic causes of extinction in two high-profile cases - Sharks and the North American Buffalo -  and then extend our framework to allow for multiple species and the possibility of mass extinction. Throughout, we present evidence drawn from authoritative data sources with a focus on shark populations to ground our analysis. Despite large gaps in our data, the available evidence suggests extinction risks are rising for many species and policy is slow to react.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31952,31952,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Climate and Cross-Border Migration,"Paula Beltran, Metodij Hadzi-Vaskov","Our work is positioned at the intersection of migration and climate change—two key forces shaping the economic outlook of many countries. The analysis explores: (i) the relative importance of origincountry vs destination-country factors in explaining migration patterns; (ii) importance of climate disasters as driver of cross-border migration; and (iii) the importance of climate-driven migration on the overall impact of climate on macroeconomic outcomes. It arrives at the following main findings. First, both origin-country and destination-country contribute to explaining migration outflows from EMDEs, although only the global shocks seem important for advanced economies. Second, climate disasters are important for explaining the origincountry migration shocks in LICs and EMDEs, are especially relevant for smaller countries, and lead to migration of both genders, albeit relatively more for males out of LICs. Third, important portion of climate’s overall impact on economic outcomes—especially agricultural GDP, remittances, and inequality—is captured via climate-driven migration. Finally, higher investment in climate-resilient infrastructure can reduce the impact of climate on cross-border migration, and thereby, result in potentially important economic gains.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/08/Climate-and-Cross-Border-Migration-542196,WPIEA2023250,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/11/2023
Natural and Neutral Real Interest Rates: Past and Future,Maurice Obstfeld,"This paper surveys the decline in real interest rates in advanced and emerging economies over the past several decades, linking that process to a range of global factors that have operated with different force in different periods. The paper argues that estimates of long-run equilibrium real rates (r̄) may not always furnish an accurate guide to the rate appropriate for short-term monetary policy (r*). It argues further that effective monetary should consider not only equilibrium in the market for domestic goods, but also the current account balance, financial conditions (including capital flows), and imperfect policy credibility. Equilibrium long-term real interest rates have risen recently according to market indicators. However, the main underlying factors that have pushed real interest rates down since the 1980s and 1990s – notably demographic shifts, lower productivity growth, corporate market power, and safe asset demand relative to supply – do not appear poised to reverse strongly enough to drive a big and durable rise in global real interest rates over the coming years. Low equilibrium interest rates may well continue periodically to bedevil monetary policy and financial stability.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31949,31949,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Time Use and Macroeconomic Uncertainty,"Matteo Cacciatore, Daniela Hauser, Stefano Gnocchi","We study the effects of uncertainty on time use and their macroeconomic implications. Employing data from the American Time Use Survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we document that heightened uncertainty increases housework and reduces market work hours, mildly impacting leisure. We then propose a model that  quantitatively accounts for these estimates. We show that substitution between market and housework provides self-insurance to households, weakening precautionary savings. However, it also reduces aggregate demand, ultimately amplifying uncertainty's recessionary impact. Time reallocation can lead to higher inflation, particularly when uncertainty couples with policies redirecting time use towards housework (e.g., lockdown restrictions).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31954,31954,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
"Dollar Shortages, CIP Deviations, and the Safe Haven Role of the Dollar","Philippe Bacchetta, J. Scott Davis, Eric van Wincoop","Since 2007, an increase in risk or risk aversion has resulted in a US dollar appreciation and greater deviations from covered interest parity (CIP). In contrast, prior to 2007, risk had no impact on the dollar, and CIP held. To explain these phenomena, we develop a two-country model featuring (i) market segmentation, (ii) limited CIP arbitrage (since 2007), (iii) global dollar dominance. During periods of heightened global financial stress, dollar shortages in the offshore market emerge, leading to increased CIP deviations and a dollar appreciation.  The appreciation occurs even in the absence of global dollar demand shocks. Central bank swap lines  mitigate these effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31937,31937,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023

Influencing Policy and Transforming Institutions: Lessons from Kidney/Liver Exchange,"Tayfun Sönmez, M. Utku Ünver","Kidney exchange emerges as a pioneering application in the early stages of market design. In contrast to most other successful applications in the field, where design economists primarily serve as consultants to decision-makers, in the context of kidney exchange, they assumed the role of outsider critics, ultimately succeeding in shaping real-life practices and institutions. This paper delves into the strategies that facilitated this influential role. Drawing on our two-decade involvement in shaping kidney and liver exchange clearinghouses in the United States and Turkey, we provide insights into factors pivotal for the effectiveness of market design research in shaping policy. Building upon these experiences and incorporating lessons from school choice reforms in the 2000s, Sönmez (2023) introduces a novel institutional design paradigm termed ""minimalist market design."" Recent years have witnessed tangible outcomes resulting from integrated research and policy efforts employing this framework, notably contributing to the 2021 reform of the US Army's cadet branching system and the establishment of reserve systems during the Covid-19 pandemic for vaccine and therapy allocation across multiple states.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31941,31941,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Heterogeneous Impacts of Sentencing Decisions,"Andrew Jordan, Ezra Karger, Derek Neal","We examine 70,581 felony court cases filed in Chicago, IL, from 1990–2007. We exploit case randomization to assess the impact of judge assignment and sentencing decisions on the arrival of new charges. We find that, in marginal cases, incarceration creates large and lasting reductions in recidivism among first offenders. Yet, among marginal repeat offenders, incarceration creates only short-run incapacitation effects and no lasting reductions in the incidence of new felony charges. These treatment-impact differences inform ongoing legal debates concerning the merits of sentencing rules that recommend leniency for first offenders while encouraging or mandating incarceration sentences for many repeat offenders. We show that methods that fail to estimate separate outcome equations for first versus repeat offenders or fail to model judge-specific sentencing tendencies separately for cases involving first versus repeat offenders produce misleading results for first offenders.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31939,31939,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
How Far Has Globalization Gone? A Tale of Two Regions,"Rodolfo Campos, Samuel Pienknagura, Jacopo Timini","We study the evolution of trade globalization in a set of countries in Latin America (mostly the largest ones) and Asia over the past 25 years. Relying on structural gravity models, we first estimate a proxy of trade globalization that captures the ease of trading internationally with respect to trading domestically. Results indicate that the evolution of trade globalization since the mid-1990s has been similar between the two regions, but very heterogeneous within them. Trade globalization has been particularly strong in agriculture, mining and manufacturing, but has lagged in services. The paper also documents that trade globalization has been particularly strong in agriculture, mining and manufacturing, but it lagged in services. Within region heterogeneity is associated to a set of trade policy instruments, including tariffs, non-tariff measures, WTO membership. and trade agreements. Next, we quantify the economic implications of the estimated globalization trends. Simulations of a multi-sector trade model point to heterogeneous long-term impacts of globalization on GDP—some countries exhibiting substantial gains and others experiencing large losses—, with no single sector playing a preponderant role.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/08/How-Far-Has-Globalization-Gone-A-Tale-of-Two-Regions-542218,WPIEA2023255,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/11/2023

We find that the geopolitical shock affects the markets of wheat (3%) and European natural gas (12%). However, substantial heterogeneity is observed among the food and energy markets. Geopolitical risk affects the European natural gas market more strongly than the US and Asian markets. The regional segment of natural gas markets could explain this.

Many people associate Chicago’s views with Milton Friedman’s advocacy for flexible exchange rates. But, of course, there was much more than that, including the work of J. Laurence Laughlin on bimetallism, Jacob Viner on the balance of payments, Lloyd Metzler on transfers, Harry Johnson on trade and currencies, Lloyd Mints on exchange rate regimes, Robert Mundell on optimal currency areas, and Arnold Harberger on shadow exchange rates, among other.

An Empirical Analysis of the Interconnection Queue,"Sarah Johnston, Yifei Liu, Chenyu Yang","Generators applying to connect to the U.S. power grid go through an interconnection queue. Most wind and solar generators that begin the process do not complete it. Using new data, we find that a long queue increases the average waiting time, and high interconnection costs are a key factor in a generator’s decision to withdraw. We develop and estimate a dynamic model of the queue and quantify the effects of policy reforms. Our simulations indicate that reducing waiting times can significantly increase completions. An alternative queuing mechanism can therefore increase completed capacity by removing certain generators to reduce congestion. A flat entry fee has a similar effect. We also quantify the effects of reforming how interconnection costs are assessed. These policy reforms lead to a substantial reduction in carbon emissions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31946,31946,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Optimal Exchange Rate Policy,"Oleg Itskhoki, Dmitry Mukhin","We develop a general policy analysis framework for an open economy that features nominal rigidities and financial frictions giving rise to endogenous PPP and UIP deviations. The efficient allocation can be implemented with monetary policy closing the output gap and FX interventions eliminating UIP deviations. When the “natural” real exchange rate is stable, both goals can be achieved solely by monetary policy that fixes the exchange rate — an open-economy divine coincidence. More generally, optimal policy features a managed float/crawling peg complemented with FX forward guidance and macroprudential accumulation of FX reserves, in line with the “fear of floating” observed in the data. Capital controls are not necessary to achieve the frictionless allocation, but they facilitate the extraction of rents in the currency market. Constrained unilateral policies are not optimal from the global perspective, and international cooperation features a complementary use of FX interventions across countries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31933,31933,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Occupational Hazard?

Are birth outcomes of physician mothers affected as a result? Using Texas birth data from 2007-2014, we compared birth outcomes between physicians and another highly educated group, lawyers, and between surgeons and non-surgeon physicians. Further, using a difference-in-differences framework, we examine whether the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education 2011 duty hour reform, which lowered trainee work hours, impacted the birth outcomes of babies born to physicians compared with lawyers. We find that physicians have lower birth weights and shorter pregnancies than lawyers with the results driven by physicians in surgical specialties. However, the duty hour reform appears to not have impacted birth outcomes. Thus, we find that physicians tend to have worse birth outcomes than lawyers and, in this case, the work reform did little to address the difference.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31955,31955,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023

Global spillovers from multi-dimensional US monetary policy,"Georgios Georgiadis, Marek Jarociński","We estimate spillovers from US monetary policy for different measures in the Federal Reserve’s toolkit. We make use of novel measures of exogenous variation in conventional rate policy, forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) based on high-frequency asset-price surprises around Federal Open Market Committee meetings. The identification relies on relatively weak assumptions and accounts for the possible presence of residual endogenous components—such as central bank information effects—in these monetary policy surprises. We find that: (i) forward guidance and LSAPs trigger much larger spillovers than conventional rate policy; (ii) spillovers transmit predominantly through financial channels centering on global investors’ risk appetite and manifest in changes in equity prices, bond spreads, capital flows and the dollar exchange rate; (iii) LSAPs trigger immediate international portfolio re-balancing between US and advanced-economy bonds, but generally entail only rather limited term premium spillovers;(iv) both forward guidance and LSAPs entail trade-offs for emerging-market-economy central banks, either between stabilizing output and prices or between additionally ensuring financial stability in terms of capital inflows.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2881~a2c5c8070a.en.pdf?2b1e4e1086b6dab3280a0feba0de5e6e,2881,5-Dec-23,ECB,12/11/2023
Sovereign Default and Tax-smoothing in the Shadow of Corruption and Institutional Weakness,"Marina Azzimonti, Nirvana Mitra","Emerging countries exhibit volatile fiscal policies and frequent sovereign debt crises, that significantly diminish the well-being of their citizens. International advisors typically suggest developed-world solutions as a remedy. We argue that the root of the problem lies in the institutional environment, which does not incentivize responsible policymaking, particularly tax-smoothing practices. Focusing on democratic representation and control of corruption, our dynamic political-economy bargaining model shows that nations with weaker institutions experience frequent default episodes and greater economic volatility. Our results are in line with stylized facts from a panel of 58 countries between 1990 and 2022. Through counterfactual experiments, we find that while emerging economy policymakers might favor moderate reforms to improve democratic representation, achieving the institutional depth seen in developed countries is politically unfeasible, despite its clear advantages for citizens.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31943,31943,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Impacts of the Jones Act on U.S. Petroleum Markets,"Ryan Kellogg, Richard L.

We collect data on U.S. Gulf Coast and East Coast fuel prices, movements, and consumption, and we estimate domestic non-Jones shipping costs using freight rates for Gulf Coast exports. We then model counterfactual prices and product movements absent the Jones Act, allowing shippers to arbitrage price differences between the Gulf and East Coasts when they exceed transport costs. Eliminating the Jones Act would have reduced average East Coast gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel prices by $0.63, $0.80, and $0.82 per barrel, respectively, during 2018–2019, with the largest price decreases occurring in the Lower Atlantic.

The Labor Market Effects of Legal Restrictions on Worker Mobility,"Matthew S. Johnson, Kurt J.

Using newly-constructed panel data, we find that higher NCA enforceability diminishes workers’ earnings and job mobility, with larger effects among workers most likely to sign NCAs. These effects are far-reaching: changes in enforceability impose externalities on workers across state borders, suggesting that enforceability broadly affects labor market dynamism. We provide evidence that NCA enforceability primarily affects wages through its effect on workers' outside options; moreover, workers facing high enforceability are unable to leverage tight labor markets to increase earnings. We motivate these findings by embedding NCA enforceability in a search model with bargaining. Finally, higher NCA enforceability exacerbates gender and racial earnings gaps.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31929,31929,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023

We formulate a model of self-selection in which individuals select the compensation scheme with the largest expected valuation, which depends on individual- and scheme-specific beliefs and non-monetary preferences. We characterize the resulting sharp identified sets for individual-specific willingness-to-pay, subjective beliefs, and preferences, and develop conditions on the experimental design under which these identified sets are informative. We apply our methods to examine gender differences in preference for winner-take-all compensation schemes. We find that what has commonly been attributed to a gender difference in preference for performing in a competition is instead explained by men being more confident than women in their probability of winning a future (though not necessarily a past) competition.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31930,31930,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Fiscal Federalism and Monetary Unions,"Rafael Berriel, Eugenia Gonzalez-Aguado, Patrick J. Kehoe, Elena Pastorino","We apply ideas from fiscal federalism to reassess how fiscal authority should be delegated within a monetary union. In a real-economy model with fiscal externalities, in which local fiscal authorities have an informational advantage about the preferences of their citizens for public spending relative to a fiscal union, a decentralized regime is optimal for small federations of countries, whereas a centralized regime is optimal for large ones. We then consider a monetary-economy model, in which governments finance their expenditures with nominal debt, and inflation has a negative impact on aggregate productivity. When the monetary authority lacks commitment, the resulting time inconsistency problem generates an indirect endogenous fiscal externality. When a country-level fiscal authority chooses a higher level of nominal debt, it induces the monetary authority to inflate more to reduce the level of distortionary taxes needed to finance the higher debt. The resulting fiscal externality naturally becomes more severe as the number of countries in the monetary union increases. Here also a decentralized fiscal regime is optimal for small monetary unions, whereas a fiscal union is optimal for sufficiently large ones. Our key result is that as the size of a monetary union increases, it becomes relatively more desirable to centralize fiscal authority.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31953,31953,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023
Inflation and fiscal policy: is there a threshold effect in the fiscal reaction function?,"Clémence Briodeau, Cristina Checherita-Westphal","This paper estimates a fiscal reaction function (FRF) framework for euro area countries to test for the impact of changes in inflation on fiscal policy. We find evidence of non-linear short-term effects of HICP inflation on the primary balance after controlling for other relevant factors. Over the period 1999-2022, we unveil an inverse U-turn relationship and an inflation turning point - beyond which its short-term (contemporaneous) impact on the primary balance starts being negative - at somewhat above 4% for the sample of mature euro area economies (EA-12, first twelve EA members) and around 6% for the whole sample of euro area countries in 2022 (EA-19). Using an alternative measure of “inflation surprise” (available for the period 2003-2022) yields robust results in the larger EA-19 sample and lowers the threshold to just below 5%. In terms of channels, the non-linear effects are found to propagate through both the primary expenditure and the revenue ratio (more robustly through the former) in the EA-12 sample, while only the combined effect on the primary balance seems to prevail for EA-19. These results reflect primarily the most recent high inflation episode and indicate that in such conditions inflation can be costly for public finance flows even in the shorter run.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2880~c8663668e0.en.pdf?473a4c18ea0fee5b18b1e9b101f042b7,2880,5-Dec-23,ECB,12/11/2023

We show that a tax on inflation policy (TIP), which would require firms to pay a tax proportional to the increase in their prices, would effectively correct externalities in firms’ pricing decisions, tackle excessive inflation and reduce output volatility, without exacerbating price distortions. While proposals from the 1970s saw TIP as a substitute to MP, we find that it is a complement, with TIP addressing markups and inflation expectation shocks, and MP addressing demand shocks.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/08/Optimal-Taxation-of-Inflation-542215,WPIEA2023254,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/11/2023

We implement a field experiment in Qatar, where residential customers have some of the highest energy use per capita in the world. Our dataset consists of 207,325 monthly electricity meter readings from a panel of 6,096 customers. We employ two normative treatments priming identity - a religious message quoting the Qur’an, and a national message reminding households that Qatar prioritizes energy conservation. The treatments reduce electricity use by 3.8% and both messages are equally effective.

Updating about Yourself by Learning about the Market: The Dynamics of Beliefs and Expectations in Job Search,"Qiwei He, Philipp Kircher","This study documents how job seekers update perceived job-finding prospects by unemployment duration and by learning about aggregate unemployment. We find that job seekers perceive an 18% decline in their job-finding probability for each additional month of unemployment, but perceive a higher job-finding probability when the aggregate unemployment rate is unexpectedly low. We develop a job search model with learning and updating to quantify the impact of perceived aggregate unemployment on subjective job-finding probabilities, revealing an overreaction to news about aggregate conditions.

Revisiting the Eswaran-Kotwal Model of Tenancy,"Maitreesh Ghatak, Dilip Mookherjee","Persistence of sharecropping  tenancy and increases in farm productivity following regulations protecting tenant rights have been observed in many developing  countries. This paper examines if these can be explained by alternative models of sharecropping with two sided efforts/investments, namely, complete contract models either without wealth constraints (Eswaran-Kotwal (1985)), or with a wealth constrained tenant (Mookherjee (1997), Banerjee-Gertler-Ghatak (2002)); and incomplete contract holdup models without wealth constraints (Grossman-Hart (1986)). In the absence of wealth constraints the complete contract model always results in (incentive constrained) surplus-maximizing productivity, so there can be no scope for tenancy regulations to raise productivity. In the incomplete contract model, tenancy regulations would raise productivity only if the tenant's investments are more important than the landlord's investment. But in that case sharecropping tenancy would not persist in the absence of wealth constraints as the tenant would have purchased the land right ex ante from the landlord. The model with wealth constraints helps explain both the persistence of tenancy and productivity/surplus enhancing effects of tenancy regulations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31932,31932,23-Dec,NBER,12/11/2023

"Feeling Rich, Feeling Poor: Housing Wealth Effects and Consumption in Europe","Serhan Cevik, Sadhna Naik","Households across Europe are struggling with a double crisis—the worst inflation shock since the World War II and a sudden correction in house prices. There is a rich literature on how housing price cycles affect consumer spending, finding mixed results with a wide range of consumption responses to changes in housing wealth. In this paper, using quarterly data on 20 countries in Europe over the period 1980–2023, we analyze the dynamic relationship between inflation-adjusted housing wealth and consumer spending and obtain statistically significant and economically intuitive results. Household consumption responds positively and swiftly to changes in real house prices and gross disposable income as expected. Using the estimated coefficients, we can deduce that the average quarter-on-quarter decline of -1.96 percent in real house prices in the first quarter of 2023 in Europe could dampen consumer spending by about -0.51 percentage points in real terms on a cumulative basis over a horizon of eight quarters.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/08/Feeling-Rich-Feeling-Poor-Housing-Wealth-Effects-and-Consumption-in-Europe-542221,WPIEA2023256,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/11/2023

We show analytically and quantitatively that the canonical heterogeneous-agent model cannot replicate the proper ranking and magnitudes of these four tails simultaneously. Mechanisms addressing the wealth concentration puzzle in these models through return heterogeneity lead to a mirror consumption concentration puzzle. We match the cross-sectional data on these four Pareto tails by positing a combination of non-homothetic, wealth-dependent preferences and scale-dependent returns to capital. We underscore the importance of these results by showing that all four dimensions of top inequality jointly determine the long-run elasticity that governs the revenue-maximizing capital tax rate.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2023/2023-43,2023-43,23-Dec,FED-CHICAGO,12/18/2023

Toxified to the Bone: Early-Life and Childhood Exposure to Lead and Men’s Old-Age Mortality,"Jason Fletcher, Hamid Noghanibehambari","Several strands of research document the life-cycle impacts of lead exposure during the critical period of children’s development. Yet little is known about long-run effects of lead exposure during early-life on old-age mortality outcomes. This study exploits the staggered installation of water systems across 761 cities in the US over the first decades of the 20th century combined with cross-city differences in materials used in water pipelines to identify lead and non-lead cities. An event-study analysis suggests that the impacts are more concentrated on children exposed during in-utero up to age 10. The results of difference-in-difference analysis suggests an intent-to-treat effect of 2.7 months reduction in old-age longevity for fully exposed cohorts. A heterogeneity analysis reveals effects that are 3.5 and 2 times larger among the nonwhite subpopulation and low socioeconomic status families, respectively. We also find reductions in education and socioeconomic standing during early adulthood as candidate mechanism.

Closing the Productivity Gap with the US: Causes and Consequences of the Productivity Program in Western Europe,Michela Giorcelli,"This paper studies to what extent the transfer of US managerial technologies to Europe after World War II contributed to closing the gap with US businesses. Between 1952 and 1958, the US government sponsored the Productivity Program, which promoted management training trips for European managers at US firms. Through the analysis of reports compiled by UK, France, Germany, and Italian participating firms, I first document that these companies claimed between 5 and 10% yearly productivity increase thanks to the program. The fact that European businesses were not forced to adopt the American management model, but could adapt it to their firm needs and existing business practices was a key aspect of the program’s success. Second, using data on US and Italian participating firms’ performance I show that Italian firms grew on average 7.8 percent faster than that of US companies in the ten years after the start of the program. Moreover, the distribution of productivity of Italian and US firms became more similar over years, confirming a performance convergence between these companies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31959,31959,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023
The Effects of Social Security Incentives on Retirement in Spain,"Pilar García-Gómez, Silvia Garcia-Mandicó, Sergi Jimenez-Martin, Judit Vall Castelló","In this paper, we analyze the extent to what financial incentives have influenced individual and couples retirement decisions over the last two decades in Spain. We use administrative data on earnings histories to create synthetic measures of financial incentives that we link to individual survey data from the European Community Household Panel and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. The ocurrence of several major reforms in the period largely facilitates identification. We find that retirement is highly responsive to incentive variables (both ITAX and SSW). We find that a 10% change in the implicit tax rate on working longer increases the probability of retiring by about 0.70 pp (0.90 pp for men and 0.54 for women). Furthermore, we find that couple incentives matter more in husband's retirement decisions than in wife's retirement decisions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31956,31956,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023
The TCJA and Domestic Corporate Tax Rates,"Christine L.

While existing research has focused primarily on publicly traded companies, data limitations have prevented more holistic analyses of the corporate sector. Using a representative sample of U.S. corporate tax returns, we highlight how trends in effective tax rates (ETRs) and exposure to the legislation's main provisions varied for public, private, multinational, domestic, and large versus small firms. We document several novel facts, including that ETRs increased on average for privately held, domestic firms and for firms in the bottom 90% of the firm sales distribution after TCJA. In contrast, public, multinational, and large firms saw substantial ETR cuts on average. We find that firms' pre-TCJA exposure to changes in the corporate tax rate and treatment of net operating losses have the strongest correlation with post-TCJA ETR changes. Overall, the analysis underscores the divergent impacts of TCJA on different firm types and illuminates the economic scope and relative significance of TCJA's myriad provisions.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-tcja-and-domestic-corporate-tax-rates.htm,2023-078,23-Dec,FED-BOARD,12/18/2023

"Monetary Tightening, Commercial Real Estate Distress, and US Bank Fragility","Erica Xuewei Jiang, Gregor Matvos, Tomasz Piskorski, Amit Seru","Building on the work of Jiang et al. (2023) we develop a framework to analyze the effects of credit risk on the solvency of U.S. banks in the rising interest rate environment. We focus on commercial real estate (CRE) loans that account for about quarter of assets for an average bank and about $2.7 trillion of bank assets in the aggregate. Using loan-level data we find that after recent declines in property values following higher interest rates and adoption of hybrid working patterns about 14% of all loans and 44% of office loans appear to be in a “negative equity” where their current property values are less than the outstanding loan balances. Additionally, around one-third of all loans and the majority of office loans may encounter substantial cash flow problems and refinancing challenges. A 10% (20%) default rate on CRE loans – a range close to what one saw in the Great Recession on the lower end -- would result in about $80 ($160) billion of additional bank losses. If CRE loan distress would manifest itself early in 2022 when interest rates were low, not a single bank would fail, even under our most pessimistic scenario. However, after more than $2 trillion decline in banks’ asset values following the monetary tightening of 2022, additional 231 (482) banks with aggregate assets of $1 trillion ($1.4 trillion) would have their marked to market value of assets below the face value of all their non-equity liabilities. To assess the risk of solvency bank runs induced by higher rates and credit losses, we expand the Uninsured Depositors Run Risk (UDRR) financial stability measure developed by Jiang et al. (2023) where we incorporate the impact of credit losses into the market-to-market asset calculation, along with the effects of higher interest rates. Our analysis, reflecting market conditions up to 2023:Q3, reveals that CRE distress can induce anywhere from dozens to over 300 mainly smaller regional banks joining the ranks of banks at risk of solvency runs. These findings carry significant implications for financial regulation, risk supervision, and the transmission of monetary policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31970,31970,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023
Do Firms Mitigate Climate Impact on Employment? Evidence from US Heat Shocks,"Viral V.

Using establishment-level data, we show that firms operating in multiple counties in the United States respond to heat shocks by reducing employment in the affected locations and increasing it in unaffected locations, whereas single-location firms simply downsize. Workforce reallocation, aimed at preventing heat-related decline in labor productivity, is stronger among larger, financially stable firms with more ESG-oriented investors. The scale of this response increases with the severity of climate disasters and is aided by credit availability and competitive labor markets. Climate risk management by firms mitigates the impact of heat shocks on aggregate employment but induces a spatial redistribution of economic activity.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31967,31967,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023
Fiscal Impacts of Climate Disasters in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies,"Habtamu Fuje, Jiaxiong Yao, Seung Mo Choi, Hamza Mighri","Climate-induced disasters are causing increasingly frequent and intense economic damages, disproportionally affecting emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) relative to advanced economies (AEs). However, the impact of various types of climate shocks on output growth and fiscal positions of EMDEs is not fully understood. This research analyzes the macro-fiscal implications of three common climate disasters (droughts, storms, and floods) using a combination of macroeconomic data and comprehensive ground and satellite disaster indicators spanning the past three decades across 164 countries. Across EMDEs, where agriculture tends to be the principal sector, a drought reduces output growth by 1.4 percentage points and government revenue by 0.7 percent of GDP as it erodes the tax bases of affected countries. Meanwhile, likely reflecting limited fiscal space to respond to a disaster, fiscal expenditure does not increase following a drought. A storm drags output growth in EMDEs, albeit with negligible impact on fiscal revenue, but government expenditure increases due to reconstruction and clean-up efforts. We find only limited impact of localized floods on growth and fiscal positions. In contrast, AEs tend to experience negligible growth and fiscal consequences from climate-induced shocks. As these shocks have much more detrimental effects in EMDEs, international support for disaster preparedness and climate change adaptation play a crucial role for these countries to confront climate change. While the standard textbook result suggest that monetary policy is much more effective than fiscal policy in battling inflation in open economies due to the exchange rate channel, we show that a tigher fiscal stance is notably more effective in the current situation. This is so because when many countries currently need to tighten the policy stance simultanously, the exchange rate channel does not provide monetary policy with an edge over fiscal policy. We also show that fiscal consolidation can be helpful in small open emerging markets and developming economies by reaffirming their commitment to price stability, and by putting the fiscal house in order which reduces risk premiums and strenghtens the currency. Furthermore, we show that spillovers from major economies can be more adverse from tigher monetary policy. By applying a two-agent New Keynesian modelling framework with unconstrained and hand-to-mouth households, we show that any adverse effects of tighter fiscal policy (relative to tighter monetary policy) on consumption inequality can be handled with a combination of general spending cuts and targeted transfers to vulnerable households.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/15/Fiscal-Impacts-of-Climate-Disasters-in-Emerging-Markets-and-Developing-Economies-542408,WPIEA2023261,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/18/2023

In this paper, we estimate the effects of the regularization on fertility rates using two alternative difference-in-differences strategies that compare fertility behavior of “eligible” and “non-eligible” candidate women to obtain the legal status, both on aggregate and at the local level. Our findings suggests that gaining work permits leads to a significant increase in women fertility.

In OECD, large immigration waves raise domestic output and productivity in both the short and the medium term, pointing to significant dynamic gains for the host economy. We find no evidence of negative effects on aggregate employment of the native-born population. In contrast, our analysis of large refugee flows into emerging and developing countries does not find clear evidence of macroeconomic effects on the host country, a conclusion in line with a growing body of evidence that refugee immigrants are at disadvantage compared to other type of immigrants.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/14/The-Macroeconomic-Effects-of-Large-Immigration-Waves-542526,WPIEA2023259,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/18/2023

Inflation Dynamics in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): What is the Role of External Factors?,"Fozan Fareed, Abolfazl Rezghi, Charlotte Sandoz","Inflationary pressures have intensified in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 2021-2022, mainly driven by a pick-up in tradeable goods inflation. Despite this increase, inflation remained relatively contained as compared to regional comparators. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of inflation dynamics in the region, with a focus on external factors because of GCC’s high reliance on international trade. Using a Global Vector Autoregressive model with quarterly data from 1987 to 2022, we find that external factors such as the imported inflation from main trading partners, mainly driven by China, and nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) are the main drivers of inflation in the GCC region. Additionally, we find that the direct pass-through of international commodity price shocks such as oil and raw agricultural materials is somewhat limited, after controlling for trading partners’ inflation, which can be explained by the prevalence of subsidies and administered prices in the region. Overall, since external factors are the main drivers of domestic inflation in the GCC, an increased focus on diversification, promoting food security, and ensuring prudent central bank policies, including through effective liquidity management frameworks, can play a key role in managing this impact.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/15/Inflation-Dynamics-in-the-Gulf-Cooperation-Council-GCC-What-is-the-Role-of-External-Factors-542414,WPIEA2023263,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/18/2023
Experiments about Institutions,"Michael Callen, Jonathan L. Weigel, Noam Yuchtman","We review an emerging experimental literature studying institutional change. Institutions are a key determinant of economic growth, but the “critical junctures” in which institutions can change are not precisely defined. For example, such junctures are often identified ex post, raising methodological problems: selection on the outcome of institutional change; an inability to study beliefs, central to coordination and thus the process of institutional change; and an in- ability to conduct experiments to identify causal effects. We argue that critical junctures are identifiable in real-time as moments when there exists deep uncertainty about future institutions. Consistent with this conception, the papers reviewed: (i) examine changes to institutions, i.e., the “fundamental rules of the game”; (ii) are real-time studies of plausible critical junctures; and, (iii) use field experiments to achieve causal identification. Substantively, this literature examines institutional changes in state capacity and legitimacy, political inclusion, and political accountability. We also advocate more systematic measurement of beliefs about future institutions to identify critical junctures as they happen and provide an empirical proof of concept. Such work is urgent given contemporary critical junctures arising from democratic backsliding, state fragility, climate change, and conflicts over the rights of the marginalized.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31964,31964,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023
Debtor Income Manipulation in Consumer Credit Contracts,"Slava Mikhed, Sahil Raina, Barry Scholnick, Man Zhang","A previous version of this paper was originally published as Debtor Fraud in Consumer Debt Renegotiation in October 2022. Exploiting a policy change that required insolvent debtors to increase debt repayments at an arbitrary income cutoff, we document that some debtors reduce reported income to just below this cutoff to avoid the higher repayment. Those debtors who manipulate income have a lower probability of default on their repayment plans, consistent with having access to hidden income. We estimate this strategic manipulation costs creditors 12% to 36% of their total payout per filing.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-finance/consumer-credit/debtor-fraud-in-consumer-debt-renegotiation,22-35,7-Dec-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,12/18/2023
Accessing the Safety Net: How Medicaid Affects Health and Recidivism,"Analisa Packham, David Slusky","We estimate the causal impact of access to means-tested public health insurance coverage (Medicaid) on health outcomes and recidivism for those recently released from incarceration. To do so, we leverage a policy change in South Carolina that allowed simplified Medicaid re-enrollment for previously incarcerated eligible individuals. Using linked administrative data on criminal convictions and health insurance claims, we find that reducing barriers in access to Medicaid for vulnerable populations increases enrollment and utilization of health care services. However, we do not find that this improved health care insurance access reduces 1-year or 3-year recidivism, suggesting that effectiveness of such policies is context dependent.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31971,31971,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023

The Cost of Climate Policy to Capital: Evidence from Renewable Portfolio Standards,"Harrison Hong, Jeffrey D. Kubik, Edward P. Shore","Many US states have set ambitious renewable portfolio standards (RPS) that require utilities to switch from fossil fuels toward renewables. RPS increases the renewables capacity, bond issuance, maturity, and yield spreads of investor-owned utilities compared to municipal producers that are exempted from this climate policy. Contrary to stranded-asset concerns, the hit to overall firm financial health is moderate. Falling cost of renewables and passthrough of these costs to consumers mitigate the burden of RPS on firms. Using a Tobin’s q model, we show that, absent these mitigating factors, the impact of RPS on firm valuations would have been severe.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31960,31960,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023
Financial contagion within the interbank network,"Christina D. Mikropoulou, Angelos T. Vouldis","The analysis of contagion in financial networks has primarily focused on transmission channels operating through direct linkages. This paper develops a model of financial contagion in the interbank market featuring both direct and indirect transmission mechanisms. The model is used to analyse how shocks originating from outside sectors impact the functioning of the interbank market and investigates the emergence of instability in this setting. We conduct simulations on actual interbank bilateral exposures, constructed manually from a supervisory dataset reported by the largest euro area banks. We find that while the impact of direct contagion increases gradually with the shock intensity, the effect of indirect contagion is subject to threshold effects and can increase abruptly when the threshold is exceeded. In addition, the risk posed by indirect contagion has a higher upper bound compared to direct contagion. Finally, we find that in terms of overall impact, the shocks to the value of sovereign debt and non-bank financial institutions represent the most significant risk to the functioning of the interbank market.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2883~47e3ebe468.en.pdf?20be3ab47f51e49196debcf9f2e90488,2883,18-Dec-23,ECB,12/18/2023
"Dollar Shortages, CIP Deviations and the Safe Haven Role of the Dollar","Philippe Bacchetta, J.

Societal Aging and its Impact on Singapore,"Cynthia Chen, Julian Lim, Abhijit Visaria, Angelique Chan","Societal aging is arguably one of our most critical demographic challenges, and Singapore is aging at a much faster rate compared to other countries. Population aging could negatively affect older adults, contribute to an increase in healthcare expenditure and increase caregivers' financial and emotional burden. This chapter provides an overview of the well-being and health and social care needs of older adults in Singapore. Formulating social and public policies that enhance the health span, extend productive life years, support caregivers, and improve community health and social care services are crucial elements to help older adults age successfully. We analyze how aging affects health, financial security, and well-being, exploring correlations between disability levels and these factors.

How the Brady Plan Delivered on Debt Relief: Lessons and Implications,"Neil Shenai, Marijn A. Bolhuis","Rising debt vulnerabilities in low- and middle-income countries have rekindled interest in a Brady Plan-style mechanism to facilitate debt restructurings. To inform this debate, this paper analyzes the impact of the original Brady Plan by comparing macroeconomic outcomes of 10 Brady countries to 40 other emerging markets and developing economies. The paper finds that following the first Brady restructuring in 1990, Brady countries experienced substantial declines in public and external debt burdens and a sharp pick-up in output and productivity growth, anchored by a comparatively strong structural reform effort. The impact of the Brady Plan on overall debt burdens was many times greater than initial face value reductions, indicating the existence of a “Brady multiplier.” Brady restructurings took longer to complete than non-Brady restructurings. Today, similar mechanisms could be helpful in delivering meaningful debt stock reduction when solvency challenges are acute, but Brady-style mechanisms alone would not solve existing challenges in the sovereign debt landscape, including those related to creditor coordination, domestic barriers to economic reforms, and the increased prevalence of domestic debt, among others.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/14/How-the-Brady-Plan-Delivered-on-Debt-Relief-Lessons-and-Implications-542389,WPIEA2023258,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/18/2023
Household Debt and Borrower-Based Measures in Finland: Insights from a Heterogeneous Agent Model,Fumitaka Nakamura,"We analyze the effects of borrower-based macroprudential tools in Finland. To evaluate the efficiency of the tools, we construct a heterogeneous agent model in which households endogenously determine their housing size and liquid asset levels under two types of borrowing constraints: (i) a loan-to-value (LTV) limit and (ii) a debt-to-income (DTI) limit. When an unexpected negative income shock hits the economy, we find that a larger and more persistent drop in consumption is observed under the LTV limit compared to the DTI limit. Our results indicate that although DTI caps tend to be unpopular with lower income households because they limit the amount they can borrow, DTI caps are beneficial even on distributional grounds in stabilizing consumption. Specifically, DTI caps mitigate the consumption decline in recessions by restricting high leverage, and thus, they can usefully complement LTV caps.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/15/Household-Debt-and-Borrower-Based-Measures-in-Finland-Insights-from-a-Heterogeneous-Agent-542425,WPIEA2023262,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/18/2023
"Inflation, War Bonds, and the Rise of Republicans in the 1950s","Gillian Brunet, Eric Hilt, Matthew S. Jaremski","We study the role of war bonds and inflation in the presidential elections of the 1950s. During World War II, the federal government conducted aggressive campaigns to convince Americans to invest their savings in wartime savings bonds. Although the bonds were nonnegotiable and protected from interest rate fluctuations, two major inflationary episodes after the war, in 1946-48 and 1950-51, eroded the real value of their returns, contributing to a political backlash against the incumbent Democrats. In a difference-in-differences framework, we find that counties with higher war bond purchases shifted their votes towards the Republican party in the postwar elections, relative to the elections of the late 1930s and early 1940s. To address concerns related to the endogeneity of war bond purchases, we instrument for WWII bond subscriptions using participation rates from the World War I liberty bonds, and find similar results. Our results indicate that the promotion of savings bonds made Americans more sensitive to the high inflation that prevailed after the war, contributing to Republicans’ victories in the 1950s.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31969,31969,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023

Using US administrative data on worker earnings, we show that increases in risk premia lead to lower earnings for low-wage workers; these declines are primarily driven by job separations. By contrast, productivity shocks affect the earnings mainly of highly paid workers. We build an equilibrium model of labor market search that quantitatively replicates these facts. The model generates endogenous time-varying income risk in response to changes in risk premia and matches several stylized features of the data regarding unemployment and income risk over the business cycle.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31968,31968,23-Dec,NBER,12/18/2023

What Do Lead Banks Learn from Leveraged Loan Investors?,"Max Bruche, Ralf Meisenzahl, David Xiaoyu Xu","In leveraged loan deals, lead banks use bookbuilding to extract price-relevant information from syndicate participants. This paper examines the content of such information. We find that pricing adjustments during bookbuilding are highly informative, not only about investors’ required risk premium but also about borrower quality. A one-percentage-point increase in loan spread predicts a 0.8% higher excess return, a proxy for risk premium, over the first 3 months of secondary market trading. More importantly, it also predicts a 3% higher probability of subsequent default, implying that investors have private information about borrower quality that is unknown to the lead bank.

Low Risk Sharing with Many Assets,"Emile A. Marin, Sanjay R.

However, cross-border trade in one domestic and one foreign-currency-denominated risk-free asset prohibits these mechanisms from breaking the pattern consistent with complete markets. In this paper, we characterize how goods markets drive exchange rate cyclicality, taking into account trade in risk-free and/or risky assets. We show that goods-market mechanisms come back into play, even when there is cross-border trade in two risk-free assets, as long as we allow for empirically plausible heterogeneity in the stochastic discount factors of domestic marginal investors.",https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/working-papers/2023/37/,2023-37,11/1/2023,FED-SANFRANCISCO,12/21/2023
"Forecasting Core Inflation and Its Goods, Housing, and Supercore Components","Todd E. Clark, Matthew V. Gordon, Saeed Zaman","This paper examines the forecasting efficacy and implications of the recently popular breakdown of core inflation into three components: goods excluding food and energy, services excluding energy and housing, and housing. A comprehensive historical evaluation of the accuracy of point and density forecasts from a range of models and approaches shows that a BVAR with stochastic volatility in aggregate core inflation, its three components, and wage growth is an effective tool for forecasting inflation's components as well as aggregate core inflation. Looking ahead, the model's baseline projection puts core inflation at 2.6 percent in 2026, well below its 2023 level but still elevated relative to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective. The probability that core inflation will return to 2 percent or less is much higher when conditioning on goods or non-housing services inflation slowing to pre-pandemic levels than when conditioning on these components remaining above the same thresholds. Scenario analysis indicates that slower wage growth will likely be associated with reduced inflation in all three components, especially goods and non-housing services, helping to return core inflation to near the 2 percent target by 2026.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2334-forecasting-core-inflation-and-its-components,23-34,12.20.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,12/21/2023
Tax Heterogeneity and Misallocation,"Barış Kaymak, Immo Schott","Companies face different effective marginal tax rates on their income.

How Important Is the Information Effect of Monetary Policy?,"Zhao Han, Chengcheng Jia","Is the ""information effect"" of monetary policy quantitatively important? We first use a simple model to show that under asymmetric information, monetary policy surprises are correlated with the unobserved state of the economy. This correlation implies that monetary policy surprises provide information about the state of the economy, and at the same time, explains why the estimation of the information effect may be biased. We then develop a New Keynesian DSGE model under asymmetric information and calibrate model parameters to match macroeconomic dynamics in the US and forecasting accuracy in the Greenbook. Under our calibration, both the central bank and the private sector initially have noisy information.

A Narrative Analysis of Federal Appropriations for Research and Development,Andrew J.

We build a novel dataset quantifying the enacted full-year appropriations for all budgetary accounts funding R&D activities at these five agencies over fiscal years 1947-2019. We use this dataset to isolate a subset of 218 “significant” changes in real appropriations for each agency, and we analyze numerous primary and secondary sources to understand the context and motivation. Based on these sources, we classify each significant change in federal R&D appropriations as either “endogenous” or “exogenous” to short-run macroeconomic developments.

Market Design for the Environment,"Estelle Cantillon, Aurélie Slechten","The main argument in favor of markets in environmental contexts is the same as in other contexts: their ability to promote efficient allocations and production. But environmental problems bring their own challenges: their underlying bio-physical processes - and the technologies to monitor them - constrain what is feasible or even desirable. This chapter illustrates the main design dimensions in environmental markets, the trade-offs involved and their impact on performance, through the lens of a regulated market for pollution rights (the EU emissions trading scheme) and a voluntary market for the provision of environmental services (the global market for carbon credits). While both markets eventually contribute to climate change mitigation, their organisation as a “pollution market”, for the former, and as a “provision market”, for second, means that different design considerations take precedence. Both markets also face challenges: volatile prices in the EU emissions scheme and low trust for voluntary carbon markets.

Non-traded Gains From Trade - Selection in the Non-Traded Sector: Evidence from Brazil,"Rafael Machado Parente, Rowan Shi","We investigate how trade shocks affect the allocation of labor across plants at the local labor market level. Using Brazil’s import liberalization as a quasi-natural experiment, we uncover a new margin for the gains from trade: the reallocation of labor from smaller to larger producers in the non-traded sector. We find that in response to liberalization, larger non-traded producers self-select into importing, expanding as they gain access to inputs from abroad. We then develop a parsimonious model of heterogeneous producers incorporating this mechanism. The theory is consistent with the empirical findings and show that reallocation among non-traded producers is welfare-enhancing. In contrast, this reallocation effect disappears when all nontraded producers make the same importing decision.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/22/Non-traded-Gains-From-Trade-Selection-in-the-Non-Traded-Sector-Evidence-from-Brazil-542411,WPIEA2023265,"Fri, 22 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/28/2023
Long-run Impacts of Forced Labor Migration on Fertility Behaviors: Evidence from Colonial West Africa,"Pascaline Dupas, Camille Falezan, Marie Christelle Mabeu, Pauline Rossi","Is the persistently high fertility in West Africa today rooted in the decades of forced labor migration under colonial rule? We study the case of Burkina Faso, considered the largest labor reservoir in West Africa by the French colonial authorities. Hundreds of thousands of young men were forcibly recruited and sent to work in neighboring colonies for multiple years. The practice started in the late 1910s and lasted until the late 1940s, when forced labor was replaced with voluntary wage employment. We digitize historical maps, combine data from multiple surveys, and exploit the historical, temporary partition of colonial Burkina Faso (and, more specifically, the historical land of the Mossi ethnic group) into three zones with different needs for labor to implement a spatial regression discontinuity design analysis. We find that, on the side where Mossi villages were more exposed to forced labor historically, there is more temporary male migration to Côte d'Ivoire up to today, and lower realized and desired fertility today. We show evidence suggesting that the inherited pattern of low-skill circular migration for adult men reduced the reliance on subsistence farming and the accompanying need for child labor. We can rule out women's empowerment or improvements in human and physical capital as pathways for the fertility decline. These findings contribute to the debate on the origins of family institutions and preferences, often mentioned to explain West Africa's exceptional fertility trends, showing that fertility choices respond to changes in modes of production.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31993,31993,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023

Creating the “American Way” of Business: Evidence from WWII in the U.S.,Michela Giorcelli,"The Second World War II (WWII) was arguably one of the largest shocks to the U.S. economic and production system in history. Historians, business historians, and economists have largely discussed the stimulus that WWII had on U.S. technological advancements. However, its effect on U.S. ‘‘managerial technology’’ innovations has been largely ignored, except for very few qualitative works. In this paper, I argue that ‘‘managerial technology’’ played a key role in shaping U.S. WWII production and its capacity to defeat some of the most advanced economies in the world. The large-scale diffusion of innovative management practices to US firms involved in war production acted as a technology that put them on a higher growth path for decades. Moreover, it made U.S. managerial practices internationally distinctive and helped create the so-called “American Way” of business, which was exported to war-torn European and Japanese economies in the war aftermath.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31980,31980,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Whose Preferences Matter for Redistribution: Cross-country Evidence,"Michel Marechal, Alain Cohn, Jeffrey Yusof, Raymond Fisman","Using cross-sectional data from 93 countries, we investigate the relationship between the desired level of redistribution among citizens from different socioeconomic backgrounds and the actual extent of government redistribution. Our focus on redistribution arises from the inherent class conflicts it engenders in policy choices, allowing us to examine whose preferences are reflected in policy formulation. Contrary to prevailing assumptions regarding political influence, we find that the preferences of the lower socioeconomic group, rather than those of the median or upper strata, are most predictive of realized redistribution.

"School Management Takeover, Leadership Change, and Personnel Policy","Emma Duchini, Victor Lavy, Stephen Machin, Shqiponja Telhaj","Low-performing, high-poverty, public schools notoriously struggle to attract and retain good teachers. This paper studies a setting where independent organizations, including charities and businesses, take over the management of under-performing schools, while funding remains public. Exploiting the staggered expansion of English Sponsor-led academies since the early 2000s, we show that the Sponsor-led takeover leads to substantial changes in the teaching body and the school personnel policy. The probability that the Sponsor appoints a new headteacher doubles upon the takeover, with the new headteacher being, on average, better paid, and more likely to come from outstanding schools. The takeover also induces teacher sorting, with older and lower-achieving teachers leaving the school, and new teachers joining the Sponsor-led school from outstanding schools. Lastly, Sponsors substantially restructure teachers’ rewarding scheme and abandon a pay scale entirely based on seniority, leading to a 10 percent increase in pay dispersion across equally experienced teachers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31994,31994,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023

In contrast, European countries such as Denmark, France, and the United Kingdom did not experience a similar shift in valuations.

How Rules and Compliance Impact Organizational Outcomes: Evidence from Delegation in Environmental Regulation,"James Fenske, Muhammad Haseeb, Namrata Kala","Formal rules within organizations are pervasive, but may be interpreted and implemented differently by actors within the organization, impacting organizational outcomes. We consider a delegation reform that changed formal rules within the environmental regulator in an Indian state, by giving decision rights to junior officers over certain types of application. Using novel data on firms' environmental permit applications and internal communications within the regulator, we study how the delegation of formal authority affects its actual allocation, the consequences for applicant firms, and the circumstances that lead senior officers to withhold this authority. The change in decision rights led to greater approval rates for applicant firms. However, only two thirds of applications that should have been delegated according to the rules were actually delegated. We show that senior officers chose to retain decision rights over more difficult applications, namely, applications with higher pollution potential. Furthermore, baseline disagreement with more subordinates' recommendations reduces delegation post-reform, and officers facing a higher backlog of applications are more likely to delegate. These results are consistent with a framework where the allocation of decision rights is determined by a knowledge hierarchy and where different senior officers face varying costs of delegation at different times.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31991,31991,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
"Emigration, Business Dynamics, and Firm Heterogeneity in North Macedonia","Ninghui Li, Thomas Pihl Gade","High emigration rates are a challenge in the Western Balkans. High emigration rates might lead to inadequate skilled labor and affect firm creation, capital formation, and economic convergence. The 2021 North Macedonia census reveals that more than 12.4% of North Macedonians live abroad. To assess the consequences, we estimate the impact of emigration on the number of firms and capital formation. Business dynamics can affect emigration reversely. To alleviate the endogeneity bias, we use a shift-share instrument with the historical diaspora networks and destination countries’ GDP growth rate as a source of exogenous variations. Our results show that (1) In the short run, a 1 percentage point increase in the emigration rate leads to a 2.91% decrease in the number of firms in the area of origin; (2) The long-run effects of emigration on the number of firms are less negative than the short-run impacts; (3) Emigration mainly reduces the number of micro and small firms; (4) Emigration affects the number of firms and capital formation more in the industrial sector than the other sectors, through the skilled labor shortage channel. This paper contributes to the literature on emigration and provides implications and policy considerations for developing countries, where high emigration rates are prevalent.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/22/Emigration-Business-Dynamics-and-Firm-Heterogeneity-in-North-Macedonia-542839,WPIEA2023268,"Fri, 22 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/28/2023
Dealing with Imperfect Randomization: Inference for the HighScope Perry Preschool Program,"James J. Heckman, Rodrigo Pinto, Azeem Shaikh","This paper considers the problem of making inferences about the effects of a program on multiple outcomes when the assignment of treatment status is imperfectly randomized. By imperfect randomization we mean that treatment status is reassigned after an initial randomization on the basis of characteristics that may be observed or unobserved by the analyst. We develop a partial identification approach to this problem that makes use of information limiting the extent to which randomization is imperfect to show that it is still possible to make nontrivial inferences about the effects of the program in such settings. We consider a family of null hypotheses in which each null hypothesis specifies that the program has no effect on one of many outcomes of interest. Under weak assumptions, we construct a procedure for testing this family of null hypotheses in a way that controls the familywise error rate--the probability of even one false rejection--in finite samples. We develop our methodology in the context of a reanalysis of the HighScope Perry Preschool program.

Fund Flows and Income Risk of Fund Managers,"Xiao Cen, Winston Wei Dou, Leonid Kogan, Wei Wu","Investment fund managers make asset allocation decisions on behalf of a significant segment of US households. To elucidate the incentives they operate under, as well as the income and career risks they face, we construct a unique and novel dataset, which encompasses detailed information on the compensation and career trajectories of managers within US active equity mutual funds. The dataset is the first-ever to contain such information, having been compiled based on the US Census Bureau's LEHD program and leveraging various “big” textual data sources. Our causal evidence indicates that, contrary to fund disclosures, managers' pay is primarily driven by Assets Under Management (AUM), with performance influencing compensation only via AUM. Fund flows, although they do not align with client interests, have a significant 6% positive impact on compensation for every one-standard-deviation increase. Systematic flow components impact base salaries, while idiosyncratic elements alter bonuses. Crucially, fund flows, as opposed to fund performance, exert a strong impact on the career outcomes of fund managers, especially concerning their downside career risk. Specifically, large fund outflows elevate a manager's likelihood of job turnover (with a substantial decline in income) by 4 percentage points.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31986,31986,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Indexing and the Incorporation of Exogenous Information Shocks to Stock Prices,"Randall Morck, M.

Increased indexing impedes incorporation of idiosyncratic information into stock prices. We limit endogeneity bias by showing that exogenous idiosyncratic currency shocks induce smaller idiosyncratic moves in the stock prices of currency-sensitive firms in proximate time windows when in the index than when not in it. Increased indexing thus appears to be undermining the efficient markets hypothesis that supports its viability.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31975,31975,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Firm Accommodation After Disability: Labor Market Impacts and Implications for Social Insurance,"Naoki Aizawa, Corina Mommaerts, Stephanie L. Rennane","This paper studies the labor market impacts of firm accommodation decisions and assesses implications for the design of social insurance for workplace disability. We leverage a unique workers’ compensation (WC) program in Oregon that provides wage subsidies to firms for accommodating injured workers. Exploiting rich administrative data and a policy change to the wage subsidy, we show that accommodation rates respond to the subsidy rate and that receipt of accommodation leads to a significant increase in employment and earnings a year later. To explore welfare implications, we develop and estimate a frictional labor market model of accommodation as a form of human capital investment. Worker turnover and imperfect experience rating in WC lead to under-accommodation and inefficient labor market outcomes after workplace disability. Counterfactual simulations show that subsidizing accommodation not only improves long-run labor market outcomes of workers experiencing work-related disability but also leads to welfare gains for most workers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31978,31978,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023

Garfinkel, Nathan Goldschlag, Daniel Kifer, Philip Leclerc, Ethan Lew, Scott Moore, Rolando A. Rodríguez, Ramy N. Tadros, Lars Vilhuber","Using only 34 published tables, we reconstruct five variables (census block, sex, age, race, and ethnicity) in the confidential 2010 Census person records. Using the 38-bin age variable tabulated at the census block level, at most 20.1% of reconstructed records can differ from their confidential source on even a single value for these five variables. Using only published data, an attacker can verify that all records in 70% of all census blocks (97 million people) are perfectly reconstructed. The tabular publications in Summary File 1 thus have prohibited disclosure risk similar to the unreleased confidential microdata. Reidentification studies confirm that an attacker can, within blocks with perfect reconstruction accuracy, correctly infer the actual census response on race and ethnicity for 3.4 million vulnerable population uniques (persons with nonmodal characteristics) with 95% accuracy, the same precision as the confidential data achieve and far greater than statistical baselines. The flaw in the 2010 Census framework was the assumption that aggregation prevented accurate microdata reconstruction, justifying weaker disclosure limitation methods than were applied to 2010 Census public microdata. The framework used for 2020 Census publications defends against attacks that are based on reconstruction, as we also demonstrate here. Finally, we show that alternatives to the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System with similar accuracy (enhanced swapping) also fail to protect confidentiality, and those that partially defend against reconstruction attacks (incomplete suppression implementations) destroy the primary statutory use case: data for redistricting all legislatures in the country in compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31995,31995,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Professional Motivations in the Public Sector: Evidence from Police Officers,"Aaron Chalfin, Felipe M. Gonçalves","We study how public sector workers balance their professional motivations with private economic concerns, focusing on police arrests. Arrests made near the end of an officer's shift typically require overtime work, and officers respond by reducing arrest frequency but increasing arrest quality. Days in which an officer works a second job after their police shift have higher opportunity cost, also reducing late-shift arrests. Combining our estimates in a dynamic model identifies officer preferences over workplace activity and overtime work. Our results indicate that officers' private costs of arrests have a first-order impact on the quantity and quality of enforcement.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31985,31985,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Do Cities Mitigate or Exacerbate Environmental Damages to Health?,"David Molitor, Corey D. White","Do environmental conditions pose greater health risks to individuals living in urban or rural areas? The answer is theoretically ambiguous: while urban areas have traditionally been associated with heightened exposure to environmental pollutants, the economies of scale and density inherent to urban environments offer unique opportunities for mitigating or adapting to these harmful exposures. To make progress on this question, we focus on the United States and consider how exposures—to air pollution, drinking water pollution, and extreme temperatures—and the response to those exposures differ across urban and rural settings. While prior studies have addressed some aspects of these issues, substantial gaps in knowledge remain, in large part due to historical deficiencies in monitoring and reporting, especially in rural areas. As a step toward closing these gaps, we present new evidence on urban-rural differences in air quality and population sensitivity to air pollution, leveraging recent advances in remote sensing measurement and machine learning. We find that the urban-rural gap in fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) has converged over the last two decades and the remaining gap is small relative to the overall declines. Furthermore, we find that residents of urban counties are, on average, less vulnerable to the mortality effects of PM₂.₅ exposure. We also discuss promising areas for future research.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31990,31990,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Improving Regulation for Innovation: Evidence from China’s Pharmaceutical Industry,"Ruixue Jia, Xiao Ma, Jianan Yang, Yiran Zhang","This study investigates how enhanced regulation can promote innovation, focusing on the impacts of a significant regulatory reform in China's pharmaceutical sector implemented in 2015. Inspired by regulatory practices in the U.S., the reform aimed to address application backlogs and reduce administrative waiting time for new drug development. Using data at the drug and firm levels during 2012--2021, we make three main findings: (1) drug categories experiencing improved approval times witnessed a surge in investigational new drug applications and related clinical trials; (2) despite little improvement in innovativeness (measured by novel targets unexplored by U.S. counterparts) within drug categories, the reform led to changes in firm composition, attracting innovative new firms and boosting overall drug innovativeness; and (3) the market recognized the improvement in drug innovation, as reflected in stock price adjustments post new drug registrations after the reform. Our findings demonstrate that regulatory barriers can hinder the entry of innovative firms and suggest that latecomers could boost their innovation potential by adopting specific, effective regulatory practices from frontier countries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31976,31976,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Labor Market Tightness and Union Activity,"Chantal Pezold, Simon Jäger, Patrick Nüss","We study how labor market conditions affect unionization decisions. Tight labor markets might spur unionization, e.g., by reducing the threat of unemployment after management opposition or employer retaliation in response to a unionization attempt. Tightness might also weaken unionization by providing attractive outside alternatives to engaging in costly unionization. Drawing on a large-scale, representative survey experiment among U.S. workers, we show that an increase in worker beliefs about labor market tightness moderately raises support for union activity. Effect sizes are small as they imply that moving from trough to peak of the business cycle increases workers’ probability of voting for a union by one percentage point. To study equilibrium effects, we draw on three quasi-experimental research designs using data from across U.S. states and counties over several decades. We find no systematic effect of changes in aggregate labor market tightness on union membership, union elections, and strikes. Overall, our results challenge the notion that labor market tightness significantly drives U.S. unionization.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31988,31988,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023

Online Job Posts Contain Very Little Wage Information,"Honey Batra, Amanda Michaud, Simon Mongey","We present six facts that characterize the little wage information contained in the universe of online job posts in the U.S. First, wage information is rare: only 14% of posts contain any wage information and the minority of these (6%) have a point wage. The majority (8%) feature a range of wages that are on average wide, spanning 28% of the midpoint (e.g. $21-28/hr or $32,000$42,000/yr). Second, information varies systematically along the occupation-wage gradient. Third, posted wages are 40% higher than wages in BLS data in low-wage occupations and 20% lower than BLS data in high-wage occupations. Fourth, among the wages that are posted, high wage firms are more opaque, with more and wider ranges. Fifth, there is zero correlation between wage information and local labor market tightness. Sixth, of the top 20 posting private firms, none have any wage information in more than 2% of their posts. Our findings caution against treating wage data from job postings as a stand-in for administrative data. We provide an example of bias in econometric inference that worsens as wage information falls.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31984,31984,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
Infrastructure Inequality: Who Pays the Cost of Road Roughness?,"Lindsey Currier, Edward L. Glaeser, Gabriel E. Kreindler","Which Americans experience the worst infrastructure? What are the costs of living with that infrastructure? We measure road roughness throughout America using vertical acceleration data from Uber rides across millions of American roads. Our measure correlates strongly and positively with other measures of road roughness where they are available, negatively with driver speed, and we find road repair events decrease roughness and increase speeds. We measure drivers’ willingness-to-pay to avoid roughness by measuring how speeds change with salient changes in road roughness, such as those associated with town borders and road repaving events in Chicago.  These estimates suggest the roughness of the median local road in the US generates welfare losses to drivers of at least 31 cents per driver-mile. Roads are worse near coasts, and in poorer towns and in poorer neighborhoods, even within towns. We find that a household that drives 3,000 miles annually on predominantly local roads will suffer $318 per year more in driving pain if they live in a predominantly Black neighborhood than in a predominantly White neighborhood. Road roughness modestly predicts subsequent road resurfacing in New York City, but not in three other cities, which suggests that repaving is only weakly targeted towards damaged roads. Surveys from 120 towns and cities across the US suggest many reasons why resurfacing seems to be weakly targeted.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31981,31981,23-Dec,NBER,12/28/2023
The Psychology of Poverty: Where Do We Stand?,"Johannes Haushofer, Daniel Salicath","In recent years, the psychological causes and consequences of poverty have received renewed attention from scientists and policymakers. In this review, we summarize new developments in this literature. First, we discuss advances in our understanding of the relationship between income and psychological well-being. There is a robust positive relationship between the two, both within and across countries, and in correlational and causal analyses. Second, we summarize recent work on the impact of “scarcity” and stress on economic preferences and decision-making. Our view of this literature is that the evidence is relatively weak. Third, we summarize evidence on the impact of psychological interventions on economic outcomes. Light-touch psychological interventions, such as videos that aim to raise aspirations, have shown some promise in encouraging investment and improving economic well-being. Similarly, psychotherapy and pharmacological mental health treatments have positive effects on economic outcomes. Relative to the effects of cash transfers, these impacts are small in absolute terms and large in per-dollar terms.

Designing a Presumptive Income Tax Based on Turnover in Countries with Large Informal Sectors,"Feng Wei, Jean-François Wen","Turnover (sales) is frequently used in developing countries as a presumptive income tax base, to economize on the costs of tax administration and taxpayer compliance. We construct a simple model where a size threshold separates firms paying turnover tax from those paying profit tax (regular income tax), and where firms have the option of producing in the untaxed, informal sector. The optimal turnover tax rate trades off two policy concerns: reducing informality and avoiding strategic reductions in sales by firms seeking to remain below the threshold for the profit tax. We provide analytical results and calibrate the model to compute the optimal policy using realistic parameter values. The optimal turnover tax rate for countries with large informal sectors is found to be around 2.5% across most scenarios, while the threshold separating the turnover tax regime from profit tax lies for the most part between $65,000 and $95,000. Introducing an optimally designed turnover tax reduces the rate of informality of businesses by about 12 percentage points in the calibrated model.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/22/Designing-a-Presumptive-Income-Tax-Based-on-Turnover-in-Countries-with-Large-Informal-542831,WPIEA2023267,"Fri, 22 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/28/2023

As part of the campaign, protestors from across the country were transported to Washington, D.C. in 6 separate bus caravans, each of which made stops en route to rest, recruit, and hold non-violent protests.  Using data from 1960-1970, we estimate the effects of these protests on congressional election outcomes.

Divided We Fall: Differential Exposure to Geopolitical Fragmentation in Trade,"Shushanik Hakobyan, Sergii Meleshchuk, Robert Zymek","This paper assesses differences in countries’ macroeconomic exposure to trade fragmentation along geopolitical lines. Estimating structural gravity regressions for sector-level bilateral trade flows between 185 countries, we find that differences in individual countries’ geopolitical ties act as a barrier to trade, with the largest effects concentrated in a few sectors (notably, food and high-end manufacturing). Consequently, countries’ exposure via trade to geopolitical shifts varies with their market size, comparative advantage, and foreign policy alignments. Introducing our estimates into a dynamic many-country, many-sector quantitative trade model, we show that geoeconomic fragmentation—modelled as an increased sensitivity of trade costs to geopolitics and greater geopolitical polarization—generally leads to lower trade and incomes. However, emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) tend to see the largest impacts: real per-capita income losses for the median EMDE in Asia are 80 percent larger, and for the median EMDE in Africa 120 percent larger, than for the median advanced economy. This suggests that the costs of trade fragmentation could fall disproportionally on countries that can afford it the least.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/22/Divided-We-Fall-Differential-Exposure-to-Geopolitical-Fragmentation-in-Trade-542842,WPIEA2023270,"Fri, 22 Dec 2023 ",IMF,12/28/2023

Incarcerated mothers had babies who were less healthy at birth. This decrease in health represents a shift in the entire birthweight distribution due to exposure to prison camps.

Although we find that brokers influence product choices, the main reason borrowers choose high-leverage products is unobserved preferences.

Can Supply Shocks Be Inflationary with a Flat Phillips Curve?,"Jean-Paul L’Huillier, Gregory Phelan","Not in standard models. With conventional pricing frictions, imposing a flat Phillips curve also imposes a price level that is rigid with respect to supply shocks. In the New Keynesian model, price markup shocks need to be several orders of magnitude bigger than other shocks in order to fit the data, leading to unreasonable assessments of the magnitude of the increase in costs during inflationary episodes. To account for the facts, we propose a strategic microfoundation of shock-dependent price stickiness: prices are sticky with respect to demand shocks but flexible with respect to supply shocks. This friction is demand-intrinsic, in line with narrative accounts for the imperfect adjustment of prices. Firms can credibly justify a price increase due to a rise in costs, whereas it is harder to do so when demand increases. Inflation from supply shocks is efficient and does not justify a monetary policy response.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2336-can-supply-shocks-be-inflationary-with-flat-phillips-curve,23-36,12.28.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,12/31/2023
Migration Policy and the Supply of Foreign Physicians: Evidence from the Conrad 30 Waiver Program,"Breno Braga, Gaurav Khanna, Sarah Turner","In the United States, rural and low-income communities have difficulty attracting and retaining physicians, potentially adversely impacting health outcomes. With a limited supply of physicians completing medical school at US universities, foreign-born and educated physicians provide a potential source of supply in underserved areas. For international medical school graduates (IMGs) the terms of the commonly used J-1 visa require a return to the home country for two years following employment in medical residency.  Our analysis examines the extent to which the Conrad 30 Visa Waiver impacts the supply of physicians at state and local levels, particularly in areas designated as medically underserved. Changes in the federal limit on the number of waivers per state, combined with variation in the state-level restrictions on eligible specialties, and geographies in which physicians can work, provide evidence on the role of visa restrictions in limiting the supply of doctors. Expansion of the cap on visa waivers increased the supply of IMGs, particularly in states that did not limit waiver recipients to primary care physicians or particular places of employment. There is little evidence of reductions in US-trained doctors in states where IMG increases were the largest, suggesting little evidence for crowding out.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32005,32005,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Lifetime Memories of Inflation: Evidence from Surveys and the Lab,"Isabelle Salle, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Olivier Coibion","We study how individuals’ memories of inflation shape their expectations about future inflation using both surveys and laboratory experiments. Recalling having lived through prior disinflations has pronounced effects on how long-lived people expect the current inflation episode to last. Information treatments in which we show people prior disinflationary experiences similarly strongly reduce inflation expectations of individuals on average and are often recalled as inflation memories months later. We also show that when people try to forecast inflation in the lab, the inflation dynamics in the game can affect their beliefs much like the inflation experienced in real life. Methodologically, we compare and contrast surveys and lab experiments and discuss the pros and cons of each method, emphasizing the general consistency across the two methodologies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31996,31996,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Monopsony Amplifies Distortions from Progressive Taxes,"David W. Berger, Kyle F. Herkenhoff, Simon Mongey, Negin Mousavi","In this short paper we show that progressive income taxes distort hiring and wages when firms have labor market power. From a firm’s perspective, raising pre-tax wages increases employment by less when taxes are progressive as less of the pre-tax wage is paid to workers. Understanding this when setting wages leads to lower wages and employment at all firms. When firms differ in productivity, progressive taxes also distort the allocation of labor across firms. We characterize this novel monopsony cost of progressivity in a simple monopsony economy and derive efficiency wedges that depend on progressivity. A simple quantification of these wedges points to the possibility that the monopsony cost may be of similar magnitudes to redistribution and insurance benefits.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31972,31972,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024

Our dataset covers a broad range of households across the wealth distribution, notably including 439 billionaires. This ensures representation of ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) households that are typically not well covered in survey data. With these data, we study the portfolio rebalancing behavior of households and ask whether (and, if so, which) households play an important stabilizing role in financial markets. Our findings reveal a stark contrast: less affluent households sell U.S. equities amid market downturns, while UHNW households buy and contribute to stabilizing markets. This behavior is more pronounced among households who rebalance their portfolios more frequently. However, the sensitivity of flows to returns is generally quite small and as the trades of different wealth groups partly offset each other, the aggregate household sector plays a limited role to absorb financial fluctuations. To understand the contrasting trading behavior across households, we show that a household’s flows to U.S. equities are negatively correlated with its “active returns” (the difference between an investor’s return and the market return). However, the flows to U.S. equities of less affluent households are also positively correlated with broad market returns – perhaps due to shifts in risk aversion, sentiment, or perceived macroeconomic risk – leading this group of households to act pro-cyclically. Across all asset classes, three factors with intuitive economic interpretations explain 81% of all variation in portfolio rebalancing. Those factors bet on the long-term equity premium, the credit premium, and the premium on municipal bonds. In sum, our framework paints a quantitative picture of U.S. households’ assets and rebalancing marked by a great deal of insensitivity and inertia throughout the distribution, even for UHNW households. These new facts are useful for the calibration of macro-finance models with heterogeneous households and multiple risky asset classes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32001,32001,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
The Informational Centrality of Banks,"Nathan Foley-Fisher, Gary B. Gorton, Stéphane Verani","The equity and debt prices of large nonbank firms contain information about the future state of the banking system. In this sense, banks are informationally central. The amount of this information varies over time and over equity and debt. During a financial crisis banks are, by definition of a crisis, at risk of failure. Debt prices became about 50 percent more informative than equity prices about the future state of the banking system during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. This was partly due to investors’ fears that banks might not be able to refinance their debt.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32007,32007,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
What Drives the Exchange Rate?,"Oleg Itskhoki, Dmitry Mukhin","We use a general open-economy wedge-accounting framework to characterize the set of shocks that can account for major exchange rate puzzles. Focusing on a near-autarky behavior of the economy, we show analytically that all standard macroeconomic shocks — including productivity, monetary, government spending, and markup shocks — are inconsistent with the broad properties of the macro exchange rate disconnect. News shocks about future macroeconomic fundamentals can generate plausible exchange rate properties. However, they show up prominently in contemporaneous asset prices, which violates the finance exchange rate disconnect. International shocks to trade costs, terms of trade and import demand, while potentially consistent with disconnect, do not robustly generate the empirical Backus-Smith, UIP and terms-of-trade properties. In contrast, the observed exchange rate behavior is consistent with risk-sharing (financial) shocks that arise from shifts in demand of foreign investors for home-currency assets, or vice versa.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32008,32008,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Organized Crime and Economic Growth: Evidence from Municipalities Infiltrated by the Mafia,"Alessandra Fenizia, Raffaele Saggio","This paper studies the long-run economic impact of dismissing city councils infiltrated by organized crime. Applying a matched difference-in-differences design to the universe of Italian social security records, we find that city council dismissals (CCDs) increase employment, the number of firms, and industrial real estate prices. The effects are concentrated in Mafia-dominated sectors and in municipalities where fewer incumbents are re-elected. The dismissals generate large economic returns by weakening the Mafia and fostering trust in local institutions. The analysis suggests that CCDs represent an effective intervention for establishing legitimacy and spurring economic activity in areas dominated by organized crime.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32002,32002,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
An IV Hazard Model of Loan Default with an Application to Subprime Mortgage Cohorts,Christopher Palmer,"This paper develops a control-function methodology accounting for endogenous or mismeasured regressors in hazard models. I provide sufficient identifying assumptions and regularity conditions for the estimator to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Applying my estimator to the subprime mortgage crisis, I quantify what caused the foreclosure rate to triple across the 2003-2007 subprime cohorts. To identify the elasticity of default with respect to housing prices, I use various home-price instruments including historical variation in home-price cyclicality. Loose credit played a significant role in the crisis, but much of the increase in defaults across cohorts was caused by home-price declines unrelated to lending standards, with a 10% decline in home prices increasing subprime mortgage default rates by 50%.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32000,32000,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
"Innovation Booms, Easy Financing, and Human Capital Accumulation","Johan Hombert, Adrien Matray","Innovation booms are often fueled by easy financing that allows new technology firms to pay high wages that attracts skilled labor. Using the late 1990s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) boom as a laboratory, we show that skilled labor joining this new sector experienced sizeable long-term earnings losses. We show these earnings patterns are explained by faster skill obsolescence rather than either worker selection or the overall bust in the ICT sector. During the boom, financing flowed more to firms whose workers would experience the largest productivity declines, amplifying the negative effect of labor reallocation on aggregate human capital accumulation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32012,32012,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Firms and Worker Health,"Alexander Ahammer, Analisa Packham, Jonathan Smith","We estimate the role of firms in worker health care utilization. Using linked administrative data on Austrian workers from 1998-2018, we exploit mobility between firms to estimate how much a firm contributes to worker-level differences in utilization in a setting with non-employer provided universal health care. We find that firms are responsible for nearly 30 percent of the variation in across-worker health care expenditures. Effects are not driven by changes in geography or industry. We then estimate a measure of relative firm-specific utilization and explore existing correlates to help explain these effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32011,32011,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Market Design for Surface Water,"Billy A.

While these reviews help limit externalities, they impose substantial transaction costs that also limit trade. To promote a well-functioning market for surface water in California, we describe how a new kind of water right and related regulatory practices can balance the trade-off between externalities and transaction costs, and how a Water Incentive Auction can incentivize a sufficient number of current rights holders to swap their old rights for the new ones.

Population and Welfare: The Greatest Good for the Greatest Number,"Mohamad Adhami, Mark Bils, Charles I. Jones, Peter J. Klenow","Economic growth is typically measured in per capita terms. But social welfare should arguably include the number of people as well as their standard of living. We decompose social welfare growth — measured in consumption-equivalent (CE) units — into contributions from rising population and rising per capita consumption. Because of diminishing marginal utility from consumption, population growth is scaled up by a value-of-life factor that exceeds one and empirically averages nearly 3 across countries since 1960. Population increases are therefore a major contributor, and CE welfare growth around the world averages more than 6% per year since 1960 as opposed to 2% per year for consumption growth. Countries such as Mexico and South Africa rise sharply in the growth rankings, whereas China, Germany, and Japan plummet. These results are robust to incorporating time use and fertility decisions using data from the U.S., Mexico, the Netherlands, Japan, South Africa, and South Korea. Falling parental utility from having fewer kids is roughly offset by increases in the “quality” of kids associated with rising time investment per child.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31999,31999,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
"Wellbeing, Expectations and Unemployment in Europe","David G. Blanchflower, Alex Bryson","We find expectations are more sensitive to economic growth than traditional wellbeing metrics. We examine Eurobarometer micro data from 1973-2023 on movements in life satisfaction along with data from 1995-2022 on five expectations variables on and individual’s life and their financial and job situations plus their views on the economic and employment situation of their country in the year ahead.  These expectations start to decline several months before the onset of downturns with especially large drops for the Great Recession and Covid.  Annual GDP growth is positively associated with these expectations variables while it is uncorrelated with life satisfaction.  The unemployment rate and the CPI reduce both.  We analyze data for 29 European countries to predict changes in the unemployment rate 12 months ahead using individuals’ fears of unemployment in the presence of country and year fixed effects and lagged unemployment.  We also use firms' expectations of future employment, which are also predictive of what happens to unemployment three months later.  Using our preferred model specification, we present out-of-sample predictions that track actual movements in unemployment rates closely over a period in which there were two major recessions and unemployment shifted by a factor of two.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32006,32006,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Financial Integration and Monetary Policy Coordination,"Javier Bianchi, Louphou Coulibaly","Financial integration generates macroeconomic spillovers that may require international monetary policy coordination. We show that individual central banks may set nominal interest rates too low or too high relative to the cooperative outcome. We identify three sufficient statistics that determine whether the Nash equilibrium exhibits under-tightening or over-tightening: the output gap, sectoral differences in labor intensity, and the trade balance response to changes in nominal rates. Independently of the shocks hitting the economy, we find that under-tightening is possible during economic expansions or contractions. For large shocks, the gains from coordination can be substantial.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32009,32009,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Valuing Technology Complementarities: Rooftop Solar and Energy Storage,"Bryan Bollinger, Naim Darghouth, Kenneth Gillingham, Andres Gonzalez-Lira","Product complementarities can shape market patterns, influencing the demand for related products and their accessories. This study examines complementarities in the demand for rooftop solar and an accessory, battery energy storage. Using nationwide administrative data, we estimate a dynamic nested-logit model of solar and storage adoption. We quantify the demand complementarity between solar and storage, and find that if storage was not available, 20% of households who coadopt solar and storage would not adopt anything. We find that the demand for solar and storage bundles increases with power outages, with a larger effect in California.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32003,32003,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024
Girls’ Night In? Effects of the Kenyan COVID-19 Lockdown on Web Browsing,"Soledad Giardili, Sanjay Jain, Amalia R. Miller, Kamalini Ramdas, Alp Sungu","We present the first objective evidence on how COVID-19 lockdowns affected internet browser usage in Africa, using detailed digital trace data on PC-based and mobile-based browsing patterns of 316 Kenyans who had access to a PC, covering the period before and during Kenya’s first national COVID-19 curfew that was declared on March 25, 2020. We find that total daily browser usage increased by 41 minutes, or 15 percent of average browsing time, after the curfew started. We find no significant differences in total browsing time during the curfew by gender or by residence in high-speed vs. low-speed broadband access areas. However, we do find gender differences in the content of browsing. Women’s time on YouTube and Netflix exceeded men’s from the start of our sample period, and the gender gap in Netflix browsing increased by 36 minutes daily, corresponding to almost twice the average daily Netflix time in the sample. Men’s browsing became less concentrated during the curfew, across both domains and topics, but women’s did not. The degree of overlap in browsing between men and women also increased, likely due to men visiting sites that were previously exclusively visited by women. Across the entire sample, browsing of Kenyan domains dropped significantly relative to that of non-Kenyan domains, indicating greater reliance on international content during this period of economic and social upheaval.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31997,31997,24-Jan,NBER,1/2/2024

The Effects of Interest Rate Increases on Consumers' Inflation Expectations: The Roles of Informedness and Compliance,"Edward S. Knotek II, James Mitchell, Mathieu Pedemonte, Taylor Shiroff","We study how monetary policy communications associated with increasing the federal funds rate causally affect consumers' inflation expectations. In a large-scale, multi-wave randomized controlled trial (RCT), we find weak evidence on average that communicating policy changes lowers consumers' medium-term inflation expectations. However, information differs systematically across demographic groups, in terms of ex ante informedness about monetary policy and ex post compliance with the information treatment. Monetary policy communications have a much stronger effect on people who had not previously heard news about monetary policy and who take sufficient time to read the treatment, implying scope to increase the impact of communications by targeting specific groups of the general public. Our findings show that, in an inflationary environment, consumers expect that raising interest rates will lower inflation. More generally, our results emphasize the importance of measuring both respondents' information sets and their compliance with treatment when using RCTs in empirical macroeconomics, to better understand the well-documented evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2401-consumers-inflation-expectations,24-01,01.03.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,1/3/2024

The Effect of Component Disaggregation on Measures of the Median and Trimmed-Mean CPI,"Christian Garciga, Randal J. Verbrugge, Saeed Zaman","For decades, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC) has produced median and trimmed-mean consumer price index (CPI) measures. These have proven useful in various contexts, such as forecasting and understanding post-COVID inflation dynamics. Revisions to the FRBC methodology have historically involved increasing the level of disaggregation in the CPI components, which has improved accuracy. Thus, it may seem logical that further disaggregation would continue to enhance its accuracy. However, we theoretically demonstrate that this may not necessarily be the case. We then explore the empirical impact of further disaggregation along two dimensions: shelter and non-shelter components. We find that significantly increasing the disaggregation in the shelter indexes, when combined with only a slight increase in non-shelter disaggregation, improves the ability of the median and trimmed-mean CPI to track the medium-term trend in CPI inflation and marginally increases predictive power over future movements in CPI inflation. Finally, we examine the practical implications of our preferred degree of disaggregation. Our preferred measure of the median CPI suggests that trend inflation was lower pre-pandemic, while both our preferred median and trimmed-mean measures suggest a faster acceleration in trend inflation in 2021. We also find that higher disaggregation marginally weakens the Phillips curve relationship between median CPI inflation and the unemployment gap, though it remains statistically significant.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2402-effect-of-component-disaggregation,24-02,01.04.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,1/4/2024
The Return of Industrial Policy in Data,"Simon Evenett, Adam Jakubik, Fernando Martín, Michele Ruta","This paper introduces the New Industrial Policy Observatory (NIPO) dataset and documents emergent patterns of policy intervention during 2023 associated with the return of industrial policy. The data show that the recent wave of new industrial policy activity is primarily driven by advanced economies, and that subsidies are the most employed instrument. Trade restrictions on imports and exports are more frequently used by emerging market and developing economies. Strategic competitiveness is the dominant motive governments give for these measures, but other objectives such as climate change, resilience and national security are on the rise. In exploratory regressions, we find that implemented measures are correlated with the past use of measures by other governments in the same sector, pointing to the tit-for-tat nature of industrial policy. Furthermore, domestic political economy factors and macroeconomic conditions correlate with the use of industrial policy measures. We intend for the NIPO to be a publicly available resource to help monitor the evolution and effects of industrial policies.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/23/The-Return-of-Industrial-Policy-in-Data-542828,WPIEA2024001,"Thu, 04 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/4/2024
Energy Hogs and Energy Angels: What Does Residential Electricity Usage Really Tell Us About Profligate Consumption?,Severin Borenstein,"Since the 1970s, high volumetric (per kilowatt-hour) electricity prices have been justified in many policy discussions as encouraging more efficient use of electricity and placing more of the cost burden on those who are less prudent in their use. The argument has been used in support of increasing-block electricity pricing, under which the price per kilowatt-hour rises as a household consumes more electricity per month. More recently, in California, opponents of a proposal to lower volumetric prices and replace the revenue through fixed monthly charges have suggested that the change would just benefit “energy hogs”. In this paper, I first investigate characteristics of households who are high electricity consumers and ask how effectively such pricing targets profligate residential electricity consumption. I then look more broadly at the energy usage individuals are responsible for in the economy, how other energy usage is priced, and the role that residential electricity use plays in the overall picture. Finally, I connect the discussion of profligate direct and indirect energy consumption with the negative externalities produced, which are typically the justification for such penalty pricing.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32023,32023,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
"The Rise of Factor Investing: ""Passive"" Security Design and Market Implications","Lin William Cong, Shiyang Huang, Douglas Xu","We model financial innovations such as Exchange-Traded Funds, smart beta products, and many index-based vehicles as composite securities (CSs) that facilitate trading the common factors in assets' liquidation values. Through accessing a larger basket of assets in endogenously chosen proportions, CSs reduce investors' duplication of effort in trading multiple securities and attract more factor investors. We characterize analytically how competitive CS designers in equilibrium optimally select liquid underlying assets representative of the factors and find corroborating evidence in ETF data. CS trading entails investors' strategic and active decisions, consequently impounding more systematic information into prices. Their rise creates leads to greater informational efficiency, price variability, and co-movements in the underlying asset markets, as well as potentially heterogeneous effects on liquidity and asset-specific information acquisition/incorporation, depending on the importance of factors for asset value. The predictions explain and reconcile the rich (and often mixed) empirical observations about various types of CSs in the extant literature.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32016,32016,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024

"Refinancing Frictions, Mortgage Pricing and Redistribution","David W. Berger, Konstantin Milbradt, Fabrice Tourre, Joseph S. Vavra","There are large cross-sectional differences in how often US borrowers refinance mortgages. In this paper, we develop an equilibrium mortgage pricing model with heterogeneous borrowers and use it to show that equilibrium forces imply important cross-subsidies from borrowers who rarely refinance to those who refinance often. Mortgage reforms can potentially reduce these regressive cross-subsidies, but the equilibrium effects of these reforms can also have important distributional consequences. For example, many policies that lead to more frequent refinancing also increase equilibrium mortgage rates and thus reduce residential mortgage credit access for a large number of borrowers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32022,32022,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Variation in State Response to Open Access: Constituent Characteristics,Gary D. Libecap,"Open access, competitive exploitation can be incredibly damaging to valuable resources and the human populations that depend upon them. Even though wealth, resource rents and stocks are at stake, open access often seems to be ineffectively addressed across time and space. Institutions vary. Devising and assigning access and use rights of some type privately or within a group, recognized by the state, is the most straightforward way of confronting the problem.  Alternatively, regulation can be implemented that involves limiting entry, assigning input and related capital controls, restricting exploitation times, and/or setting output restrictions. Across three settings, hard-rock minerals, oil and gas deposits, and fisheries, I outline institutional differences and provide hypotheses as to why they occur.  The open-access problem is described and followed by discussion of the political economy of regulation. Variation in industry structure, resource characteristics and value, as well as heterogeneity of interests in combating open access determine outcomes.   The cases are drawn from the US, but may be representative of general patterns.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32021,32021,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Bankruptcy Exemption of Repo Markets: Too Much Today for Too Little Tomorrow?,"Viral V. Acharya, V. Ravi Anshuman, S. Vish Viswanathan","We examine the desirability of granting “safe harbor” provisions to creditors of financial intermediaries in sale-and-repurchase (repo) contracts. Exemption from an automatic stay in bankruptcy enables financial intermediaries to raise greater liquidity and induces entry of intermediaries with higher leverage during normal times. This liquidity creation occurs, however, at the cost of ex-post inefficiency when there are adverse aggregate shocks to the fundamental quality of collateral underlying the contracts. When exempt from bankruptcy, creditors of highly leveraged financial intermediaries respond to such shocks by engaging in collateral liquidations. Financial arbitrage by less leveraged financial intermediaries equilibrates returns from acquiring collateral at fire-sale prices and returns from real-sector lending, inducing higher lending rates, a deterioration in endogenous asset quality, and in the extremis, a credit crunch for the real sector. Given this distributive externality, taming the leverage cycle by not granting safe harbors, i.e., requiring an automatic stay on repo contracts in bankruptcy, can be not only ex-post optimal, but also ex-ante optimal, especially for illiquid collateral with high exposure to aggregate risk.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32027,32027,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024

Nonprofits and the Scope of Government: Theory and an Application to the Health Sector,Karen Eggleston,"Nonprofits supply many tax-financed services like healthcare and education. Yet nonprofits are absent from the canonical property rights theory of ownership. Extending the government “make or buy” decision to nonprofits and ex post frictions based on contracts as reference points suggests that contracting out to a nonprofit can be optimal when “mission” alignment credibly signals adherence to the spirit and not just the letter of the contract in unforeseen contingencies.

Trust and Health Care-Seeking Behavior,"Michael E. Darden, Mario Macis","We present results from a nationally representative survey of American adults, guided by a simple theoretical model expressing health care-seeking behavior as a function of economic and behavioral fundamentals and highlighting the role of trust. We report several findings. First, we document a strong association between higher levels of trust in the health care system and reported care-seeking behavior, both retrospective and anticipated. This relationship holds across several care scenarios, from routine check-ups to vaccinations. Second, the impact of trust on health care utilization is similar in magnitude to that of factors such as income and education, long recognized as crucial in the existing literature. Third, the relationship between trust and care-seeking behavior appears to be mediated by key mechanisms from our theoretical framework, notably individuals’ beliefs about the system's effectiveness in managing their health and their personal disutility tied to medical visits. Fourth, we ask respondents about trust in specific health care system sectors, and we find important heterogeneity in the associations between trust and care-seeking behavior, notably between trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the likelihood to receive flu and COVID-19 vaccinations. Finally, we find no differential relationship between trust and care-seeking for Black respondents, but we find important differences by age and political affiliation. Our findings hold significant implications for policy, particularly given that trust in medical and, more broadly, scientific expertise is increasingly difficult to establish.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32028,32028,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Outsourcing Policy and Worker Outcomes: Causal Evidence from a Mexican Ban,"Alejandro Estefan, Roberto Gerhard, Joseph P. Kaboski, Illenin O. Kondo, Wei Qian","A weakening of labor protection policies is often invoked as one cause of observed monopsony power and the decline in labor's share of income, but little evidence exists on the causal impact of labor policies on wage markdowns.  Using confidential Mexican economic census data from 1994 to 2019, we document a rising trend over this period in on-site outsourcing. Then, leveraging data from a manufacturing panel survey from 2013 to 2023 and a natural experiment featuring a ban on domestic outsourcing in 2021, we show that the ban drastically reduced outsourcing, increased wages, and reduced measured markdowns without lowering output or employment. Consistent with the presence of monopsony power, we observe large markdowns for the largest firms, with the decline in markdowns in response to the ban concentrated among high-markdown firms.

Negative Weights are No Concern in Design-Based Specifications,"Kirill Borusyak, Peter Hull","Recent work shows that popular partially-linear regression specifications can put negative weights on some treatment effects, potentially producing incorrectly-signed estimands. We counter by showing that negative weights are no problem in design-based specifications, in which low-dimensional controls span the conditional expectation of the treatment. Specifically, the estimands of such specifications are convex averages of causal effects with “ex-ante” weights that average the potentially negative “ex-post” weights across possible treatment realizations. This result extends to design-based instrumental variable estimands under a first-stage monotonicity condition, and applies to “formula” treatments and instruments such as shift-share instruments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32017,32017,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024

EXIM’s Exit: The Real Effects of Trade Financing by Export Credit Agencies,"Poorya Kabir, Adrien Matray, Karsten Müller, Chenzi Xu","We study the role of export credit agencies—the predominant tool of industrial policy—on firm behavior by using the effective shutdown of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) from 2015-2019 as a natural experiment. We show that firms that previously relied on EXIM support saw a 18% drop in global sales after the agency closed down, driven by a reduction in exports. Firms affected by the shutdown were unable to make up for the loss of trade financing, especially if they were financially constrained, and consequently laid off employees and curtailed investment. These negative effects were more pronounced for firms with higher export opportunities and higher ex-ante marginal revenue products of capital. Lower exports at the firm level aggregate up to lower total exports for industries most reliant on EXIM support. These findings suggest that government policies aimed at providing trade financing can boost exports and firm growth even in countries with well-developed financial markets without necessarily leading to a misallocation of resources.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32019,32019,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Disentangling Various Explanations for the Declining Labor Share: Evidence from Millions of Firm Records,Ann Harrison,"This paper uses millions of records from a cross-country and time series database of both publicly listed and private companies to disentangle the role of technological change, market power, and globalization in driving a fall in the labor share. Labor shares are measured at the enterprise level as the share of total remuneration to workers in value-added. Technological change is measured using research and development expenditures or total factor productivity growth. Market power is measured using four firm and twenty firm concentration ratios and globalization is measured as export shares in total revenues. We also supplement the cross-country evidence with a more in depth look at China using its industrial census. The evidence suggests that between 1995 and 2019 the most important driver of falling labor shares was technological change. Greater market power (measured by firm concentration ratios) also contributed to lower labor shares, but the magnitudes are smaller. Finally, the evidence on globalization is mixed: trade shares are at times negatively associated with the labor share but in the case of China there is a strong positive relationship between exporting and labor shares at the enterprise level.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32015,32015,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Haste or Waste? The Role of Presale in Residential Housing,"Ziyang Chen, Maggie Rong Hu, Ginger Zhe Jin, Qiyao Zhou","This paper provides the first theory and evidence on the role of presale policies in the residential housing market. We start with constructing a novel dataset of unfinished projects, presale policies, and land auction outcomes across 270 major cities in China. We then identify 2,330 unfinished residential projects from 2010 to 2017 on a citizen complaint website run by the central government. We find that both presale criterion and postsale supervision of construction costs relate to a lower probability of unfinished projects. But only presale criterion relates negatively to the pace of new housing development, measured by developers' multitasking and land auction outcomes. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the average bundle of presale policies is inferior to the Pareto frontier in our sampled cities. Tightening the regulation on postsale supervision by 2 standard deviations may lead to a 58% reduction in the occurrence of unfinished projects, while keeping the pace of new housing development unchanged. Eliminating unfinished projects would entail a drastic increase in both presale criterion and postsale supervision, with slower housing development.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32013,32013,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
Patient Costs and Physicians' Information,"Michael J. Dickstein, Jihye Jeon, Eduardo Morales","Health insurance plans in the U.S. increasingly use price mechanisms to steer demand for prescription drugs. The effectiveness of these incentives, however, depends both on physicians' price sensitivity and their knowledge of patient prices. We develop a moment inequality model that allows researchers to identify agents' preferences without fully specifying their information. Applying this model to diabetes care, we find that physicians lack detailed price information and are more price-elastic than full-information models imply. We predict that providing physicians detailed information on prices at the point of prescribing can save patients 12-23% of their out-of-pocket costs for diabetes treatment.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32014,32014,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
A Delegation Approach to Regulating Hiring Discrimination,"Paolo Martellini, Guido Menzio","We approach the design of anti-discriminatory labor market regulation as a delegation problem. A private firm (the agent) is repeatedly faced with the opportunity of hiring one among several applicants to fill its vacancies. The firm is biased against applicants from some demographic group, and it is neutral towards applicants from some other group. Applicants differ not only with respect to their demographic characteristics, but also with respect to the idiosyncratic quality of their match with firm. A benevolent and unbiased labor market authority (the principal) enacts a hiring regulation (a direct-revelation mechanism without transfers) in order to reduce the impact of the firm's bias on its hiring behavior. The hiring regulation is constrained by the fact that the quality of the match between any particular applicant and the firm is privately observed by the firm. We characterize the optimal mechanism.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32018,32018,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
The Mismeasurement of Work Time: Implications for Wage Discrimination and Inequality,"George J. Borjas, Daniel S. Hamermesh","Comparing measures of work time in the recall CPS-ASEC data with contemporaneous measures reveals many logical inconsistencies and probable errors. About 8 percent of ASEC respondents report weeks worked last year that contradict their current work histories in the Basic monthly interviews; the error rate is over 50 percent among workers who move in and out of the workforce. Over 20 percent give contradictory information about whether they usually work a full-time weekly schedule. Part of the inconsistency arises because an increasing fraction of ASEC respondents (over 20 percent by 2018) consists of people whose record was fully imputed. The levels and trends of the errors differ by gender and race, and they affect measured wage differentials between 1978 to 2018. Adjusting for the errors and imputations, gender wage gaps among all workers narrowed by 4 log points more than is commonly reported, and residual wage inequality decreased by 6 log points more. In a very carefully defined sample of full-time year-round workers, gender and racial wage differentials  narrowed slightly less than previously estimated using ASEC data, but much more than indicated by commonly used estimates from CPS Outgoing Rotation Groups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32025,32025,24-Jan,NBER,1/8/2024
"Job Loss, Credit Card Loans, and the College-persistence Decision of US Working Students",Pinghui Wu and Lucy McMillan,"This study assesses the impact of involuntary job loss on college persistence by leveraging different job-loss timings relative to a student’s college enrollment decision. We find that job loss increases the probability that a working college student leaves college before attaining a degree, but access to short-term credit through credit card loans buffers this liquidity effect. By restricting credit supply to college students, the CARD Act of 2009 has inadvertently inhibited the ability of liquidity-constrained students to remain in college when their earnings unexpectedly fall, resulting in a stronger liquidity effect of job loss on college persistence over the last decade.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/job-loss-credit-card-loans-and-the-college-persistence-decision-of-us-working-students,23-19,2-Jan-24,FED-BOSTON,1/8/2024
Occupational Licensing and Occupational Mobility,Osborne Jackson,"This paper estimates the impact of occupational licensing at the extensive margin (existence) and intensive margin (qualifications) on the occupational mobility of US workers. Using 2015–2022 Current Population Survey data on worker occupational choices matched to licensing-policy data, I show that the existence of licensing regulation significantly reduces the probability that a worker enters an occupation. This reduced mobility is largely due to licensing fees and minimum thresholds for age and education. This finding may help explain the weak relationship between licensure and product market quality, as binding licensing qualifications likely have mixed links to worker skills.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/occupational-licensing-and-occupational-mobility,23-18,8-Dec-23,FED-BOSTON,12/8/2023
Introducing Consumer Durable Digital Services into the BEA Digital Economy Satellite Account,"Benjamin R. Bridgman, Tina Highfill, Jon D. Samuels","Measuring the digital economy is a high priority for analysts of economic growth. We augment the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s Digital Economy Satellite Account to include digital services provided by high-tech consumer durables. We find that including the service flow from these goods raises the growth rate of the digital economy between 2005 and 2021 from 6.4 percent per year to 6.9 percent per year. Consumer durable services accounted for about 10 percent of digital economy GDP within augmented digital economy GDP.

Consumption Zones,"Andrea Batch, Benjamin R. Bridgman, Abe C. Dunn, Mahsa Gholizadeh","Local area data are important to many economic questions, but most local area data are reported using political units, such as counties, which often do not match economic units, such as product markets. Commuting zones (CZs) group counties into local labor markets. However, CZs are not the most appropriate grouping for other economic activities. We introduce consumption zones (ConZs), groupings of counties appropriate for the analysis of household consumption. We apply the CZ methodology to payment card data, which report spending flows across U.S. counties for 15 retail and service industries. We find that different industries have different market sizes. Grocery stores have more than five times the number of ConZs as live entertainment. Industries with more frequent purchases are more local than those with infrequent purchases. We apply ConZs to measuring industry concentration. ConZs give lower concentration levels than counties, with the largest gap for infrequent purchase industries. The difference is economically important. Some industries are below the antitrust enforcement thresholds with ConZs but above them for counties. We further demonstrate the importance of ConZs by analyzing the proposed merger of Albertsons and Kroger.",https://www.bea.gov//research/papers/2023/consumption-zones,WP2023-3,5/4/2023,BEA,5/4/2023
The Increasing Pace of Weather-Related Cost Shocks: Should Net Domestic Product be Affected by Climate Disasters?,"Brian Sliker, Leonard Nakamura","The monetary costs of weather and climate disasters in the U.S. grew rapidly from 1980 to 2022, rising more than five percent in real terms annually, and implying a faster depreciation of real assets. We argue that the expected depreciation from these events could be included in consumption of fixed capital, leading to lower levels, and slightly slower growth rates, of Net Domestic Product. We use Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood regressions to estimate this expectation and generate our experimental measure of costs. An alternative calculation of depreciation and Net Domestic Product might be derived from the time series of costs incurred, rather than the far smoother expectation. This latter, realized series might be more appropriate for a national income satellite account. We also investigate the parametric distributions of annual average and total disaster-cost data.",https://www.bea.gov//research/papers/2023/increasing-pace-weather-related-cost-shocks-should-net-domestic-product-be,WP2023-12,12/6/2023,BEA,12/6/2023
Capitalizing Data: Case Studies of Tax Forms and Individual Credit Reports,Rachel Soloveichik,"Early papers on capitalizing data focused on complex digital data that are stored on supercomputers and managed by highly skilled computer scientists (Statistics Canada 2019) (Eurostat 2020) (Coyle 2022) (Calderon and Rassier 2022) (Mitchell et al. 2022). This paper studies two very different types of data: tax forms and individual credit reports. Both types of data are simple text records that can be stored on any computer or even on paper (Brenton 1964) and managed by workers with only a high school degree (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2022a) (Weedmark 2021). Despite their simplicity, these two data types are expensive to create. This paper estimates that tax forms had a creation cost of $0.4 trillion in 2017 and individual credit reports had a creation cost of $0.6 trillion in 2017.Historical growth changes noticeably when tax forms and individual credit reports are tracked as long-lived intangible assets. Tax form creation rose rapidly between 1929 and 1950 due to the introduction of Social Security and widespread federal income taxes. As a result, including tax forms increases real gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 1929 and 1950 by 0.12 percentage point per year. In contrast, real credit report creation plummeted in 1970 due to the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). As a result, including individual credit reports decreases real GDP growth in 1970 by 1.6 percentage point. However, neither tax forms nor individual credit reports have much impact on recent GDP growth.",https://www.bea.gov//research/papers/2023/capitalizing-data-case-studies-tax-forms-and-individual-credit-reports,WP2023-7,6/21/2023,BEA,6/21/2023
Experimental Ultimate Host Economy Statistics for U.S. Direct Investment Abroad,"Kirsten Brew, Jessica Hanson, Ricardo Limés, Ryan Smith, Larkin Terrie","Following international guidelines, BEA statistics on bilateral U.S. direct investment abroad are compiled and presented by immediate partner economy. While this approach is well suited for many purposes, it can lead to difficulty in interpreting direct investment statistics, especially in identifying the economies that are the ultimate destinations, or hosts, of direct investment. BEA’s initial effort to produce U.S. direct investment abroad statistics by ultimate host economy (UHE), described in this paper, focused on producing statistics on equity position by UHE using six different methods to reallocate the equity position by immediate host economy. The methods are implemented using direct investment data reported on BEA’s Quarterly Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad and activities of multinational enterprises data reported on BEA’s Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad.

"Measuring Digital Intermediation Services: Experimental Estimates of Gross Output for Rideshare, Travel Services, and Food/Grocery Delivery Service Platforms","Tina Highfill, Brian Quistorff","The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) produces economic statistics through its system of satellite accounts that highlight specialized areas of the economy that are not directly apparent in BEA’s official economic statistics published under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), such as outdoor recreation and arts and culture. BEA recently developed a Digital Economy Satellite Account (DESA) to better understand this area of the economy as it involves production that spans multiple NAICS industries, ranging from computer manufacturing to internet-based retail trade (e-commerce) to software production. Currently, BEA’s digital economy statistics do not fully capture production of digital intermediary services earned from operating a digital platform that facilitates the direct interaction between multiple buyers and multiple sellers for a fee (such as rideshare), resulting in an incomplete picture of the digital economy. In this paper, we discuss options for measuring digital intermediary services across selected industries of interest to other international statistical agencies as well as BEA: rideshare, travel services, and food/grocery delivery services. We also provide experimental estimates of gross output for these services that cover 2018–2021 using two approaches. We find that digital intermediation services for rideshare, travel services, and food/grocery delivery services represented at least $31 billion in 2021 gross output, or close to 1 percent of the overall value of the digital economy based on the latest DESA statistics.",https://www.bea.gov//research/papers/2023/measuring-digital-intermediation-services-experimental-estimates-gross-output,WP2023-8,10/10/2023,BEA,10/10/2023

For What It’s Worth: Measuring Land Value in the Era of Big Data and Machine Learning,"Scott Wentland, Gary Cornwall, Jeremy G. Moulton","This paper develops a new method for valuing land, a key asset on a nation’s balance sheet. The method first employs an unsupervised machine learning method, kmeans clustering, to discretize unobserved heterogeneity, which we then combine with a supervised learning algorithm, gradient boosted trees (GBT), to obtain property-level price predictions and estimates of the land component. Our initial results from a large national dataset show this approach routinely outperforms hedonic regression methods (as used by the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics, for example) in out-of-sample price predictions. To exploit the best of both methods, we further explore a composite approach using model stacking, finding it outperforms all methods in out-of-sample tests and a benchmark test against nearby vacant land sales. In an application, we value residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural land for the entire contiguous U.S. from 2006-2015. The results offer new insights into valuation and demonstrate how a unified method can build national and subnational estimates of land value from detailed, parcel-level data.

A Direct Measure of Medical Innovation on Health Care Spending: A Condition-Specific Approach,"Abe C.

"Marketing, Other Intangibles, and Output Growth in 61 United States Industries","Leo Sveikauskas, Rachel Soloveichik, Corby Garner, Peter B. Meyer, James Bessen, Mathew Russell","Experts in the System of National Accounts (SNA) recently considered whether marketing could be included as a capital asset in the national accounts and later recommended that marketing should be an intangible in the 2025 SNA (IMF, 2022; IMF, 2023). This paper contributes to that discussion by developing macroeconomic measures of marketing investments and stocks for the United States. We also construct and analyze measures of how marketing and other intangibles contribute to output growth in the 61 industries that comprise the U.S. private business sector.We find that marketing contributes approximately as much to output growth as software and R&D (research and development) do. From 1987 to 2020, our preferred estimates of the annual contribution to output growth are 0.15 percentage point for R&D, 0.19 for software, and 0.18 for marketing. Software grows more rapidly, whereas marketing has a larger factor share. Marketing contributes even more to output if quality is adjusted to allow for better targeting associated with digital advertising. There is a close relationship between data flows, software, and digital marketing, and national accountants must allocate expenditures among these categories.Background DataMarketing Asset DetailXLSXMarketing Prices for SubmissionXLSXOwn-Account Marketing for SubmissionXLSXPurchased and Inhouse Marketing for SubmissionXLSX",https://www.bea.gov//research/papers/2023/marketing-other-intangibles-and-output-growth-61-united-states-industries,WP2023-11,10/31/2023,BEA,10/31/2023
What drives core inflation? The role of supply shocks,"Marta Bańbura, Elena Bobeica, Catalina Martínez Hernández","We propose a framework to identify a rich set of structural drivers of inflation in order to understand the role of the multiple and concomitant sources of the post-pandemic inflation surge. We specify a medium-sized structural Bayesian VAR on a comprehensive set of variables for the euro area economy. We analyse in particular various types of supply shocks, some of which were not considered relevant before the pandemic, notably global supply chain shocks and gas price shocks. The residuals of the VAR are assumed to admit a factor structure and the shocks are identified via zero and sign restrictions on factor loadings. The framework can deal with ragged-edge data and extreme observations. Shocks linked to global supply chains and to gas prices have exhibited a much larger influence than in the past. Overall, supply shocks can explain the bulk of the post-pandemic inflation surge, also for core inflation. Being able to gauge the impact of such shocks is useful for policy making. We show that a counterfactual core inflation measure net of energy and global supply chain shocks has been more stable after the pandemic.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2875~e585ae652b.en.pdf?f85a8b326ab051060796d6b29cd8a9d1,2875,16-Nov-23,ECB,11/16/2023
Do debt investors care about ESG ratings?,"Kornelia Fabisik, Michael Ryf, Larissa Schäfer, Sascha Steffen","We study the effect of changes in firms’ ESG ratings on the cost of debt of U.S. firms using a methodology change of an ESG rating provider. We find that loan spreads of downgraded ESG-rated firms in the secondary corporate loan market increase by about 10% compared to non-downgraded ESG-rated firms after the methodology change. The effect of ESG rating downgrades is not driven by the increase in the fundamental default risk of firms but rather by the premium charged by investors above the spread for default risk. The effect is stronger for firms that are more financially constrained, firms that are more exposed to ESG and, particularly, climate risk concerns as well as firms that are more held by climate-concerned lenders. We show that also loan spreads of private (unrated) firms in industries affected by ESG rating downgrades increase after the methodology change.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2878~084d57bc4d.en.pdf?85c5710707360da0be01282b5019dfac,2878,24-Nov-23,ECB,11/24/2023
On the estimation of distributional household wealth: addressing under-reporting via optimization problems with invariant Gini coefficient,"Janina Engel, Dennis Ohlwerter, Matthias Scherer","The Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) provides valuable information for the monetary policy and financial stability purposes. The dataset shows, however, inconsistencies with National Account (NtlA) statistics, as the aggregated HFCS micro data do usually not match the corresponding NtlA macro data. Therefore, we suggest a solution to close the gap via an optimization problem that aims at preserving for each wealth instrument the level of inequality measured by the Gini coefficient. In addition, a lower and an upper bound of inequality are derived, that can be reached by extreme allocations of the wealth discrepancies across the households. Finally, based on the German HFCS, we compare the findings with another approach suggested in the literature that uses a “multivariate calibration”. The comparison indicates that the multivariate calibration may reallocate households’ wealth beyond the observed discrepancies, thereby leading to Gini coefficients that exceed the analytically derived upper bound of inequality.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2865~2c76fbb179.en.pdf?781d771f6fc810cb59b54f01f9870889,2865,6-Nov-23,ECB,11/6/2023
Monetary/fiscal policy regimes in post-war Europe,"Othman Bouabdallah, Pascal Jacquinot, Valeria Patella","In most euro area countries, the monetary/fiscal policy mix is responsible for the changing history of debt and inflation facts. Using a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model with Markov-switching policy rules, we identify three distinct monetary/fiscal regimes in France and Italy: a Passive Monetary-Active Fiscal regime (PM/AF) before the late 80s/early 90s; an Active Monetary-Passive Fiscal regime (AM/PF) with central bank independence and EMU convergence; a third regime with policy rates at the effective lower bound combined with fiscal active behavior to sustain the recovery. Our simulations reveal that the PM/AF regime in France led to price volatility and debt stabilisation, while the AM/PF regime resulted in disinflation and rising debt trajectory. Meanwhile, Italy’s procyclical fiscal policy in downturns contributed to persisting imbalances, high aggregate volatility, and low growth.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2871~2f10ce452d.en.pdf?2bc9de5bd8206b8e3f93a64e2576877d,2871,9-Nov-23,ECB,11/9/2023

A deep dive into the capital channel of risk sharing in the euro area,"Natalia Martín Fuentes, Alexandra Born, Franziska Bremus, Wieger Kastelein, Claudia Lambert","This paper investigates the contribution of capital markets to international risk sharing in the euro area over the 2000Q1-2021Q1 period. It provides three main contributions: First, the estimation of country-specific vector autoregressions (VAR) shows that shock absorption through capital markets remains modest, particularly in the southern euro area. Second, we analyse the geographical patterns of the capital channel. While risk sharing between southern and northern euro area countries led the improvements in income smoothing at the beginning of the 2000s, intra-regional capital flows supported income smoothing in the recent past. Third, based on a panel threshold VAR, we analyse how the composition of external capital positions impacts the capital channel. Long-term portfolio debt assets and liabilities as well as equity liabilities significantly improved income smoothing. The effect is more pronounced for northern countries, in line with their larger cross-border portfolios, when compared to the southern countries. Regarding foreign direct investment, only northern countries benefited from inward positions.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2864~bc6d7b989f.en.pdf?d0fd1a1e0e6260469b2e484b020ffa02,2864,6-Nov-23,ECB,11/6/2023
The bright side of the doom loop: banks’ sovereign exposure and default incentives,"Luis E. Rojas, Dominik Thaler","The feedback loop between sovereign and financial sector insolvency has been identified as a key driver of the European debt crisis and has motivated an array of policy proposals. We revisit this “doom loop” focusing on governments’ incentives to default. To this end, we present a simple 3-period model with strategic sovereign default, where debt is held by domestic banks and foreign investors. The government maximizes domestic welfare, and thus the temptation to default increases with externally-held debt. Importantly, the costs of default arise endogenously from the damage that default causes to domestic banks’ balance sheets. Domestically-held debt thus serves as a commitment device for the government. We show that two prominent policy prescriptions – lower exposure of banks to domestic sovereign debt or a commitment not to bailout banks – can backfire, since default incentives depend not only on the quantity of debt, but also on who holds it. Conversely, allowing banks to buy additional sovereign debt in times of sovereign distress can avert the doom loop. In an extension we show that in the context of a monetary union (such as the euro area) similar unintended negative consequences may arise from the pooling of debt (such as European safe bond aka. ESBies). A backstop by the central bank (such as the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument) can successfully disable the loop if precisely calibrated.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2869~83394dbfea.en.pdf?6007176d2b9d32db6f784d4e28156d26,2869,8-Nov-23,ECB,11/8/2023

US monetary policy spillovers to European banks,Alexander Jung,"The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy announcements have created massive spillovers to global financial markets. Based on daily data for the sample from 1999 to 2019, this study finds that the Fed’s monetary policy announcements created significant international spillovers to bond yields and stock prices of European banks and non-financial corporations (NFCs), while changes in uncertainty around the expected Fed policy path and Fed information effects constituted critical additional dimensions of these spillover effects. International spillovers to bond yields of banks and NFCs were similar, while stock prices of European banks responded somewhat stronger than those of NFCs. The significant spillovers from the Fed’s forward guidance to European bond yields show that central bank communication is very relevant for international transmission. In relation to earlier studies emphasizing strong QE-related spillovers, this study suggests that Fed QE announcements created only small spillovers on bond yields and stock prices of European banks and NFCs.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2876~4bfa61fd60.en.pdf?fe4c9fc95710a2da9b411516d7739712,2876,17-Nov-23,ECB,11/17/2023
“Glossy green” banks: the disconnect between environmental disclosures and lending activities,"Mariassunta Giannetti, Martina Jasova, Maria Loumioti, Caterina Mendicino","Using confidential information on banks’ portfolios, inaccessible to market participants, we show that banks that emphasize the environment in their disclosures extend a higher volume of credit to brown borrowers, without charging higher interest rates or shortening debt maturity. These results cannot be attributed to the financing of borrowers’ transition towards greener technologies and are robust to controlling for banks’ climate risk discussions. Examining the mechanisms behind the strategic disclosure choices, we highlight that banks are hesitant to sever ties with existing brown borrowers, especially if they exhibit financial underperformance.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2882~28386e3a49.en.pdf?b21dc32e12bda1fa481d0649acfb33c6,2882,18-Dec-23,ECB,12/18/2023
Financial contagion within the interbank network,"Christina D. Mikropoulou, Angelos T. Vouldis","The analysis of contagion in financial networks has primarily focused on transmission channels operating through direct linkages. This paper develops a model of financial contagion in the interbank market featuring both direct and indirect transmission mechanisms. The model is used to analyse how shocks originating from outside sectors impact the functioning of the interbank market and investigates the emergence of instability in this setting. We conduct simulations on actual interbank bilateral exposures, constructed manually from a supervisory dataset reported by the largest euro area banks. We find that while the impact of direct contagion increases gradually with the shock intensity, the effect of indirect contagion is subject to threshold effects and can increase abruptly when the threshold is exceeded. In addition, the risk posed by indirect contagion has a higher upper bound compared to direct contagion. Finally, we find that in terms of overall impact, the shocks to the value of sovereign debt and non-bank financial institutions represent the most significant risk to the functioning of the interbank market.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2883~47e3ebe468.en.pdf?20be3ab47f51e49196debcf9f2e90488,2883,18-Dec-23,ECB,12/18/2023
Fund fragility: the role of investor base,"Nolwenn Allaire, Johannes Breckenfelder, Marie Hoerova","Using security-by-security data on investor holdings in the euro area, we study run dynamics across different fund-shares of the same fund during the unprecedented liquidity crisis in March 2020. For an average bond or equity mutual fund-share, households, other euro area funds, and the foreign sector each represent about a quarter of the total holdings. Insurance companies hold another 14%, with all other investors combined (banks, non-financial corporations, pension funds, etc.) accounting for less than 10% of holdings. Analyzing bond funds, we show that fund-shares with higher ownership by other funds suffered substantially higher outflows (by 6 percentage points), while fund-shares with higher ownership by households had substantially lower outflows (by 5 percentage points) compared to the other fund-shares within the same fund. This gap is not driven by time-varying differences in fund performance. Results for equity funds are similar, although they faced substantially smaller outflows, coupled with much larger declines in performance, compared to bond funds. Our findings suggest that a collective “dash for cash” by consumers and firms in need of liquidity at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic was not the source of mutual fund fragility. Instead, the most run-prone investor type turned out to be the fund sector itself.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2874~af5c7c3678.en.pdf?dd12bcb5085c976c78c68a4f6ebc08b9,2874,14-Nov-23,ECB,11/14/2023
Do banks practice what they preach? Brown lending and environmental disclosure in the euro area,"Leonardo Gambacorta, Salvatore Polizzi, Alessio Reghezza, Enzo Scannella","This study examines whether the level of environmental disclosure in banks’ financial reports matches less brown lending portfolios. Using granular credit register data and detailed information on firm-level greenhouse gas emission intensities, we find a negative relationship between environmental disclosure and brown lending. However, this effect is contingent on the tone of the financial report. Banks that express a negative tone, reflecting genuine concern and awareness of environmental risks, tend to lend less to more polluting firms. Conversely, banks that express a positive tone, indicating lower concern and awareness of environmental risks, tend to lend more to polluting firms. These findings highlight the importance of increasing awareness of environmental risks, so that banks perceive them as a critical and urgent pressing threat, leading to a genuine commitment to act as environmentally responsible lenders.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2872~b91ebffb71.en.pdf?b21c1346272b8634718a98691ff7b90f,2872,10-Nov-23,ECB,11/10/2023
Inflation and fiscal policy: is there a threshold effect in the fiscal reaction function?,"Clémence Briodeau, Cristina Checherita-Westphal","This paper estimates a fiscal reaction function (FRF) framework for euro area countries to test for the impact of changes in inflation on fiscal policy. We find evidence of non-linear short-term effects of HICP inflation on the primary balance after controlling for other relevant factors. Over the period 1999-2022, we unveil an inverse U-turn relationship and an inflation turning point - beyond which its short-term (contemporaneous) impact on the primary balance starts being negative - at somewhat above 4% for the sample of mature euro area economies (EA-12, first twelve EA members) and around 6% for the whole sample of euro area countries in 2022 (EA-19). Using an alternative measure of “inflation surprise” (available for the period 2003-2022) yields robust results in the larger EA-19 sample and lowers the threshold to just below 5%. In terms of channels, the non-linear effects are found to propagate through both the primary expenditure and the revenue ratio (more robustly through the former) in the EA-12 sample, while only the combined effect on the primary balance seems to prevail for EA-19. These results reflect primarily the most recent high inflation episode and indicate that in such conditions inflation can be costly for public finance flows even in the shorter run.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2880~c8663668e0.en.pdf?473a4c18ea0fee5b18b1e9b101f042b7,2880,5-Dec-23,ECB,12/5/2023
Financial stability considerations in the conduct of monetary policy,"Paul Bochmann, Daniel Dieckelmann, Stephan Fahr, Josef Ruzicka","We empirically analyze the interaction of monetary policy with financial stability and the real economy in the euro area. For this, we apply a quantile vector autoregressive model and two alternative estimation approaches: simulation and local projections. Our specifications include monetary policy surprises, real GDP, inflation, financial vulnerabilities and systemic financial stress. We disentangle conventional and unconventional monetary policy by separating interest rate surprises into two factors that move the yield curve either at the short end or at the long end. Our results show that a build-up of financial vulnerabilities tends to be accompanied initially by subdued financial stress which resurges, however, over a medium-term horizon, harming economic growth.

Loss sharing in central clearinghouses: winners and losers,"Christian Kubitza, Loriana Pelizzon, Mila Getmansky Sherman","Central clearing counterparties (CCPs) were established to mitigate default losses resulting from counterparty risk in derivatives markets. In a parsimonious model, we show that clearing benefits are distributed unevenly across market participants. Loss sharing rules determine who wins or loses from clearing. Current rules disproportionately benefit market participants with flat portfolios. Instead, those with directional portfolios are relatively worse off, consistent with their reluctance to voluntarily use central clearing. Alternative loss sharing rules can address cross-sectional disparities in clearing benefits. However, we show that CCPs may favor current rules to maximize fee income, with externalities on clearing participation.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2873~8ad2dc489a.en.pdf?73348a845dba7f25a1ace7cb419c5fa4,2873,14-Nov-23,ECB,11/14/2023
Global spillovers from multi-dimensional US monetary policy,"Georgios Georgiadis, Marek Jarociński","We estimate spillovers from US monetary policy for different measures in the Federal Reserve’s toolkit. We make use of novel measures of exogenous variation in conventional rate policy, forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) based on high-frequency asset-price surprises around Federal Open Market Committee meetings. The identification relies on relatively weak assumptions and accounts for the possible presence of residual endogenous components—such as central bank information effects—in these monetary policy surprises. We find that: (i) forward guidance and LSAPs trigger much larger spillovers than conventional rate policy; (ii) spillovers transmit predominantly through financial channels centering on global investors’ risk appetite and manifest in changes in equity prices, bond spreads, capital flows and the dollar exchange rate; (iii) LSAPs trigger immediate international portfolio re-balancing between US and advanced-economy bonds, but generally entail only rather limited term premium spillovers;(iv) both forward guidance and LSAPs entail trade-offs for emerging-market-economy central banks, either between stabilizing output and prices or between additionally ensuring financial stability in terms of capital inflows.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2881~a2c5c8070a.en.pdf?2b1e4e1086b6dab3280a0feba0de5e6e,2881,5-Dec-23,ECB,12/5/2023
Who bears the costs of inflation? Euro area households and the 2021–2022 shock,"Filippo Pallotti, Gonzalo Paz-Pardo, Jiri Slacalek, Oreste Tristani, Giovanni L. Violante","We measure the heterogeneous welfare effects of the recent inflation surge across households in the Euro Area. A simple framework illustrating the numerous channels of the transmission mechanism of surprise inflation to household welfare guides our empirical exercise. By combining micro data and aggregate time series, we conclude that: (i) country-level average welfare costs –expressed as a share of 2021–22 income– were larger than a typical recession, and heterogeneous, e.g., 3% in France and 8% in Italy; (ii) this inflation episode resembles an age-dependent tax, with the elderly losing up to 20%, and roughly half of the 25–44 year-old winning; (iii) losses were quite uniform across consumption quantiles because rigid rents served as a hedge for the poor; (iv) nominal net positions are the key driver of heterogeneity across-households; (v) the rise in energy prices generated vast variation in individual-level inflation rates, but unconventional fiscal policies were critical in shielding the most vulnerable households.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2877~698cc193b0.en.pdf?a2f23a2307e8083a3fa1beadb61ad281,2877,21-Nov-23,ECB,11/21/2023
The effects of labor income risk heterogeneity on the marginal propensity to consume,Ettore Savoia,"Using detailed micro-data, this paper documents that households with lower income risk (and higher income levels) exhibit a higher Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) in response to transitory income shocks, all else being equal. This finding is particularly significant among unconstrained households and supported by models with precautionary saving only if designed to account for the empirically observed negative correlation between income levels and income risk. This interaction generates saving dynamics such that the stationary distribution of wealth among households facing different risk levels is not polarized.Therefore, it is possible to compare their respective MPCs within wealth and identify the reduction in MPC due to labor income risk. Otherwise, the effects of income risk are masked by wealth effects. In neither case, the MPC depends on (permanent, persistent, or current) income levels, whose direct effect on the MPC is always ambiguous. Finally, simulations of targeted fiscal rebates for specific labor categories reveal that governments cannot simultaneously stimulate aggregate demand and mitigate income risk.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2866~a11841e627.en.pdf?e27e8b262c477eb3434f0bd4764d3f29,2866,7-Nov-23,ECB,11/7/2023
Global and local drivers of Bitcoin trading vis-à-vis fiat currencies,"Paola Di Casola, Maurizio Michael Habib, David Tercero-Lucas","We analyse the drivers of Bitcoin transactions against 44 fiat currencies in the largest peer-to-peer crypto exchanges. Momentum and volatility in the cryptoasset market, as well as volatility and liquidity in global financial markets do matter for Bitcoin trading. There is suggestive evidence of a global crypto cycle driven by speculative motives. However, in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs), Bitcoin seems to offer also transactional benefits, since trading increases when the value of the domestic currency is unstable. Proxies of banking depth and digitalisation are negatively correlated with the currency loadings on the global factor, indicating that crypto-assets may offer a speculative alternative to traditional finance when this is not available, especially in EMDEs where the share of younger risk-prone population is higher. Our results clearly point to potential financial stability risks from cryptoisation in EMDEs with low levels of financial development and unstable fiat currencies.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2868~0c2ad2e6e7.en.pdf?d6c30bb110bfb610a1f23569a7bc920c,2868,8-Nov-23,ECB,11/8/2023
"Monetary Tightening, Inflation Drivers and Financial Stress","Frederic Boissay, Fabrice Collard, Cristina Manea, Adam Shapiro","The paper explores the state–dependent effects of a monetary tightening on financial stress, focusing on a novel dimension: the nature of supply versus demand inflation at the time of policy rate hikes. We use local projections to estimate the effect of high frequency identified monetary policy surprises on a variety of financial stress measures, differentiating the effects based on whether inflation is supply–driven (e.g. due to adverse supply or cost–push shocks) or demand–driven (e.g. due to positive demand factors). We find that financial stress flares up after a policy rate hike when inflation is supply–driven, but it remains roughly unchanged, or even declines when inflation is demand–driven. Our findings point to a particular tension between price stability and financial stability when inflation is high and largely supply–driven.",https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/working-papers/2023/38/,2023-38,12/1/2023,FED-SANFRANCISCO,1/8/2024

Vavra","There are large cross-sectional differences in how often US borrowers refinance mortgages. In this paper, we develop an equilibrium mortgage pricing model with heterogeneous borrowers and use it to show that equilibrium forces imply important cross-subsidies from borrowers who rarely refinance to those who refinance often. Mortgage reforms can potentially reduce these regressive cross-subsidies, but the equilibrium effects of these reforms can also have important distributional consequences. For example, many policies that lead to more frequent refinancing also increase equilibrium mortgage rates and thus reduce residential mortgage credit access for a large number of borrowers.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/refinancing-frictions-mortgage-pricing-and-redistribution/,2024-3,8-Jan-24,BFI,1/8/2024
Dynamic carbon emission management,"Maria Cecilia Bustamante, Francesca Zucchi","The control of carbon emissions by policymakers poses the corporate challenge of developing an optimal carbon management policy. We provide a unified model that characterizes how firms should optimally manage emissions through production, green investment, and the trading of carbon credits. We show that carbon pricing reduces firms’ emissions but also induces firms to tilt towards more immediate yet transient types of green investment—such as abatement as opposed to innovation—as it becomes costlier to comply. Green innovation subsidies mitigate this effect and complement carbon pricing in ensuring innovation-driven sustainability. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that carbon regulation need not reduce firm value.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2885~f79eb3dbc6.en.pdf?42eb71897ab13a34044238e58350d8d4,2885,10-Jan-24,ECB,1/11/2024

How Do Consumers Use Firm Disclosure? Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment,"Sinja Leonelli, Maximilian Muhn, Thomas Rauter, Gurpal Sran","We combine a large-scale field experiment with a customized survey to study whether and how consumers use firm disclosure. In a sample of more than 24,000 U.S. households, we first establish several stylized facts: (i) the average consumer has a moderate preference to purchase from ESG-responsible firms; (ii) consumers typically have no preference for more or less profitable firms; (iii) consumers rarely consult ESG reports and virtually never use financial reports to inform their purchase decisions. In our field experiment, we then inform households about real firm-disclosed profitability and ESG activities through seven randomized information treatments. Consumers increase their purchase intent when exogenously presented with firm-disclosed positive signals about environmental, social, and—to a lesser extent—governance activities. Full ESG reports only have an impact on consumers who choose to view them, whereas financial reports and earnings information do not have an effect. After the experiment, consumers increase their actual product purchases, but these effects are small, short-lived, and only materialize for viewed ESG reports and positive social signals. Through a follow-up survey, we provide explanations for why consumers (do not) change their shopping behavior after our information experiment.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/how-do-consumers-use-firm-disclosure-evidence-from-a-randomized-field-experiment/,4/1/2024,9-Jan-24,BFI,1/11/2024
Market power in banking,"Elena Carletti, Agnese Leonello, Robert Marquez","Bank market power, both in the loan and deposit market, has important implications for credit provision and for financial stability.

This structure allows us to review the literature on the role of market power for credit provision and stability and also highlight the interactions between the two sides of banks’ balance sheets.

We find that incorporating “robot'' capital into the model does make a big difference to policy outcomes: the trickle-down effects of corporate tax cuts on unskilled wages are attenuated, and the advantages of investment in infrastructure, and especially in education, are bigger. Based on our calibrations grounded on new empirical estimates, infrastructure investment and corporate tax cuts dominate investment in education in a ""traditional"" economy. However, in an economy with “robots” the infrastructure investment dominates corporate tax cuts, while investment in education tends to produce the highest welfare gains of all.

We employ a deterministic, overlapping generations model with two assets and no risk of default. The two assets are public debt and private (productive) capital. We assume that the return on private capital equals the interest rate on public debt plus an exogenously given spread. Employing a analytical version of the model we show an example in which a permanent rise in the public debt ratio leads to a significant reduction in steady-state GDP even as r",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/12/Costly-Increases-in-Public-Debt-when-r-g-543718,WPIEA2024010,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/13/2024
What Caused the Beveridge Curve to Shift Higher in the United States During the Pandemic?,"Gene Kindberg-Hanlon, Michael Girard","The Beveridge curve shifted substantially higher in the United States following the start of the COVID pandemic. In 2022, vacancies reached record highs across all sectors while unemployment fell to pre-pandemic lows. At the same time, the pandemic has resulted in severe labor shortages, and we estimate that the labor force was approximately 2 million below trend at the start of 2023. We exploit state-level data in the United States to find that lower immigration, higher excess mortality due to COVID, and falling older-worker labor force participation were associated with larger upward shifts in the Beveridge curve. We also find that states that had a larger employment concentration in contact-intensive sectors had larger upward shifts in their Beveridge curve. While the effect of sectoral reallocation and rehiring has been shown in theoretical models to lift the Beveridge curve, we show that worker shortages also result in an upward shift in the Beveridge curve if they increase the marginal product of labor. This result holds in a search and matching model with on-the-job search, but does not hold without on-the-job search.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/12/What-Caused-the-Beveridge-Curve-to-Shift-Higher-in-the-United-States-During-the-Pandemic-542870,WPIEA2024008,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/13/2024
Digitalization and Employment Gender Gaps During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Latin America,"Yuanchen Yang, Manuk Ghazanchyan, Silvia Granados-Ibarra, Gustavo Canavire-Bacarreza","Despite its negative effects, the COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated Latin America's digitalization. The rapid increase in connectivity and digital services was helpful in mitigating the pandemic's negative impact on the labor markets, especially for those with enough flexibility to continue working from home. The shock has particularly affected women due to their household responsibilities and labor market characteristics. This paper examines how digitalization may have affected gender gaps in employment and job loss related to the COVID-19 crisis. Using a sample of Latin American countries, our findings suggest that higher levels of digitalization are associated with increased female employment and reduced job loss for both men and women. These findings hold even after controlling for factors such as child care, household chores, and the COVID-19 shock. Our results are also robust to various econometric techniques.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/12/Digitalization-and-Employment-Gender-Gaps-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-Evidence-from-Latin-543709,WPIEA2024012,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/13/2024
Dissecting the Decline in Average Hours Worked in Europe,"Diva Astinova, Romain A Duval, Niels-Jakob H Hansen, Ben Park, Ippei Shibata, Frederik G Toscani","Three years after the COVID-19 crisis, employment and total hours worked in Europe fully recovered, but average hours per worker did not. We analyze the decline in average hours worked across European countries and find that (i) it is not cyclical but predominantly structural, extending a long-term trend that predates COVID-19, (ii) it mainly reflects reduced hours within worker groups, not a compositional shift towards lower-hours jobs and workers, (iii) men—particularly those with young children—and youth drive this drop, (iv) declines in actual hours match declines in desired hours. Policy reforms could help involuntary parttimers and women with young children raise their actual hours towards desired levels, but the aggregate impact on average hours would be limited to 0.5 to 1.5 percent.

In a standard overlapping generations model without such transfers, improvements in automation technologies that would lower welfare can be mitigated by shifts in labor supply related to demographics or pandemics. With perfect intergenerational transfers based on altruism, automation could raise the well-being of all generations.

Stated Preference Estimates of the Average Social Cost of Carbon,"Matthew Ashenfarb, Matthew Kotchen","This paper provides stated preference (SP) estimates of the average social cost of carbon (ASCC) for use in evaluation of the benefits and costs of climate policy. Based on a U.S. nationally representative survey, we find an average individual willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $1,116 per year to keep global warming less than 2°C by 2100 compared to a business-as-usual temperature change. Combining the WTP estimate with population projections and assessments of the required emission reductions, we find a domestic ASCC of $8 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2). Applying a benefits transfer approach to infer WTP in other countries, we obtain an estimate of the global ASCC of $39 per tonne, with a 95-percent confidence interval of $32-$48. The estimate is insensitive to the discount rate, but it does vary with assumptions about the income elasticity of WTP and the rate of change in marginal abatement costs. Reasonable scenarios create a range of estimates between $12-$118 per tonne. We also examine the impact of distributional weighting based on the elasticity of the marginal utility of income, providing distributionally-weighted estimates of the global ASCC for use in all countries. We argue that a SP estimate of the ASCC is an useful complement to existing estimates of the marginal social cost of carbon (SCC) based on different valuation approaches.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32043,32043,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
What Works and For Whom? Effectiveness and Efficiency of School Capital Investments Across The U.S.,"Barbara Biasi, Julien M. Lafortune, David Schönholzer","This paper identifies which investments in school facilities help students and are valued by homeowners. Using novel data on school district bonds, test scores, and house prices for 29 U.S. states and a research design that exploits close elections with staggered timing, we show that increased school capital spending raises test scores and house prices on average. However, impacts differ vastly across types of funded projects. Spending on basic infrastructure (such as HVAC) or on the removal of pollutants raises test scores but not house prices; conversely, spending on athletic facilities raises house prices but not test scores. Socio-economically disadvantaged districts benefit more from capital outlays, even conditioning on project type and the existing capital stock. Our estimates suggest that closing the spending gap between high- and low-SES districts and targeting spending towards high-impact projects may close as much as 25% of the observed achievement gap between these districts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32040,32040,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Uncertainty and Individual Discretion in Allocating Research Funds,"Anna Goldstein, Michael Kearney","There is a long-standing tradition in public research funding agencies of distributing funds via peer review, which aggregates evaluations of proposed research ideas from a group of external experts. Despite complaints that this process is biased against novel ideas, there is poor understanding of an alternative system that may overcome this bias: the use of individual discretion. Here, we conduct the first quantitative study of how individual discretion affects a research funding portfolio. Using internal project selection data from the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), we describe how a portfolio of projects selected by individual discretion differs from a portfolio of projects selected by traditional peer review. We show that ARPA-E program directors tend to fund proposals with greater disagreement among experts, and they also appear to prefer proposals described in reviewer comments as “creative.” These choices do not result in a significant tradeoff with short-term project performance, and they enable ARPA-E to fund more uncertain and creative research ideas, which supports the agency’s mission of pursuing novel ideas for transformational energy technology.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32033,32033,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Monetary-fiscal policy interactions when price stability occasionally takes a back seat,Sebastian Schmidt,"What are the macroeconomic consequences of a government that is limited in its willingness or ability to raise primary surpluses, and a central bank that accommodates its interest-rate policy to the fiscal conditions? I address this question in a dynamic stochastic sticky-price model with endogenous shifts between an “orthodox” and a “fiscally-dominant” policy regime. The risk of future regime shifts has encompassing effects on equilibrium. Inflation is systematically higher than it would be if fiscal policy always adjusted its primary surplus sufficiently and monetary policy was solely concerned with price stability. This inflation bias is increasing in the real value of government debt. Regime-switching probabilities are not invariant to policy. The central bank can attenuate the risk of a shift to the fiscally-dominant regime by raising the real interest rate sufficiently moderately when inflation increases. Lower fiscal dominance risk, in turn, mitigates the inflation bias.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2889~b14c2f4ff1.en.pdf?a9dcca2393ecfb37818e4298f96143f5,2889,16-Jan-24,ECB,1/16/2024
Local Variation in Onsite Work during the Pandemic and its Aftermath,"Katharine G. Abraham, Mohammad Ashoori, Aref Darzi, Nathalie Gonzalez-Prieto, John C. Haltiwanger, Aliakbar Kabiri, Erkut Y. Ozbay","Using longitudinal data on the location of mobile devices, we provide new evidence on the evolution of onsite work (OSW) over the course of the pandemic and its aftermath. We start with a large sample of individuals who, based on their mobile device activity, had a job at which they worked onsite in February 2020. We track the evolution of these individuals’ onsite work activity over the following thirteen to fourteen months, observing them in May 2020, August 2020, November 2020 and March/April 2021. Consistent with other evidence, we find a dramatic decline in OSW in May 2020 followed by a substantial rebound by the spring of 2021, albeit to a lower level than in February 2020. We document considerable cross-state, cross-city and cross-county variation in OSW. We also find, however, that the tract-level variation in OSW within states, cities and even counties far exceeds the variation across larger geographic areas. Observable characteristics such as industry, occupation, education and income account for much of the variation in OSW across large geographic areas since the pandemic. These same variables account for much of the enormous cross-tract variation in OSW that remains after controlling for state or county, but more than half of the cross-tract variation is accounted for by residual factors. These findings imply considerable heterogeneity in how the pandemic has affected where the resident populations of U.S. neighborhoods spend their days, a finding that has significant implications for businesses, workers, and policymakers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32042,32042,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Central bank digital currency: when price and bank stability collide,"Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Linda Schilling, Harald Uhlig","This paper shows the existence of a central bank trilemma. When a central bank is involved in financial intermediation, either directly through a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or indirectly through other policy instruments, it can only achieve at most two of three objectives: a socially eÿcient allocation, financial stability (i.e., absence of runs), and price stability. In particular, a commitment to price stability can cause a run on the central bank. Implementation of the socially optimal allocation requires a commitment to inflation. We illustrate this idea through a nominal version of the Diamond and Dybvig (1983) model. Our perspective may be particularly appropriate when CBDCs are introduced on a wide scale.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2888~a557bfafbb.en.pdf?067788a327b36dc17a397fa849c3c0ed,2888,15-Jan-24,ECB,1/16/2024
Homeward Bound: How Migrants Seek Out Familiar Climates,"Marguerite Obolensky, Marco Tabellini, Charles Taylor","This paper introduces the concept of “climate matching” as a driver of migration and establishes several new results. First, we show that climate strongly predicts the spatial distribution of immigrants in the US, both historically (1880) and more recently (2015), whereby movers select destinations with climates similar to their place of origin. Second, we analyze historical flows of German, Norwegian, and domestic migrants in the US and document that climate sorting also holds within countries. Third, we exploit variation in the long-run change in average US climate from 1900 to 2019 and find that migration increased more between locations whose climate converged. Fourth, we verify that results are not driven by the persistence of ethnic networks or other confounders, and provide evidence for two complementary mechanisms: climate-specific human capital and climate as amenity. Fifth, we back out the value of climate similarity by: i) exploiting the Homestead Act, a historical policy that changed relative land prices; and, ii) examining the relationship between climate mismatch and mortality. Finally, we project how climate change shapes the geography of US population growth by altering migration patterns, both historically and into the 21st century.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32035,32035,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
"The Modern Wholesaler: Global Sourcing, Domestic Distribution, and Scale Economies",Sharat Ganapati,"Nearly half of all transactions in the $5 trillion market for manufactured goods in the United States were intermediated by wholesalers in 2012, up from 32 percent in 1992. Seventy percent of this increase is due to the growth of “superstar” firms - the largest one percent of wholesalers. Estimates based on detailed administrative data show that the rise of the largest firms was driven by an intuitive linkage between their sourcing of goods from abroad and an expansion of their domestic distribution network to reach more buyers. Both elements require scale economies and lead to increased wholesaler market shares and markups. Counterfactual analysis shows that despite increases in wholesaler market power and markups, scale has benefits. Buyers gain access to globally sourced varieties, nationwide distribution networks, and increased quality while wholesalers decrease their marginal costs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32036,32036,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Bootstrap Diagnostics for Irregular Estimators,"Isaiah Andrews, Jesse M.

When such approximations are unreliable, they can lead the audience to make misguided decisions. We propose to measure the failure of the conventional normal approximation for a given estimator by the total variation distance between a bootstrap distribution and the normal distribution parameterized by the point estimate and standard error. For a wide class of decision problems and a class of uninformative priors, we show that a multiple of the total variation distance bounds the mistakes which result from relying on the conventional normal approximation. In a sample of recent empirical articles that use a bootstrap for inference, we find that the conventional normal approximation is often poor.

The Impact of Comprehensive Student Support on Crime: Evidence from the Pathways to Education Program,"Adam M.

The program, called Pathways to Education, bundles supports such as regular coaching, tutoring, group activities, free public transportation tickets and bursaries for postsecondary education. In this paper, we use a difference-in-differences approach that compares students living in public housing communities where the program was offered to those living in communities where the program was not offered over time. We find that eligibility for Pathways reduces the likelihood of being charged with a crime by 32 percent at its Regent Park location.

Destabilisation of bank deposits across destinations: assessment and policy implications,"Ulrich Bindseil, Richard Senner","Rapid and large deposit outflows from banks have regained attention in the context of the March 2023 demises of Credit Suisse, SVB and other regional US banks. Moreover, the possible introduction of CBDC or a marked success of stablecoins are perceived as additional clouds over the future of deposit funding. While the bank run literature rarely pays attention to where bank deposits can flow to, this paper distinguishes the different flow of funds mechanics across all possible destinations and reviews for each the current and prospective future factors that may contribute to the observed increase of the speed and size of bank runs. While some of these factors can be contained through policy measures, others, like the intensified competition between banks will inevitably stay, and bank balance sheet management and liquidity regulation need to accept the new normal of somewhat less stable and more expensive sight deposits.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2887~845e136b3b.en.pdf?e8515accd3d688ab48f11176a9c93da4,2887,15-Jan-24,ECB,1/16/2024
Intergenerational Mobility and Credit,"J. Carter Braxton, Nisha Chikhale, Kyle F. Herkenhoff, Gordon M. Phillips","We combine the Decennial Census, credit reports, and administrative earnings to create the first panel dataset linking parent’s credit access to the labor market outcomes of children in the U.S. We find that a 10% increase in parent’s unused revolving credit during their children’s adolescence (13 to 18 years old) is associated with 0.28% to 0.37% greater labor earnings of their children during early adulthood (25 to 30 years old). Using these empirical elasticities, we estimate a dynastic, defaultable debt model to examine how the democratization of credit since the 1970s – modeled as both greater credit limits and more lenient bankruptcy – affected intergenerational mobility. Surprisingly, we find that the democratization of credit led to less intergenerational mobility and greater inequality. Two offsetting forces underlie this result: (1) greater credit limits raise mobility by facilitating borrowing and investment among low-income households; (2) however, more lenient bankruptcy policy lowers mobility since low-income households dissave, hit their constraints more often, and reduce investments in their children. Quantitatively, the democratization of credit is dominated by more lenient bankruptcy policy and so mobility declines between the 1970s and 2000s.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32031,32031,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
"Fiscal Stimulus, Deposit Competition, and the Rise of Shadow Banking: Evidence from China","Viral V. Acharya, Qian Jun, Yang Su, Zhishu Yang","The rise of shadow banking and attendant financial fragility in China can be traced to intensified deposit competition following the global financial crisis (GFC). Deposit competition intensified after the GFC because the GFC slowed down banks’ deposit growth from cross-border money inflows and simultaneously led to fiscal stimulus supported by banks’ credit expansion. Exploiting the fact that one big state-owned bank was particular affected by the GFC through these two channels, we document—by exploring small and medium-sized banks’ branch-level overlap with this big bank—that deposit competition increased banks’ reliance on shadow banking. In particular, exposed banks issued Wealth Management Products (WMPs)—short-maturity, off-balance-sheet substitutes for deposits—creating rollover risks for the issuers, as reflected by higher yields on new WMPs, higher borrowing rates in the interbank market, and lower stock-market performance during liquidity stress.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32034,32034,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health), adults aged 25-34 and their high school best friends are focused on. An instrumental variable technique is employed to estimate peer effects in opioid misuse. Severe injuries in the previous year are used as an instrument for opioid misuse in order to estimate the causal impact of someone misusing opioids on the probability that their best friends also misuse. The estimated peer effects are significant: Having a best friend with a reported serious injury in the previous year increases the probability of own opioid misuse by around 7 percentage points in a population where 17 percent ever misuses opioids.

The Puzzling Behavior of Spreads during Covid,"Stelios S. Fourakis, Loukas Karabarbounis","Advanced economies borrowed substantially during the Covid recession to fund their fiscal policy. The Covid recession differed from the Great Recession in that sovereign debt markets remained calm and spreads barely responded. We study the experience of Greece, the most extreme manifestation of the puzzling behavior of spreads during Covid. We develop a small open economy model with long-term debt and default, which we augment with official lenders, heterogeneous households and sectors, and Covid constraints on labor supply and consumption demand. The model is quantitatively consistent with the observed boom-bust cycle of Greece before Covid and salient observations on macro aggregates, government debt, and the sovereign spread during Covid. The spread is stable despite a rise in external borrowing during Covid, because lockdowns were perceived as transitory and the bailouts of the 2010s had tilted the composition of debt at the beginning of Covid away from defaultable private debt. The ECB's policy of purchasing debt in secondary markets during Covid did not stabilize spreads so much, but allowed the government to provide transfers that reduced inequality.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32044,32044,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Is the Electricity Sector a Weak Link in Development?,"Jonathan M.

We answer this question using a dynamic multi-sector model in which electricity is a strong complement to other inputs in production. We parameterize the model using our own new measures of electricity-sector TFP across countries. The model predicts modest long-run GDP gains from improving electricity-sector TFP, contrary to the notion that electricity is a weak link. Parameterizations that make electricity a weak link mostly require the electricity sector to be counterfactually large or unproductive.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32041,32041,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024
Trade Barriers and Market Power: Evidence from Argentina's Discretionary Import Restrictions,"David Atkin, Joaquin Blaum, Pablo D. Fajgelbaum, Augusto Ospital","Countries are increasingly turning to non-tariff barriers that are hard to measure and often illegal under WTO rules. What are the impacts of these policies, and what do they reveal about market power in international trade? We study a comprehensive system of discretionary import licenses imposed by Argentina, where we observe the universe of transaction-level requests and approval decisions between 2013 and 2015. Approvals varied across firms and products in a manner consistent with the government's trade and investment objectives, and over time to safeguard the current account. Interacting these sources of variation to construct an instrument, we estimate that stricter restrictions increased the prices paid by importers, a result that runs counter to competitive price-setting behavior. Informed by a model and a classifier-Lasso, the price and quantity responses identify—for each combination of importer, narrow product, and origin—which side (importer or exporter) holds market power. We find that larger importers are more likely to hold market power, and those trading with richer countries are less likely to. The market-power distribution strongly shapes the effects of quantitative restrictions and the magnitude of optimal tariffs. Import prices rose by 4% as a result of Argentina's import restrictions, but would have risen by 13% (fallen by 8%) had all foreign firms (Argentinian firms) held market power.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32037,32037,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024

Religious Conversion across Countries,"Robert J. Barro, Rachel M.

The International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) waves for 1991, 1998, 2008, and 2018 allow for calculations of country-wide conversion rates based on religion adherence at the time of each survey and a retrospective question that gauges adherence when the respondent was raised. The analysis applies to 8 types of religion for 58 countries (125 total observations). The rate of conversion depends positively on measures of religious pluralism, negatively on official restrictions that inhibit conversion, negatively on a history of Communism, negatively on real per capita GDP, and positively on years of schooling.

In the model, firms with a high return to capital increase their investment more strongly in response to a monetary policy expansion, thus reducing misallocation. This feature creates a new time-inconsistent incentive for the central bank to engineer an unexpected monetary expansion to temporarily reduce misallocation. However, price stability is the optimal timeless response to demand, financial or TFP shocks.

Automation and Gender: Implications for Occupational Segregation and the Gender Skill Gap,"Patricia Cortés, Ying Feng, Nicolás Guida-Johnson, Jessica Pan","We examine the differential effects of automation on the labor market and educational outcomes of women relative to men over the past four decades. Although women were disproportionately employed in occupations with a high risk of automation in 1980, they were more likely to shift to high-skill, high-wage occupations than men in over time. We provide a causal link by exploiting variation in local labor market exposure to automation attributable to historical differences in local industry structure. For a given change in the exposure to automation across commuting zones, women were more likely than men to shift out of routine task-intensive occupations to high-skill, high wage occupations over the subsequent decade. The net effect is that initially routine-intensive local labor markets experienced greater occupational gender integration. College attainment among younger workers, particularly women, also rose significantly more in areas more exposed to automation. We propose a model of occupational choice with endogenous skill investments, where social skills and routine tasks are q-complements, and women have a comparative advantage in social skills, to explain the observed patterns. Supporting the model mechanisms, areas with greater exposure to automation experienced a greater movement of women into occupations with high social skill (and high cognitive) requirements than men.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32030,32030,24-Jan,NBER,1/16/2024

"Systemic Tail Risk: High-Frequency Measurement, Evidence and Implications","Deniz Erdemlioglu, Christopher J. Neely, and Xiye Yang","We develop a new framework to measure market-wide (systemic) tail risk in the cross-section of high-frequency stock returns. We estimate the time-varying jump intensities of asset prices and introduce a testing approach that identifies multi-asset tail risk based on the release times of scheduled news announcements. Using high-frequency data on individual U.S. stocks and sector-specific ETF portfolios, we find that most of the FOMC announcements create systemic left tail risk, but there is no evidence that macro announcements do so. The magnitude of the tail risk induced by Fed news varies over the business cycle, peaks during the global financial crisis and remains high over different phases of unconventional monetary policy. We use our approach to construct a Fed-induced systemic tail risk (STR) indicator. STR helps explain the pre-FOMC announcement drift and significantly increases variance risk premia, particularly for the meetings without press conferences.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-016,2023-016A,23-Jul,FED-STLOUIS,7/1/2023

Decomposing the Government Transfer Multiplier,"Timothy Conley, Bill Dupor, Rong Li, and Yijiang Zhou","We estimate the local, spillover and aggregate causal effects of government transfers on personal income. We identify exogenous changes in federal transfers to residents at the state-level using legislated social security cost-of-living adjustments between 1952 and 1974.  Each effect is measured as a multiplier: the change in personal income in response to a one unit change in transfers. The local multiplier, i.e., the effect of own-state transfers on own-state income holding fixed other state's income, at a four-quarter horizon is approximately 3.4. The cross-state spillover multiplier is about -0.7, but not statistically different from zero. The aggregate multiplier, i.e., the sum of its local and spillover components, equals 2.7.  More generally, our paper provides a template for conducting inference that decomposes an aggregate effect into its local and spillover components.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-017,2023-017C,23-Jul,FED-STLOUIS,7/1/2023
"Time Averaging Meets Labor Supplies of Heckman, Lochner, and Taber","Sebastian Graves, Victoria Gregory, Lars Ljungqvist, and Thomas J.

The HLT model forced all agents to retire at age 65, while our model allows them to choose career lengths. A benchmark social security system puts all of our workers at corner solutions of their career-length choice problems and lets our model reproduce HLT model outcomes. But alternative tax and social security arrangements dislodge some agents from those corners, bringing associated changes in equilibrium prices and human capital accumulation decisions. A reform that links social security benefits to age but not to employment status eliminates the implicit tax on working beyond 65. High taxes with revenues returned lump-sum keep agents off corner solutions, raising the aggregate labor supply elasticity and threatening to bring about a “dual labor market” in which many people decide not to supply labor.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-012,2023-012A,23-May,FED-STLOUIS,5/1/2023
Preventive vs. Curative Medicine: A Macroeconomic Analysis of Health Care over the Life Cycle,Serdar Ozkan,"This paper studies differences in health care usage and health outcomes between low- and high-income individuals. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) I find that early in life the rich spend significantly more on health care, whereas from middle to very old age medical spending of the poor surpasses that of the rich by 25%. In addition, low-income individuals are less likely to incur any medical expenditures in a given year, yet, when they do, their expenses are more likely to be extreme. To account for these facts, I develop and estimate a life-cycle model of two types of health capital: physical and preventive. Physical health capital determines survival probabilities, whereas preventive health capital governs the endogenous distribution of shocks to physical health capital, thereby controlling the life expectancy. Moreover, I incorporate important features of the U.S. health care system such as private health insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare. In the model, from the very early ages the rich spend more in preventive health to expand their life expectancy, which leads to milder health shocks (and lower curative medical expenditures) for them in old age compared to the poor. Public insurance—which is designed to insure large expenditures—amplifies these differences by hampering the incentives of the poor to invest in preventive health. I use the model to examine a counterfactual economy with universal health insurance in which 75% of preventive medical spending is reimbursed. My results suggest that policies encouraging the use of health care by the poor early in life produce significant welfare gains, even when fully accounting for the increase in taxes required to pay for them.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-025,2023-025B,23-Sep,FED-STLOUIS,9/1/2023
Uncovering the Differences among Displaced Workers: Evidence from Canadian Job Separation Records,"Serdar Birinci, Youngmin Park, Thomas Pugh, and Kurt See","We revisit the measurement of the sources and consequences of job displacement using Canadian job separation records. To circumvent administrative data limitations, conventional approaches address selection by identifying displacement effects through mass-layoff separations, which are interpreted as involuntary. We refine this procedure and find that only a quarter of mass-layoff separations are indeed layoffs. Isolating mass-layoff separations that reflect involuntary displacement, we find twice the earnings losses relative to existing estimates. We uncover heterogeneity in losses for separations with different reason and timing, ranging from 15 percent for quits after a mass layoff to 60 percent for layoffs before it.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-022,2023-022B,23-Oct,FED-STLOUIS,10/1/2023
"Insurance corporations’ balance sheets, financial stability and monetary policy","Christoph Kaufmann, Jaime Leyva, Manuela Storz","The euro area insurance sector and its relevance for real economy financing have grown significantly over the last two decades. This paper analyses the effects of monetary policy on the size and composition of insurers’ balance sheets, as well as the implications of these effects for financial stability. We find that changes in monetary policy have a significant impact on both sector size and risk-taking. Insurers’ balance sheets grow materially after a monetary loosening, implying an increase of the sector’s financial intermediation capacity and an active transmission of monetary policy through the insurance sector. We also find evidence of portfolio re-balancing consistent with the risk-taking channel of monetary policy. After a monetary loosening, insurers increase credit, liquidity and duration risk-taking in their asset portfolios. Our results suggest that extended periods of low interest rates lead to rising financial stability risks among non-bank financial intermediaries.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2892~8f94a17da7.en.pdf?013fb6a2df5a3d7217b6061f0bcc4103,2892,17-Jan-24,ECB,1/17/2024

Structural Change and the Rise in Markups,Ricardo Marto,"Is the recent rise in markups caused by increased monopoly power or is it a natural consequence of structural change? I show that the rise in aggregate markups has been driven by a reallocation of market share away from non-services to services-producing firms and a faster increase of services’ markups. I develop a two-sector model to assess the sources of the rise in markups, in which the two forces of structural change play opposing roles. On one hand, an increase in the relative productivity of manufacturing leads to a decline of the relative price of manufactured goods and to an increase of the goods markups. On the other hand, the increase in incomes that triggers the rise of the services sector leads to higher markups for firms in services. I show that the rise in markups is in line with the rise of the services sector and the fall of the relative price of manufactured goods, and may not necessarily reflect a decline of competition. I provide novel experimental evidence supporting the notion that the price elasticity of demand decreases with income.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-002,2024-002B,24-Jan,FED-STLOUIS,1/17/2024

We find strong vertical sorting on income and education, and horizontal sorting on race. We find that women put significant effort into targeting men at the top of the desirability scale, while men put less effort and target women with similar characteristics. We find no improvement in quality of matching and no noticeable changes in sorting patterns or individual search behavior, despite rapid improvement in search technology.

Quantifying the Social Value of a Universal COVID-19 Vaccine and Incentivizing Its Development,"Rachel Glennerster, Thomas Kelly, Claire McMahon, Chad Syverson","A booster of the COVID-19 vaccine targeting the prevailing Omicron variant did not become available in the United States until a year after the variant was first detected. This pattern of developing, testing, and distributing a variant-specific booster may become the default response to further waves of COVID-19 caused by new variants. An innovation with realistic scientific potential—a universal COVID-19 vaccine, effective against existing and future variants—could provide much more value by preempting new variants. Averaged across Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate the incremental value to the U.S. population of a universal COVID-19 vaccine to be $1.5–$2.6 trillion greater than variant-specific boosters (depending on how the arrival rate of variants is modeled). This social value eclipses the cost of an advance market commitment to incentivize the universal vaccine by several orders of magnitude.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/quantifying-the-social-value-of-a-universal-covid-19-vaccine-and-incentivizing-its-development/,2024-05,16-Jan-24,BFI,1/17/2024
From Population Growth to TFP Growth,Hiroshi Inokuma and Juan M. Sánchez,"A slowdown in population growth causes a decline in business dynamism by increasing the share of old businesses. But how does it affect productivity growth? We answer this question by extending a standard firm dynamics model to include endogenous productivity growth. Theoretically, the growth rate of the size of surviving old businesses is a “sufficient statistic"" for determining the direction and magnitude of the impact of population growth on TFP growth. Quantitatively, this effect is significant across balanced growth paths for the United States and Japan. TFP growth in the United States falls by 0.10-0.23 percentage points because of the slowing in population growth between 1900 and 2060. The same driving force produces a noticeably bigger response in Japan. Despite the significant long-run effect, we discover that changes in TFP growth are slow in reaction to population growth changes due to two short-run counterbalancing factors.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-006,2023-006C,23-Aug,FED-STLOUIS,8/1/2023

Despite the rich heterogeneity, the model is highly tractable as the optimal consumption, labor supply, capital accumulation, and migration and reallocation decisions of individual workers across different markets have closed-form expressions and can be aggregated.

On the Validity of Classical and Bayesian DSGE-Based Inference,Katerina Petrova,"This paper studies large sample classical and Bayesian inference in a prototypical linear DSGE model and demonstrates that inference on the structural parameters based on a Gaussian likelihood is unaffected by departures from Gaussianity of the structural shocks. This surprising result is due to a cancellation in the asymptotic variance resulting into a generalized information equality for the block corresponding to the structural parameters. The underlying reason for the cancellation is the certainty equivalence property of the linear rational expectation model.  The main implication of this result is that classical and Bayesian Gaussian inference achieve a semi-parametric efficiency bound and there is no need for a “sandwich-form” correction of the asymptotic variance of the structural parameters. Consequently, MLE-based confidence intervals and Bayesian credible sets of the deep parameters based on a Gaussian likelihood have correct asymptotic coverage even when the structural shocks are non-Gaussian. On the other hand, inference on the reduced-form parameters characterizing the volatility of the shocks is invalid whenever the structural shocks have a non-Gaussian density and the paper proposes a simple Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm that achieves correct large sample inference for the volatility parameters.",https://www.newyorkfed.org//research/staff_reports/sr1084,1084,1/16/2024,FED-NEWYORK,1/17/2024
Pandemic labor force participation and net worth fluctuations,Miguel Faria e Castro and Samuel Jordan-Wood,"The U.S. labor force participation rate (LFPR) experienced a record drop during the early pandemic. While it has since recovered to 62.2% as of December 2022, it was still 1.41 pp below its pre-pandemic peak. This gap is explained mostly by a permanent decline in the LFPR for workers older than 55. This paper argues that wealth effects driven by the historically high returns in major asset classes such as stocks and housing may have influenced these trends. Combining an estimated model of wealth effects on labor supply with micro data on balance sheet composition, we show that changes in net worth caused by realized returns explain half of the drop in LFPR in the 2020-21 period and over 80% of ""excess retirements'' during the same period.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-010,2023-010A,23-May,FED-STLOUIS,5/1/2023
Immigration from a terror-prone nation: destination nation’s optimal immigration and counterterrorism policies,"Subhayu Bandyopadhyay, Khusrav Gaibulloev, and Todd Sandler","The paper presents a two-country model in which a destination country chooses its immigration quota and proactive counterterrorism actions in response to immigration from a terror-plagued source country.  After the destination country fixes its two policies, immigrants decide between supplying labor or conducting terrorist attacks, which helps determine equilibrium labor supply and wages.  The analysis accounts for the marginal disutility of lost rights/freedoms stemming from stricter counterterror measures as well the inherent radicalization of migrants.  Comparative statics involve changes to those two parameters.  For example, an enhanced importance attached to lost rights is shown to limit immigration quotas and counterterrorism actions.  In contrast, increased source-country radicalization reduces immigration quotas but has an ambiguous effect on optimal proactive measures.

Two methods used to estimate the impulse responses in these models are generalized impulse response functions and local projections. Local projections depend on the observed switches in the data, while generalized impulse response functions rely on correctly specifying regime process. Using Monte Carlos with different misspecifications, we determine under what conditions either method is preferred. We then extend model-average impulse responses to this nonlinear environment and show that they generally perform better than either generalized impulse response functions and local projections.

Granular shocks to corporate leverage and the macroeconomic transmission of monetary policy,"Fédéric Holm-Hadulla, Claire Thürwächter","We study how shocks to corporate leverage alter the macroeconomic transmission of monetary policy. We identify leverage shocks as idiosyncratic firm-level disturbances that are aggregated up to a size-weighted country-level average to generate a Granular Instrumental Variable (Gabaix and Koijen, forthcoming). Interacting this instrumental variable with high-frequency identified monetary policy shocks, we find that transmission to the price level strengthens in the presence of leverage shocks, while the real effects of monetary policy are unaffected. We show that this disconnect can be rationalized with an internal devaluationchannel. Economies experiencing an increase in leverage exhibit a stronger monetary policy-induced contraction in domestic demand. This, however, is counteracted by a weaker contraction in exports, facilitated by their improved price competitiveness.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2891~7eb017c33f.en.pdf?73042c95f428bfa1b33ef4b25af8f9b7,2891,17-Jan-24,ECB,1/17/2024

The basic model builds on that developed in Chen et. al. (2014) which, in turn, draws inspiration from the pioneering work of Tobin (1969) and Gurley and Shaw (1960). The paper focuses, in particular, on the implications of introducing new types of fixed-rate financial assets in the financial system including retail and wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), stablecoins issued by narrow nonbanks, and deposits issued by narrow banks. The analysis also provides a crude way of capturing some of the effects of bank capital and liquidity regulation on financial intermediation and monetary policy implementation. Perhaps the most important conclusion is that the introduction of new fixed-rate assets by the Federal Reserve or by other financial intermediaries can have significant effects on equilibrium interest rates and patterns of financial intermediation and may also affect the potency of monetary policy tools. These effects are most pronounced when new financial assets are close substitutes for existing financial assets.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/a-field-guide-to-monetary-policy-implementation-issues-in-a-new-world-with-cbdc-stablecoin-and-narrow-banks.htm,2024-001,24-Jan,FED-BOARD,1/17/2024

How Much Should We Trust Regional-Exposure Designs?,Jeremy Majerovitz and Karthik Sastry,"Many prominent studies in macroeconomics, labor, and trade use panel data on regions to identify the local effects of aggregate shocks. These studies construct regional-exposure instruments as an observed aggregate shock times an observed regional exposure to that shock. We argue that the most economically plausible source of identification in these settings is uncorrelatedness of observed and unobserved aggregate shocks. Even when the regression estimator is consistent, we show that inference is complicated by cross-regional residual correlations induced by unobserved aggregate shocks. We suggest two-way clustering, two-way heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent standard errors, and randomization inference as options to solve this inference problem. We also develop a feasible optimal instrument to improve efficiency. In an application to the estimation of regional fiscal multipliers, we show that the standard practice of clustering by region generates confidence intervals that are too small. When we construct confidence intervals with robust methods, we can no longer reject multipliers close to zero at the 95% level. The feasible optimal instrument more than doubles statistical power; however, we still cannot reject low multipliers.

This exercise suggests that extending the current U.S. unemployment insurance scheme to the self-employed comes with a clear increase in the transition rate from self-employment to unemployment and an unequal benefits-to-contributions ratio across skill groups.

Trade Liberalization versus Protectionism: Dynamic Welfare Asymmetries,"B. Ravikumar, Ana Maria Santacreu, and Michael J.

We incorporate dynamics through capital accumulation into a standard Armington trade model and show that the welfare changes are asymmetric: Losses from protectionism are smaller than the gains from liberalization. In contrast, standard static trade models imply that the losses equal the gains. The intuition for asymmetry in our model is that, following protectionism, the economy can coast off of previously accumulated capital stock, so higher trade costs do not imply large losses immediately. We develop an accounting device to decompose the source of welfare asymmetries into three time-varying contributions: share of income allocated to consumption, measured productivity, and capital stock.

Because of the duration mismatch on the government balance sheet, the government's fiscal space expands when real rates decline, allowing the government to keep its promises to older Japanese households.

Risk Management in Monetary Policymaking: The 1994-95 Fed Tightening Episode,Kevin L. Kliesen,"The 1994-95 Fed tightening episode was one of the most notable in the Fed’s history. First, the FOMC raised the policy rate by 300 basis points in a year, even though headline and core inflation were trending lower prior to the liftoff that occurred in February 1994. Second, the Fed’s actions caught the Treasury market by surprise, triggering a sharp decline in long-term bond prices. Third, Fed Chair Alan Greenspan and the Federal Open Market Committee were regularly surprised that inflation was not rising by more than the forecasts suggested during the episode. This article presents some evidence that the Greenbook forecast systemically, albeit modestly, overpredicted CPI inflation during the tightening period. Greenspan eventually concluded that the nascent strengthening in labor productivity growth that was a key factor in restraining the growth of unit labor costs, and thus in keeping inflation pressures in check. At the same time, the success of the episode stemmed importantly from the decision by Greenspan and the FOMC to increase the policy rate to a level deemed restrictive for most of 1995. This effort reduced longer-run inflation expectations without triggering a recession. By that metric the 1994-95 tightening episode was a roaring success. Although not the focus of this article, the 1994-95 tightening episode holds important lessons for the FOMC in late 2023, which is attempting to defuse a sharp and unexpected increase in headline and core inflation to levels not seen since the early 1980s without triggering a recession.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-030,2023-030A,23-Dec,FED-STLOUIS,12/1/2023

The Shifting and Steepening of Phillips Curves During the Pandemic Recovery: International Evidence and Some Theory,"Tryggvi Gudmundsson, Chris Jackson, Rafael A Portillo","We study the global inflation surge during the pandemic recovery and the implications for aggregate and sectoral Phillips curves. We provide evidence that Phillips curves shifted up and steepened across advanced economies, and that differences in the inflation response across sectors imply the relative price of goods has been pro-cyclical this time around rather than a-cyclical as during previous cycles. We show analytically that these three features emerge endogenously in a two-sector new-Keynesian model when we introduce unbalanced recoveries that run against a supply constraint in the goods sector. A calibrated exercise shows that the resulting changes to the output-inflation relation are quantitatively important and improve the model's ability to replicate the inflation surge during this period.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/12/The-Shifting-and-Steepening-of-Phillips-Curves-During-the-Pandemic-Recovery-International-543712,WPIEA2024007,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/17/2024
Optimal Dynamic Tax-Transfer Policies in Heterogeneous-Agents Economies,YiLi Chien and Yi Wen,"In the design of an optimal tax-transfer system, there are two complementary conventional wisdoms: the labor-efficiency argument and the debt-efficiency argument. The former emphasizes the trade-off between redistribution and distortions in the labor market, while the latter emphasizes the trade-off between gains from monopoly rents and distortions in the asset market. We use an analytically tractable infinite-horizon model with both ex-ante and ex-post heterogeneity to show that neither argument is complete in the design of the tax-transfer system. Instead, in Aiyagari-type models the optimal system should be determined at the point where the intertemporal wedge between the market interest rate and the time discount rate is completely eliminated, provided that the government fiscal space permits an interior Ramsey steady state. Otherwise the optimal labor tax rate approaches 100% regardless of the Pareto weight distribution in the social welfare function.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-009,2023-009A,23-May,FED-STLOUIS,5/1/2023

In order to answer this question, we construct a parsimonious nonlinear time series model that allows for inflation regimes. We find that the effects of monetary policy are markedly different when year-over-year inflation exceeds 5.5 percent. Below this threshold, changes in monetary policy have a short-lived effect on prices, but no effect on the unemployment rate, giving a potential explanation for the recent “soft landing” in the United States.

On the Transition to Modern Growth,B. Ravikumar and Guillaume Vandenbroucke,"We study a simple model where a single good can be produced using a diminishing-returns technology (Malthus) and a constant-returns technology (Solow). The economy's output exhibits three stages: (i) stagnation, (ii) transition with increasing growth, and (iii) constant growth in the long run. We map the Malthus technology to agriculture and show that the share of agricultural employment is sufficient to determine the onset of economic transition. Using data on the share, we estimate the onset of transition for the U.S. and Western Europe without using output data. Our model implies that output growth during the transition is a first-order autoregressive process and that the rate of decline in the share of agricultural employment is a sufficient statistic to describe the output growth. Quantitatively, while there is no a priori reason why agricultural employment would pin down output dynamics over two centuries, the autoregressive coefficient on the output growth process is practically the same as the one implied by the rate of decline in the share of agricultural employment.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-026,2023-026B,23-Oct,FED-STLOUIS,10/1/2023
Where Did the Workers Go? The Effect of COVID Immigration Restrictions on Post-Pandemic Labor Market Tightness,"Maggie Isaacson, Cassie Marks, Lowell R. Ricketts, and Hannah Rubinton","During the COVID pandemic there were unprecedented shortfalls in immigration. At the same time, during the economic recovery, the labor market was tight, with the number of vacancies per unemployed worker reaching 2.5, more than twice its pre-pandemic average. In this paper, we investigate whether these two trends are linked. We do not find evidence to support the hypothesis that the immigration shortfalls caused the tight labor market for two reasons. First, at the peak, we were missing about 2 million immigrant workers, but this number had largely recovered by February 2022 just as the labor market was becoming tight. Second,  states, cities, and industries that were most impacted by the immigration restrictions did not have larger increases in labor market tightness. We build a shift-share instrument to examine the causal impact of the immigration restrictions and still find no evidence to support the hypothesis that the immigration restrictions were the underlying cause of increased labor market tightness.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2024-003,2024-003B,Jan-24,FED-STLOUIS,1/18/2024
The Anatomy of Concentration: New Evidence From a Unified Framework,"Kenneth R. Ahern, Lei Kong, Xinyan Yan","Concentration is a single summary statistic driven by two opposing forces: the number of firms in a market and the evenness of their market shares.  This paper introduces a generalized measure of concentration that allows researchers to vary the relative importance of each force.  Using the generalized measure, we show that the widely-cited evidence of increasing industrial employment concentration is driven by the Herfindahl Index's over-weighting of evenness and under-weighting of firm counts.  We propose an alternative, equally-weighted measure that has an equivalent economic meaning as the Herfindahl Index, but possesses superior statistical attributes in typical firm size distributions. Using this balanced measure, we find that employment concentration decreased from 1990 to 2020.  Finally, decomposing aggregate diversity into meaningful geographic and industry subdivisions reveals that concentration within regional markets has fallen, while concentration between markets has risen.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32057,32057,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024

Quantitative easing and the functioning of the gilt repo market,"Mahmoud Fatouh, Simone Giansante and Steven Ongena","We assess the impact of quantitative easing (QE) on the provisioning of liquidity and the pricing in the UK gilt repo market. We compare the behaviour of banks that received reserves injections via QE operations to other similar banks in terms of the amounts lent and pricing. We also investigate whether leverage ratio capital requirements affected the amounts of liquidity supplied by broker-dealers and the spreads they charged. We find that QE interventions can improve liquidity provision, and that their size determines how this is attained. QE can also reduce the cost of borrowing in the repo market unless it was associated with spikes in demand for liquidity. Our findings further indicate that the leverage ratio supports the provision of liquidity during stress, as it prompts banks to become less leveraged. However, the larger capital charge repo transactions attract under the leverage ratio requirement is reflected in their spreads.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/quantitative-easing-and-the-functioning-of-the-gilt-repo-market,1055,"Fri, 19 Jan 2",BOE,1/22/2024

We estimate the distribution of contestants’ prestige values using a structural model of bidding by a contestant with rational expectations about sabotage effectiveness taken from the data.

Sorting under Risk Sharing and Complementarities,"Hector Chade, Ilse Lindenlaub","How does the presence of risk sharing affect sorting patterns on productive attributes when there are  complementarities among partners' skills in match output? We develop a matching model in which risk-averse agents, who differ in skills, match pairwise for productive purposes. Match output has stochastic returns and matched partners efficiently share this risk.  We find that under plausible assumptions the risk-sharing benefit of marriage tends to push toward negative sorting on partners' skills. To obtain the prediction of positive skill sorting—a robust empirical feature of marriage markets—this force needs to be counteracted by sufficiently strong skill complementarities in match output. We provide a novel inequality that characterizes monotone (positive or negative) equilibrium  sorting, balancing out skill complementarities and risk-sharing considerations in the right way. Several classes of primitives (utility and match output functions) render monotone sorting optimal. We then highlight a new implication of positive sorting on exogenous skills for matching patterns on endogenous differences in risk aversion: Positive sorting on skills translates into positive sorting on risk aversion—in line with the evidence from marriage markets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32051,32051,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024

In doing so, we focus on the various ways in which income may have contributed to these changes using a statistical decomposition. We decompose the overall change in the Black-White PM2.5 exposure gap into (1) components that stem from rank-preserving compression in the overall pollution distribution and (2) changes that stem from a reordering of Black and White households within the pollution distribution. We find a significant narrowing of the Black-White PM2.5 exposure gap over this time period that is overwhelmingly driven by rank-preserving changes rather than positional changes. However, the relative positions of Black and White households at the upper end of the pollution distribution have meaningfully shifted in the most recent years.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32060,32060,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024

Quantifying the Social Value of a Universal COVID-19 Vaccine and Incentivizing Its Development,"Rachel Glennerster, Thomas Kelly, Claire T. McMahon, Christopher M.

This pattern of developing, testing, and distributing a variant-specific booster may become the default response to further waves of COVID-19 caused by new variants. An innovation with realistic scientific potential—a universal COVID-19 vaccine, effective against existing and future variants—could provide much more value by preempting new variants. Averaged across Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate the incremental value to the U.S. population of a universal COVID-19 vaccine to be $1.5–$2.6 trillion greater than variant-specific boosters (depending on how the arrival rate of variants is modeled). This social value eclipses the cost of an advance market commitment to incentivize the universal vaccine by several orders of magnitude.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32059,32059,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024
Government-Sponsored Mortgage Securitization and Financial Crises,Wayne Passmore and Roger Sparks,"This paper analyzes a model of the mortgage market, considering scenarios with and without government-sponsored mortgage securitization. Conventional wisdom says that securitization, by fostering diversification and creating a “safe” asset in the form of mortgage-backed security (MBS), will reduce risk and enhance liquidity, thereby mitigating financial crises. We construct a strategic-game framework to model the interaction between the securitizer and banks. In this framework, the securitizer initiates the process by setting the MBS contract terms, which includes the guaranteed rate and the criterion that qualifies a mortgage for securitization. The bank then selects which qualifying mortgages to exchange for the MBS. Our investigation leads to a key result: government-sponsored securitization, somewhat counterintuitively, is more likely to exacerbate the severity and frequency of financial crises.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/government-sponsored-mortgage-securitization-and-financial-crises.htm,2024-002,Jan-24,FED-BOARD,1/22/2024
Thick Market Externalities and the Persistence of the Opioid Epidemic,"David M. Cutler, J. Travis Donahoe","Opioid overdose death rates in the United States have risen continuously for over three decades, increasing 2,142 percent in total from 1990 to 2020. This is surprising. One might expect drug epidemics to be self-limiting, as policy and individual behavior reacts to observed deaths. We study why opioid deaths have risen so greatly and for so long. We consider three reasons for a prolonged epidemic: exogenous and continuing changes in demand or supply, and spillovers in demand for opioids across users, which we term “thick market externalities.” We show there is no evidence of sufficiently large exogenous changes in the demand or supply of opioids that could explain such a prolonged increase in death rates. We test for spillovers using county-level data on opioid deaths from 1991–2018 and opioid shipments from 2006–2009, combined with data on friendships and distance between counties. Estimating a model with addiction and spatial spillovers, we find large spillovers in opioid use and deaths across areas. A shock that increases opioid death rates by 1 in an index county causes 0.38 to 0.76 more deaths in other counties because of spillovers. Because opioids are addictive, this leads to even more deaths and spillovers in future years. In some specifications, these effects are large enough to generate a continuously increasing epidemic without any ongoing changes in demand or supply. We estimate spillovers explain 84 to 92 percent of opioid deaths from 1990 to 2018 and are the main reason deaths have increased for so long.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32055,32055,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024

To demonstrate our method, we use multi-spectral imagery—publicly available across the globe—to evaluate India’s varied road construction projects in the early 2000s. Estimating the model requires only remotely-sensed data, while evaluating welfare impacts requires one year of population data, which are increasingly available through public sources.

The analysis further reveals that most welfare gains accrued within Indian districts, demonstrating the potential benefits of using of high spatial resolution of satellite images.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32047,32047,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024
Stacked Difference-in-Differences,"Coady Wing, Seth M.

The set of identified group-time ATTs that contribute to the aggregate is trimmed to achieve compositional balance across an event window, ensuring that comparisons of the aggregate parameter over event time reveal dynamic treatment effects and differential pre-trends rather than compositional changes. Taking the trimmed aggregate ATT as a target parameter, we investigate the performance of stacked DID estimators. We show that the most basic stacked estimator does not identify the target aggregate or any other average causal effect because it applies different implicit weights to treatment and control trends. The bias can be eliminated using corrective sample weights. We present a weighted stacked DID estimator, and show that it correctly identifies the target aggregate, providing justification for using the estimator in applied work.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32054,32054,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024
"Ends versus Means: Kantians, Utilitarians, and Moral Decisions","Roland Bénabou, Armin Falk, Luca Henkel","Choosing what is morally right can be based on the consequences (ends) resulting from the decision – the Consequentialist view – or on the conformity of the means involved with some overarching notion of duty – the Deontological view. Using a series of experiments, we investigate the overall prevalence and the consistency of consequentialist and deontological decision-making, when these two moral principles come into conflict. Our design includes a real-stakes version of the classical trolley dilemma, four novel games that induce ends-versus-means tradeoffs, and a rule-following task. These six main games are supplemented with six classical self-versus-other choice tasks, allowing us to relate consequential/deontological behavior to standard measures of prosociality. Across the six main games, we find a sizeable prevalence (20 to 44%) of nonconsequentialist choices by subjects, but no evidence of stable individual preference types across situations. In particular, trolley behavior predicts no other ends-versus-means choices. Instead, which moral principle prevails appears to be context-dependent. In contrast, we find a substantial level of consistency across self-versus-other decisions, but individuals’ degree of prosociality is unrelated to how they choose in ends-versus-means tradeoffs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32073,32073,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024

"Capital, Ideas, and the Costs of Financial Frictions","Pablo Ottonello, Thomas Winberry","We study the role of financial frictions in determining the allocation of investment and innovation.  Empirically, we find that firms are investment-intensive when they have low net worth but become innovation-intensive as they accumulate more net worth.  To interpret these findings, we develop an endogenous growth model with heterogeneous firms and financial frictions.  In our model, low net worth firms are investment-intensive because their returns to capital are high.  Financial frictions slow the rate at which firms exhaust the returns to capital and shift towards innovation.  Calibrating to the US economy, we find that the resulting lower growth implies large GDP losses even though capital misallocation is small.  In other words, financial markets effectively fund the implementation of existing ideas, but do not adequately fund the discovery of new ideas.  If innovation has positive spillovers, a planner would not only raise innovation but also lower investment expenditures among constrained firms.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32056,32056,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024

What Do Shareholders Want? Consumer Welfare and the Objective of the Firm,Keith Marzilli Ericson,"Shareholders want a firm's objective function to place some weight on consumer welfare, motivated by both self-interested and altruistic motivations. Firms have a unique technology for improving consumer welfare: lowering inefficient price markups, which increases consumer welfare more than it lowers profits. Optimal pricing formulas can be adapted to account for shareholders' marginal rate of substitution between profits and consumer welfare. Calibrations from preference parameters show many shareholders should place non-trivial weights on consumer welfare.  A survey experiment on a representative sample elicits how shareholders would vote on resolutions giving strategic guidance to firms on what objective to pursue. Only 7% would vote for pure profit maximization. The median individual is indifferent between $0.44 in profits or $1 in consumer surplus, with those owning stocks preferring a lower weight on consumer welfare than non-stockholders.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32064,32064,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024

We explore these tradeoffs by observing patent examiner behavior and examination quality outcomes surrounding a 2011 reform at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that built on its bi-weekly quota system by adding a set of bonuses tied to daily examination-pendency measures.

Inflation Perceptions During the Covid Pandemic and Recovery,David Lebow and Ekaterina Peneva,"Since 2016, the Michigan Surveys of Consumers (MSC) have included questions on inflation perceptions—what people believe inflation to have been—that are worded symmetrically with their long-standing questions on inflation expectations. The questions on inflation perceptions are currently posed four times a year—in February, May, August, and November. Using available data at the time, Axelrod, Lebow, and Peneva (2018) concluded that inflation expectations and perceptions are very similar and that if perceptions were to change, expectations were likely to change as well.",https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3439,1.01702E+18,19-Jan-24,FED-BOARD-NOTES,1/22/2024
Trade Liberalization versus Protectionism: Dynamic Welfare Asymmetries,"B. Ravikumar, Ana Maria Santacreu, and Michael J. Sposi","We investigate whether the losses from an increase in trade costs (protectionism) are equal to the gains from a symmetric decrease in trade costs (liberalization). We incorporate dynamics through capital accumulation into a multicountry trade model and show that the welfare changes are asymmetric: Losses from protectionism are smaller than the gains from liberalization. In contrast, standard static trade models imply that the losses equal the gains. The intuition for asymmetry in our model is that, following protectionism, the economy can coast on its previously accumulated capital stock, so higher trade costs do not imply large losses immediately. We develop an accounting device to decompose the source of welfare asymmetries into three time-varying contributions: share of income allocated to consumption, measured productivity, and capital stock. Asymmetry in capital accumulation is the largest contributing factor, and measured productivity is the smallest.",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-019,2023-019C,Jan-24,FED-STLOUIS,1/22/2024
The Wandering Scholars: Understanding the Heterogeneity of University Commercialization,"Josh Lerner, Henry J. Manley, Carolyn Stein, Heidi L. Williams","University-based scientific research has long been argued to be a central source of commercial innovation and economic growth.  Yet at the same time, there have been long-held concerns that many university-based discoveries never realize their potential social benefits.  Looking across universities, research and commercialization activities such as start-up formation vary tremendously – variation that could reflect the composition and orientation of faculty research, university-level factors such as patenting and licensing efforts, or broader place-based factors such as location in a technology cluster.  We take a first step towards unpacking this heterogeneity in university commercialization by analyzing how the propensity of academic research to spill over to commercial innovation changes when academics move across universities. Our estimates suggest that at least 15–25% of geographic variation in commercial spillovers from university-based research is attributable to place-specific factors.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32069,32069,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024
Do Earmarks Target Low-Income and Minority Communities? Evidence from US Drinking Water,"David A. Keiser, Bhashkar Mazumder, David Molitor, Joseph S. Shapiro, Brant J. Walker","The quality and inequality of US drinking water investments have gained attention after recent environmental disasters in Flint, Michigan, and elsewhere. We compare the formula-based targeting of subsidized loans provided under the Safe Drinking Water Act with the targeting of congressional drinking water earmarks (“pork barrel” spending).  Earmarks are often critiqued for potentially privileging wealthier and more politically connected communities. We find that earmarks target Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities, partly due to targeting water systems serving large populations. Earmark and loan targeting differ significantly across all the demographics we analyze. Compared to Safe Drinking Water Act loans, earmarks disproportionately target Hispanic communities but not Black or low-income communities.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32058,32058,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024

The Economics of Information in a World of Disinformation: A Survey Part 1: Indirect Communication,"Joseph E. Stiglitz, Andrew Kosenko","We survey aspects of the intellectual development of the economics of information from the 1970s to today. We focus here on models where information is communicated indirectly through actions. Basic results, such as the failure of the fundamental theorems of welfare economics, the non-existence of competitive equilibrium, and the dependence of the nature of the equilibrium, when it exists, on both what information is available, and how information can be acquired, have been shown to be robust. Markets create asymmetries of information, even when initially none existed. While the earliest literature paid scarce attention to misinformation, subsequently it has been shown that governments can improve welfare, if disinformation is present, through fraud laws and disclosure requirements. Moreover, robust mechanism design enables agents and governments to better achieve their objectives, taking into account information asymmetries. On the other hand, market reforms that ignored their informational consequences may have lowered welfare.  Surveying both theory and applications, we review the main insights of these literatures, and highlight key messages using nontechnical language.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32049,32049,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024
Import Constraints,"Diego A. Comin, Robert C. Johnson, Callum J. Jones","During the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, international shipping and logistics capacity was strained, limiting the quantity of imports.  We investigate the impact of an import constraint on inflation, following an increase in domestic demand.  Whether the binding import constraint raises inflation depends on how it affects trade intermediation costs.  If the binding constraint raises trade costs, then import price inflation also increases.  In this case, however, foreign producer price inflation falls, and import quantities rise more for inputs than final goods.  Both these model results appear counterfactual, which suggests that import constraints may not explain observed import price inflation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32072,32072,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024

Regularization from Economic Constraints: A New Estimator for Marginal Emissions,"Stephen P. Holland, Erin T. Mansur, Valentin Verdier, Andrew J. Yates","Environmental policy is increasingly concerned with measuring emissions resulting from local changes to electricity consumption. These marginal emissions are challenging to measure because electricity grids encompass multiple locations and the information available to identify the effect of each location’s consumption on grid-wide emissions is limited. We formalize this as a high-dimensional aggregation problem: The effect of electricity consumption on emissions can be estimated precisely for each electricity generating unit (generator), but not precisely enough to obtain reliable estimates of marginal emissions by summing these effects across all generators in a grid. We study how two economic constraints can address this problem: electricity supply equals demand and an assumption of monotonicity. We show that these constraints can be used to formulate a ‘naturally regularized’ estimator, which implements an implicit penalization that does not need to be directly tuned. Under an additional assumption of sparsity, we show that our new estimator solves the high-dimensional aggregation problem, i.e., it is consistent for marginal emissions where the usual regression estimator would not be. We also develop an asymptotically valid method for inference to accompany our estimator. When applied to the U.S. electricity grid with 13 separate consumption regions, our method yields plausible patterns of marginal generation across fuel types and geographic location. Our estimates of region-level marginal emissions are precise, account for imports/exports between regions, and allow for all fuel types to potentially be on the margin.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32065,32065,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024

The Leisure Gains from International Trade,Agustin Velasquez,"The average number of hours worked has been declining in many countries. This can be explained if workers have preferences with income effects outweighing substitution effects. Then, an optimal response to rising income is to reduce labor supply to enjoy more leisure. In this paper, I develop a novel structural link between trade and aggregate labor supply. Using a multi-country Ricardian trade model, I show that reducing trade barriers leads to fewer hours worked while being compatible with an increase in welfare. In addition, I derive an hours-to-trade elasticity and estimate it by exploiting exogenous income variation generated by aggregate trade. On average, I quantify that the rise in trade openness between 1950 and 2014 explains 7 percent of the total decline in hours per worker in high-income countries.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/19/The-Leisure-Gains-from-International-Trade-543871,WPIEA2024016,"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/22/2024

This third and final migration wave of young Vietnamese immigrants was sparked by unexpected events that culminated in the Amerasian Homecoming Act. Characteristics of the wave also minimized selection effects regarding who migrated. Small differences in the age at arrival, specifically being 14-17 years old on entry compared to 18-21, resulted in substantial differences in future economic outcomes.

Do Patients Value High-Quality Medical Care? Experimental Evidence from Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment,"Carolina Lopez, Anja Sautmann, Simone G. Schaner","Can information about the value of diagnostic tests improve provider practice and help patients recognize higher quality of care? In a randomized experiment at public clinics in Mali,  health providers and patients received tailored information about the importance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria. The provider training increased provider reliance on RDTs, improving the match between a patient's malaria status and treatment with antimalarials by 15-30 percent. Nonetheless, patients were significantly less satisfied with the care they received, driven by those whose prior beliefs did not match their true malaria status. The patient information intervention did not affect treatment outcomes or patient satisfaction and reduced malaria testing. These findings are consistent with highly persistent patient beliefs that translate into low demand for diagnostic testing and limit patients' ability to recognize improved quality of care.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32075,32075,Jan-24,NBER,1/22/2024

"U.S. Monetary Policy Spillovers to Middle East and Central Asia: Shocks, Fundamentals, and Propagations","Giovanni Ugazio, Weining Xin","We empirically examine U.S. monetary policy spillovers to the Middle East and Central Asia (ME & CA) region by decomposing U.S. interest rates changes into two orthogonal shocks: the pure monetary policy shock and the information news shock. Using a sample of 16 ME & CA countries, we find that when interest rates increase, the two shocks have opposite spillovers on the region. Tightening driven by contractionary monetary policy shocks hinders growth, while tightening driven by positive information news shocks boosts growth despite higher interest rates. Countries with weaker fundamentals face more negative spillovers from contractionary monetary policy shocks but may sometimes benefit more from positive information news shocks. Moreover, high oil prices mitigate both spillovers for oil exporters while global risk appetite amplifies both spillovers. Finally, we estimate a large degree of heterogeneity in the impact of the 2022 U.S. tightening cycle on ME & CA countries, with oil exporters with stronger fundamentals withstanding well the shock and oil importers with weaker fundamentals being hit the most.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/19/U-S-542422,WPIEA2024014,"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/22/2024

Inflation heterogeneity across Austrian households. Evidence from household scanner data,"Teresa Messner, Fabio Rumler","It has been widely documented that households experience different inflation rates which are generally concealed in aggregate price indices. Using scanner data from a large household panel for Austria, we analyse price dynamics faced by individual households and try to explain the causes for the observed inflation differences. Considering not only consumption shares but also the specific product prices paid by households, we find a considerable and persistent degree of heterogeneity among household inflation rates. These are also quite variable over time, resulting from varying consumption baskets and active product substitution, allowing households to reduce their inflation exposure substantially. Factors like age and shopping behavior of households explain some of the inflation differences, whereas income does not seem to have a notable influence in normal times. However, during high inflation periods, the lowest income group is found to face higher inflation rates than other income groups.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2894~5fd5d33b3f.en.pdf?4214c17872b1be632a7ea1a6ef6552fc,2894,26-Jan-24,ECB,1/27/2024
Does FinTech Increase Bank Risk Taking?,"Selim A Elekdag, Drilona Emrullahu, Sami Ben Naceur","Motivated by its rapid growth, this paper investigates how FinTech activities influence risk taking by financial intermediaries (FIs). In this context, this paper revisits an ongoing debate on the impact of competition on financial stability: on one side, it is argued that greater competition encourages greater risk taking (competition-fragility hypothesis), while the other side of the debate asserts that more competition can increase financial stability (competition-stability hypothesis). Using a curated databased covering over 10,000 FIs and global FinTech activities, we find a robust relationship whereby greater FinTech presence is associated with heightened risk taking by FIs, offering support for the competition-fragility hypothesis. However, the inclusion of bank-, industry-, and country-specific characteristics can alter this relationship. Importantly, there is suggestive evidence indicating that in certain cases, greater FinTech presence may be associated with less FI risk taking amid stronger domestic institutions. Notwithstanding the relevance for policy, this paper presents a novel framework that may help reconcile some of the conflicting results in the literature which have found supportive evidence for each of the two competing hypotheses.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/26/Does-FinTech-Increase-Bank-Risk-Taking-544028,WPIEA2024017,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/27/2024
A Commitment Rule for Insolvency Forum,"Anthony J. Casey, Aurelio Gurrea-Martínez, Robert K. Rasmussen","In this article, we propose a new rule for determining the proper forum for insolvency proceedings. Currently, the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency—promulgated by United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”)—looks to a debtor’s center of main interest (“COMI”) to determine the proper forum for a foreign main insolvency proceeding. This rule is flawed. It is both inflexible and manipulable. It is also indeterminate and neither requires nor allows advance commitment by debtors. As a result, it leads to uncertainty, increases litigation costs, and opens the door to opportunistic manipulation by debtors. These costs, in turn, raise the cost of credit for all companies.And so, we propose a better approach—the “Commitment Rule”—for the determining proper insolvency forum. In short, the Commitment rule allows debtors to signal an advance commitment to a particular insolvency forum. To make this commitment public and binding, the debtor must put it in their company’s constitution. This upfront and observable commitment eliminates uncertainty and opportunistic manipulation.The Commitment Rule presents a rare “win-win” legal reform requiring no major tradeoff. It would reduce strategic forum shopping and minimize litigation costs while also promoting the development and selection of efficient insolvency forums, which benefit all stakeholders – debtors, creditors and society at large. These improvements support the development of financial markets, entrepreneurial innovation, and economic growth more generally. UNCITRAL should adopt the Commitment Rule as part of the Model Law.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/a-commitment-rule-for-insolvency-forum/,2024-06,25-Jan-24,BFI,1/27/2024
In Search of the Origin of Original Sin Dissipation,"Bada Han, Jangyoun Lee, Taehee Oh","In this paper, we examine how, contrary to the ‘original sin’ hypothesis, emerging market economies have gained the ability to borrow abroad in their local currency. We empirically analyze the relationship of various economic variables with local currency debt and identify three crucial conditions for the capacity to borrow in local currency: institutional quality, sufficient depth in the domestic bond market, and adequate performance in inflation targeting. While shares in JPMorgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) index also appear to be influential, the associations with local currency debt is less clear. We conduct a similar empirical analysis on portfolio equity, which represents a safer form of external liability than foreign currency debt, and verify that the depth of the equity market plays a key role in attracting foreign capital to domestic equity markets. Finally, we propose a simple portfolio model based on the inelastic market hypothesis to explain the positive correlation between capital market depth and the dissipation of original sin, which refers to the presence of more external liability in the form of equity or local currency debt. In essence, our analysis suggests that emerging market economies with reasonably strong fundamentals are not necessarily reliant on foreign currency debt.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/01/26/In-Search-of-the-Origin-of-Original-Sin-Dissipation-544049,WPIEA2024018,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 ",IMF,1/27/2024

Digital Information Provision and Behavior Change: Lessons from Six Experiments in East Africa,"Raissa Fabregas, Michael Kremer, Matthew Lowes, Robert On, Giulia Zane","Mobile phone-based informational programs are widely used worldwide, though there is little consensus on how effective they are at changing behavior. We present causal evidence on the effects of six agricultural information programs delivered through text messages in Kenya and Rwanda. The programs shared similar objectives but were implemented by three different organizations and varied in content, design, and target population. With administrative outcome data for tens of thousands of farmers across all experiments, we are sufficiently powered to detect small effects in real input purchase choices. Combining the results of all experiments through a meta-analysis, we find that the odds ratio for following the recommendations is 1.22 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.29). We cannot reject that impacts are similar across experiments and for two different agricultural inputs. There is little evidence of message fatigue, but the effects diminish over time. Providing more granular information, supplementing the texts with in-person calls, or varying the messages’ framing did not significantly increase impacts, but message repetition had modest positive effects.

"The Economic Impact of Heritable Physical Traits: Hot Parents, Rich Kid?","Daniel S. Hamermesh, Anwen Zhang","Since the mapping of the human genome in 2004, biologists have demonstrated genetic links to the expression of several income-enhancing physical traits. To illustrate how heredity produces intergenerational economic effects, this study uses one trait, beauty, to infer the extent to which parents’ physical characteristics transmit inequality across generations. Analyses of a large-scale longitudinal dataset in the U.S., and a much smaller dataset of Chinese parents and children, show that a one standard-deviation increase in parents’ looks is associated with a 0.4 standard-deviation increase in their child’s looks. A large data set of U.S. siblings shows a correlation of their beauty consistent with the same expression of their genetic similarity, as does a small sample of billionaire siblings. Coupling these estimates with parameter estimates from the literatures describing the impact of beauty on earnings and the intergenerational elasticity of income suggests that one standard-deviation difference in parents’ looks generates a 0.06 standard-deviation difference in their adult child’s earnings, which amounts to additional annual earnings in the U.S. of about $2300.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32086,32086,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024

Furthermore, the protection double majors experience is more pronounced when the two majors are more distantly related, highlighting the importance of diverse skill sets.

Durables and Size-Dependence in the Marginal Propensity to Spend,"Martin Beraja, Nathan Zorzi","Stimulus checks have become an increasingly important policy tool in recent U.S. recessions. How does the households' marginal propensity to spend (MPX) vary as checks become larger? To quantify this size-dependence in the MPX, we augment a canonical model of durable spending by introducing a smooth adjustment hazard. We discipline this hazard by matching a rich set of micro moments. We find that the MPX declines slowly with the size of checks. In contrast, the MPX is flatter in a purely state-dependent model of durables, and declines sharply in a two-asset model of non-durables. Finally, we embed our spending model into an open-economy heterogeneous-agent New-Keynesian model. In a typical recession, a large check of $2,000 increases output by 25 cents per dollar, compared to 37 cents for a $300 check. Large checks thus remain effective but extrapolating from the response out of small checks overestimates their impact.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32080,32080,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024

In addition to corroborating previous findings in the literature (hedonic asymmetry/hedonic loss aversion, hedonic adaptation and motivated beliefs), we provide novel results that extend the literature in four dimensions. First, happiness responds to changes relative to both the political status quo (i.e., the incumbent presidential party) and the expected electoral outcome, providing support for two major hypotheses regarding reference point formation. Individuals exhibit hedonic loss aversion to deviations from expectations, but hedonic loss neutrality to changes from the status quo. Second, the speed of hedonic adaptation to deviations from the status quo is significantly slower than the speed of hedonic adaptation to surprises. Third, expectations affect happiness in a nonlinear way, consistent with Gul’s model of disappointment aversion, but contrary to other influential reference-dependent models.

We address this shortcoming by studying the effects of immigration to Brazil during the Age of Mass Migration on its agricultural sector in 1920. This context benefits from the widely recognized value of historical perspective in studies of the effects of immigration. But unlike studies that focus on the United States to understand the effects of migration from poor to rich countries, our context is informative of developing countries' experience because Brazil in this period was unique among major migrant destinations as a low-income country with a large agricultural sector and weak institutions. Instrumenting for a municipality's immigrant share using the interaction of aggregate immigrant inflows and the expansion of Brazil's railway network, we find that a greater immigrant share in a municipality led to an increase in farm values. We show that the bulk of the effect of immigration can be explained by more intense cultivation of land, which we attribute to temporary immigrants exerting greater labor effort than natives. Finally, we find that it is unlikely that immigration's effect on agriculture slowed Brazil's structural transformation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32083,32083,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
Non-Linear Inflation Dynamics in Menu Cost Economies,"Andres Blanco, Corina Boar, Callum J. Jones, Virgiliu Midrigan","Canonical menu cost models, when parameterized to match the micro-price data, cannot reproduce the extent to which the fraction of price changes increases with inflation. They also predict implausibly large menu costs and misallocation in the presence of strategic complementarities. We resolve these shortcomings by extending the multi-product menu cost model along two dimensions. First, the products sold by a firm are imperfect substitutes. Second, strategic complementarities are at the firm, not product level. In contrast to standard models, the fraction of price changes increases rapidly with the size of monetary shocks, so our model implies a non-linear Phillips curve.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32094,32094,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
Policy Responses to Tax Competition: An Introduction,"David R. Agrawal, James M. Poterba, Owen M. Zidar","This paper catalogues policies that have been deployed by jurisdictions seeking to mitigate the effects of tax competition.  There are many instruments in this policy arsenal, since the tax base associated with a particular tax instrument may be affected by multiple policy choices, including some such as capital controls and development incentives that are outside the traditional realm of tax policy.   This paper describes sixteen instruments that both federal and sub-federal governments have adopted in an effort to limit tax competition.  It classifies them into three groups: those that can be pursued unilaterally, those that require bilateral or multilateral agreement, and those that require action by an external actor such as an overarching government.  It also discusses the set of economic responses that are relevant to the evaluation of these policies, and then summarizes new evidence on the impact of a subset of these policy instruments in the United States and several other nations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32090,32090,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
Diminishing Marginal Utility Revisited,"Miles S. Kimball, Daniel Reck, Fudong Zhang, Fumio Ohtake, Yoshiro Tsutsui","How quickly does marginal utility fall with increasing consumption? It depends on the dimension along which we consider concavity of the utility function. This paper estimates the distribution of heterogeneous curvature parameters in individuals’ utility functions from hypothetical choice data, while accounting for survey response error. Types of curvature examined include relative risk aversion, intertemporal substitution, the reciprocal of the altruism elasticity, and a new measure of inequality aversion, which queries how much more a dollar means to a poor family than to a rich family.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32077,32077,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
Value Chain Microfinance,"Lorenzo Casaburi, Jack Willis","We study the provision of financial services to small firms, consumers, and workers in developing countries as part of value chain relationships: value chain microfinance (VCMF). We first explore how VCMF can both overcome barriers to financial access – including asymmetric information, enforcement, and behavioral biases – and strengthen value chains, but also how it can introduce new challenges. We then review a recent empirical literature at the intersection of value chains and microfinance studying the demand for and effects of VCMF in credit, insurance, and savings markets. We conclude by highlighting promising directions for future work.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32085,32085,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
Cash Transfers for Child Development: Experimental Evidence from India,"Jeffrey Weaver, Sandip Sukhtankar, Paul Niehaus, Karthik Muralidharan","Despite significant economic growth, child development outcomes in India remain poor. Using a large-scale experiment in which randomly-selected mothers receive cash transfers for the first two years of their child's life, we examine the relationship between income and child development in the Indian state of Jharkhand. Treated mothers and children experienced large increases in nutritional intake, including increases in caloric consumption of 9.6-15.5%. However, child anthropometric indicators improved only in areas with low rates of open defecation. These results suggest that poor sanitation is a key explanatory factor for the poor translation of increases in income into child growth in India.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32093,32093,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
User Rights for Ocean Ecosystem Conservation,Gary D. Libecap,"Non-target marine fish species and ocean ecosystems are increasingly valuable. Ongoing efforts to preserve them emphasize spatial controls on human entry and use via Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). They cover 7.6% of world oceans and aim for 30% by 2030 under the Convention for Biological Diversity (CBD) and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). MPAs are Pigouvian-style, polluter-pays, controls with rare direct compensation and uncertain projected fishery benefits. Under this policy design, they impose differential economic costs and benefits and likely are inequitable. Absent economic cost/benefit analysis at inauguration, they may be too large, extensive, and restrictive. In the empirical cases below, MPAs are controversial with political pushback, threatening long-term conservation.

Constructing Quarterly Chinese Time Series Usable for Macroeconomic Analysis,"Kaiji Chen, Patrick C.

To explore the primary sources of these fluctuations, we construct a comprehensive dataset of GDP and its components in both nominal and real terms at a quarterly frequency. Applying two SVAR models to this dataset, we uncover the principal drivers of China's economic fluctuations across different episodes.

Energy Transitions in Regulated Markets,"Gautam Gowrisankaran, Ashley Langer, Mar Reguant","Natural gas has replaced coal as the dominant fuel for U.S. electricity generation. However, U.S. states that regulate electric utilities have retired coal more slowly than others. We build a structural model of rate-of-return regulation during an energy transition where utilities face tradeoffs between lowering costs and maintaining coal capacity. We find that the current regulatory structure retires only 45% as much coal capacity as a cost minimizer. A regulated utility facing a carbon tax does not lower carbon emissions immediately but retires coal similarly to the social planner. Alternative regulations with faster transitions clash with affordability and reliability goals.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32088,32088,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
Universal Portfolio Shrinkage,"Bryan T.

Our universal portfolio shrinkage approximator (UPSA) is given in closed form, is easy to implement, and improves upon existing shrinkage methods. It exhibits an explicit two-fund separation, complementing the Markowitz portfolio with an optimal complexity correction. UPSA does not annihilate the low-variance principal components (PCs) of returns; instead, it optimally reweighs them and produces a stochastic discount factor that substantially improves on its feasible PC-sparse counterparts.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32004,32004,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
Power Flows: Transmission Lines and Corporate Profits,Catherine Hausman,"Economists, energy experts, and policymakers have called for accelerating investment in the U.S. electricity transmission network. Additional transmission lines could better integrate markets, reducing the total cost of electricity generation. They could also allow for the better integration of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, located in areas that traditionally did not have much generation capacity and that are far away from centers of demand. In this paper, I document the magnitude of static allocative inefficiencies induced by transmission congestion in two major U.S. electricity markets. I show that the allocative inefficiencies are rising over time, totaling more than $2 billion in 2022. Moreover, I document an important political economy dimension not yet explored in the literature: the magnitudes of gains and losses from this market integration at some individual firms is surprisingly large: four firms would have experienced a collective $1.6 billion drop in operating profits in 2022 had the market been integrated. I then tie some of these firms to reports of transmission hold-up in these markets. I argue that understanding firm-level gains and losses is just as important as understanding overall inefficiencies, particularly in an environment where incumbents may have the power to block new lines.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32091,32091,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
The Predictive Power of the Term Spread and Financial Variables for Economic Activity across Countries,"Menzie D. Chinn, Laurent Ferrara","In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the moments of the yield curve (or alternatively, the term spread) as a predictor of future economic activity, defined as either recessions, or industrial production growth. In this paper, we re-examine the evidence for this predictor for the United States, other high-income countries, as well as selected emerging market economies (Brazil, India, China, South Africa and South Korea), over the 1995-2023 period. We examine the sensitivity of the results to the addition of financial variables that measure other dimensions of financial conditions both domestically and internationally.  Specifically, we account for financial conditions indexes (Arrigoni, et al., 2022), the debt service ratio (Borio, et al., 2020), and foreign term spreads (Ahmed and Chinn, 2023). We find that foreign term spreads and the debt service ratio in many cases yield substantially better predictive power, in terms of in-sample fit using proportion of variance explained. Overall, the predictive power of the yield curve, as well as other financial variables, varies across countries, with particularly little explanatory power in emerging market economies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32084,32084,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
Convenience Yields and Exchange Rate Puzzles,"Zhengyang Jiang, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Hanno Lustig, Jialu Sun","We introduce safe asset demand for dollar-denominated bonds into a tractable incomplete-market model of exchange rates. The convenience yield on dollar bonds enters as a stochastic wedge in the Euler equations for exchange rate determination. This wedge reduces the pass-through from marginal utility shocks to exchange rate movements, resolving the exchange rate volatility puzzle. The wedge also exposes the dollar's exchange rate to convenience yield shocks, giving rise to exchange rate disconnect from macro fundamentals and a quantitatively important driver of currency risk premium. This endogenous exposure identifies a novel safe-asset-demand channel by which the Fed's QE impacts the dollar and long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32092,32092,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
Help for the Heartland? The Employment and Electoral Effects of the Trump Tariffs in the United States,"David Autor, Anne Beck, David Dorn, Gordon H. Hanson","We study the economic and political consequences of the 2018-2019 trade war between the United States, China and other US trade partners at the detailed geographic level, exploiting measures of local exposure to US import tariffs, foreign retaliatory tariffs, and US compensation programs. The trade-war has not to date provided economic help to the US heartland: import tariffs on foreign goods neither raised nor lowered US employment in newly-protected sectors; retaliatory tariffs had clear negative employment impacts, primarily in agriculture; and these harms were only partly mitigated by compensatory US agricultural subsidies. Consistent with expressive views of politics, the tariff war appears nevertheless to have been a political success for the governing Republican party. Residents of regions more exposed to import tariffs became less likely to identify as Democrats, more likely to vote to reelect Donald Trump in 2020, and more likely to elect Republicans to Congress. Foreign retaliatory tariffs only modestly weakened that support.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32082,32082,Jan-24,NBER,1/29/2024
Physical and transition risk premiums in euro area corporate bond markets,"Joost Victor Bats, Giovanna Bua, Daniel Kapp","The European Union plays a prominent role in climate regulations initiatives, this commitment likely implies that climate risk premiums look different in Europe compared to the rest of the world. This paper examines the pricing implications of climate risks in euro area corporate bond markets, focusing on physical and transition risk. Using climate news as a gauge for systematic climate risk, we find a significant pricing effect of physical risk in long-term bonds, with investors demanding higher returns on bonds exposed to physical risk shocks. The estimated physical risk premium is 34 basis points, indicating increased awareness and hedging demand after the Paris Agreement. Transition risk premiums are smaller and less significant, reflecting the ongoing transition to a low-carbon economy. Our findings contribute to understanding climate risk pricing in the European bond markets, highlighting the importance of physical risk and the evolving nature of investor demand for climate-resilient assets.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2899~4710d4cecd.en.pdf?ceb47d4721da0c86982310ce76273bd2,2899,31-Jan-24,ECB,1/31/2024
The impact of macroeconomic and monetary policy shocks on credit risk in the euro area corporate sector,"Marco Lo Duca, Diego Moccero, Fabio Parlapiano","We analyse the impact of macroeconomic and monetary policy shocks on corporate credit risk as measured by firms’ probabilities of default (PDs) for the four largest euro area countries. We estimate the impact of shocks on one-year PDs using local projections (LP). For the period 2014-19, we find that aggregate shocks significantly affect the dynamics of credit risk. An adverse supply shock leads to a deterioration of firms’ riskiness 10 per cent above the average PD. Contractionary monetary policy shocks exert similar, but delayed effects. Firms’ responses to shocks vary depending on their characteristics and degree of financial constraints. Smaller firms are affected to a larger degree. Firms’ outstanding indebtedness and debt repayment capacity are an important transmission channel for aggregate shocks, but the accumulation of cash reserves helps building resilience.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2897~449ca98c99.en.pdf?f4e4337ea5e33262021b44e35b0d691c,2897,30-Jan-24,ECB,1/31/2024
Deposit market concentration and monetary transmission: evidence from the euro area,Stephen Kho,"I study the transmission of monetary policy to deposit rates in the euro area with a focus on asymmetries and the role of banking sector concentration. Using a local projections framework with 2003-2023 country-level and bank-level data for thirteen euro area member states, I find that deposit rates respond symmetrically to an unexpected tightening or easing of monetary policy. However, more concentrated domestic banking sectors do pass-on unexpected monetary tightening (easing) more slowly (quickly) than less concentrated banking sectors, which contributes to a temporary divergence of deposit rates across the euro area. These results suggest that heterogeneity in the degree of banking sector concentration matters for the transmission of monetary policy to deposit rates, which in turn may affect banking sector profitability.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2896~92bba6983d.en.pdf?da4b3ef23e1577b867b9cdc9e463d089,2896,29-Jan-24,ECB,1/31/2024
Satellites turn “concrete”: tracking cement with satellite data and neural networks,"Alexandre d’Aspremont, Simon Ben Arous, Jean-Charles Bricongne, Benjamin Lietti, Baptiste Meunier","This paper exploits daily infrared images taken from satellites to track economic activity in advanced and emerging countries. We first develop a framework to read, clean, and exploit satellite images. Our algorithm uses the laws of physics (Planck’s law) and machine learning to detect the heat produced by cement plants in activity. This allows us to monitor in real-time whether a cement plant is working. Using this information on around 500 plants, we construct a satellite-based index tracking activity. We show that using this satellite index outperforms benchmark models and alternative indicators for nowcasting the production of the cement industry as well as the activity in the construction sector. Comparing across methods, we find neural networks yields significantly more accurate predictions as they allow to exploit the granularity of our daily and plant-level data.

Blinded Versus Unblinded Review: A Field Study Comparing the Equity of Peer-Review,"Timothy J. Pleskac, Ellie Kyung, Gretchen Chapman, Oleg Urminsky","Blinded review is often proposed as a solution to potential inequities in meritbased evaluations. Yet, an equitable merit-based evaluation should also be reliable and valid. We evaluated the equity of blinded and unblinded review in a high-stakes field experiment during peer-review of submissions for an academic conference. Each conference submission received double-blind peer-reviews with reviewer and author identities withheld and single-blind peer-reviews with only reviewer identities withheld. We found that both systems yielded evaluations with moderate reliability after averaging across three or more independent reviewers. This level of reliability resulted in the review systems agreeing on 40% of the top submissions. This agreement level suggests that some differences between review systems emerge from noisy human judgment. The comparison also revealed that single-blind reviews favored senior coauthors and disfavored Asian (versus White) authors more than double-blind review. Double-blind reviews slightly favored male authors more than single-blind reviews. For submissions selected for presentation, neither author characteristics nor the review process consistently predicted judged talk quality or popularity. Single- and double-blind review scores similarly predicted subsequent publication. These results imply that preferences based on authors’ characteristics during single-blind review were not based on well-calibrated beliefs, and there was no strong evidence to suggest that knowing the authors’ characteristics would improve peerreview. The results also suggest that double-blind review may also reduce the ability of reviewers to take into consideration when submissions are from under-represented groups.

Digital Information Provision and Behavior Change: Lessons from Six Experiments in East Africa,"Raissa Fabregas, Michael Kremer, Matthew Lowes, Robert On, Giulia Zane","Mobile phone-based informational programs are widely used worldwide, though there is little consensus on how effective they are at changing behavior. We present causal evidence on the effects of six agricultural information programs delivered through text messages in Kenya and Rwanda. The programs shared similar objectives but were implemented by three different organizations and varied in content, design, and target population. With administrative outcome data for tens of thousands of farmers across all experiments, we are sufficiently powered to detect small effects in real input purchase choices. Combining the results of all experiments through a meta-analysis, we find that the odds ratio for following the recommendations is 1.22 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.29). We cannot reject that impacts are similar across experiments and for two different agricultural inputs. There is little evidence of message fatigue, but the effects diminish over time. Providing more granular information, supplementing the texts with in-person calls, or varying the messages’ framing did not significantly increase impacts, but message repetition had modest positive effects.

The effect of new housing supply in structural models: a forecasting performance evaluation,Stefan Girstmair,"This paper investigates the importance of including data on new housing supply in Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models in forecasting the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), focusing on the U.S. While existing models have added a financial sector and real estate sector, they have largely overlooked housing supply. I develop an extended DSGE model that includes both the financial sector and endogenous housing supply and show that forecasting accuracy significantly improves when data on new houses is included. Robustness checks confirm the importance of these additions to the model. The findings highlight the necessity of combining model extension and housing supply data for accurate forecasting during economic crises. I identify negative housing demand shocks and escalating adjustment costs as primary drivers of the GFC, propagating into the real economy and accelerating through the financial sector.

Inflation heterogeneity across households,"Regina Kiss, Georg Strasser","This paper studies the nature, evolution, and sources of inflation heterogeneity across households in France and Germany. Inflation differences are large and persistent. The two main sources of inflation heterogeneity are spatial differences in the prices paid for the same product and differences in the household-specific variety choice within a category. Income heterogeneity by itself is not a relevant determinant of inflation heterogeneity, but due to its correlation with household behaviour, a significant and timevarying inflation difference between income groups emerges. Substitution is strongly behaviour-driven and largely detached from the relative price. The dispersion of the household-level elasticity of substitution does not fully account for the heterogeneity of substitution behaviour. Substitution does not reduce the dispersion of inflation, confirming the central role of preference heterogeneity in inflation measurement.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2898~29405f932f.en.pdf?bfc08f8845c89cad086b956e77f45ddb,2898,30-Jan-24,ECB,1/31/2024

We derive a simple condition that determines whether an MNE’s plants are substitutes or complements. This condition is shaped by the relative size of (i) the cross-firm elasticity of demand the MNE faces for its goods and (ii) the within-firm elasticity of labor substitution across the MNE’s plants.

The role of comovement and time-varying dynamics in forecasting commodity prices,"Anastasia Allayioti, Fabrizio Venditti","Commodity prices co-move, but the strength of this co-movement changes over time due to structural factors, like changing energy intensity in production and consumption as well as changing composition of underlying shocks. This paper explores whether econometric models that exploit this co-movement and account for parameter instability provide more accurate point and density forecasts of ten major commodity indices viz-a-viz constant coefficient models. Improvements in point forecast accuracy are small, with predictability varying substantially across forecast horizons and commodity indices, but they are large and significant in terms of density forecasting.

Total reported crimes are unchanged, masking these opposing effects. We provide evidence that reduced Hispanic reporting is the key driver of increased victimization.

What drives banks’ credit standards? An analysis based on a large bank-firm panel,"Donata Faccia, Franziska Hünnekes, Petra Köhler-Ulbrich","In this paper we build a unique dataset to study how banks decide which firms to lend to and how this decision depends on their own situation and the characteristics of their borrowers. We find that weaker capitalised banks adjust their credit standards more than healthier banks, especially for firms with a higher default risk. We also show how credit standards change in reaction to two specific macroeconomic developments, namely an increase in bank funding costs and a sudden deterioration in banks’ corporate loan portfolios. Here we find that weaker banks respond more forcefully by tightening their credit standards more than better capitalised banks. This development is particularly pronounced when banks are linked to riskier firms. Insofar, we provide evidence of heterogeneity in the bank lending channel, depending on the situation of the lenders and the borrowers.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2902~278590619d.en.pdf?9b8f76f149e250b4951f1e2b197318aa,2902,5-Feb-24,ECB,2/5/2024
Lives vs. Livelihoods: The Impact of the Great Recession on Mortality and Welfare,"Amy Finkelstein, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, Frank Schilbach, Jonathan Zhang","We leverage spatial variation in the severity of the Great Recession across the United States to examine its impact on mortality and to explore implications for the welfare consequences of recessions. We estimate that an increase in the unemployment rate of the magnitude of the Great Recession reduces the average, annual age-adjusted mortality rate by 2.3 percent, with effects persisting for at least 10 years. Mortality reductions appear across causes of death and are concentrated in the half of the population with a high school degree or less. We estimate similar percentage reductions in mortality at all ages, with declines in elderly mortality thus responsible for about three-quarters of the total mortality reduction. Recession-induced mortality declines are driven primarily by external effects of reduced aggregate economic activity on mortality, and recession-induced reductions in air pollution appear to be a quantitatively important mechanism. Incorporating our estimates of pro-cyclical mortality into a standard macroeconomics framework substantially reduces the welfare costs of recessions, particularly for people with less education, and at older ages where they may even be welfare-improving.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32110,32110,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
Information-Constrained Coordination of Economic Behavior,"Guy Aridor, Rava Azeredo da Silveira, Michael Woodford","We analyze a coordination game with information-constrained players. The players' actions are based on a noisy compressed representation of the game's payoffs in a particular case, where the compressed representation is a latent state learned by a variational autoencoder (VAE). Our generalized VAE is optimized to trade off the average payoff obtained over a distribution of possible games against a measure of the congruence between the agent's internal model and the statistics of its environment.  We apply our model to the coordination game in the experiment of Frydman and Nunnari (2023), and show that it offers an explanation for two salient features of the experimental evidence: both the relatively continuous variation in the players' action probabilities with changes in the game payoffs, and the dependence of the degree of stochasticity of players' choices on the range of game payoffs encountered on different trials. Our approach also provides an account of the way in which play should gradually adjust to a change in the distribution of game payoffs that are encountered, offering an explanation for the history-dependent play documented by Arifovic et al. (2013).",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32113,32113,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
How Do Surrogates Make Treatment Decisions for Patients with Dementia? An Experimental Survey Study,"Lauren Hersch Nicholas, Kenneth M. Langa, Scott D. Halpern, Mario Macis","Despite the growing need for surrogate decision-making for older adults, little is known about how surrogates make decisions and whether advance directives would change decision-making. We conducted a nationally representative experimental survey that cross-randomized cognitive impairment, gender, and characteristics of advance care planning among hospitalized older adults through a series of vignettes. Our study yielded three main findings: first, respondents were much less likely to recommend life-sustaining treatments for patients with dementia, especially after personal exposure. Second, respondents were more likely to ignore patient preferences for life-extending treatment when the patient had dementia, and choose unwanted life-extending treatments for patients without dementia. Third, in scenarios where the patient's wishes were unclear, respondents were more likely to choose treatments that matched their own preferences. These findings underscore the need for improved communication and decision-making processes for patients with cognitive impairment and highlight the importance of choosing a surrogate decision-maker with similar treatment preferences.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32116,32116,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
The Determinants of Declining Internal Migration,"William W. Olney, Owen Thompson","Internal migration in the United States has declined substantially over the past several decades, which has important implications for individual welfare, macroeconomic adjustments, and other key outcomes. This paper studies the determinants of internal migration and how they have changed over time. We use administrative data from the IRS covering the universe of bilateral moves between every Commuting Zone (CZ) in the country over a 23 year period. This data is linked to information on local wage levels and home prices, and we estimate bilateral migration determinants in rich regression specifications that contain CZ-pair fixed effects. Consistent with theoretical predictions, results show that migration is decreasing with origin wages and destination home prices, and is increasing with destination wages and origin home prices. We then examine the contributions of earnings and home prices to the noted overall decline in internal migration. These analyses show that wages on their own would have led to an increase in migration rates, primarily because migrants are increasingly responsive to high earnings levels in potential destination CZs. However, these wage effects have been more than offset by housing related factors, which have increasingly impeded internal mobility. In particular, migration has become much less responsive to housing prices in the origin CZ, such that many households that would have left in response to high home prices several decades ago now choose to stay.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32123,32123,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
CEO Compensation and Cash-Flow Shocks: Evidence from Changes in Environmental Regulations,"Seungho Choi, Ross Levine, Raphael Jonghyeon Park, Simon Xu","This paper investigates how shocks to expected cash flows influence CEO incentive compensation. Exploiting changes in compliance with environmental regulations as shocks to expected future cash flows, we find that adverse shocks typically prompt corporate boards to recalibrate CEO compensation to reduce risk-taking incentives. However, this pattern is not uniform. Financially distressed firms exhibit milder reductions in compensation convexity, with some even increasing it, suggesting a “gambling for resurrection” strategy. Moreover, the strength of corporate governance influences shareholders’ capacity to align executive incentives with shareholder risk preferences following unanticipated changes in the stringency of environmental regulations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32101,32101,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024

Did Violence Against Asian-Americans Rise in 2020? Evidence from a Novel Approach to Measuring Potentially Racially-Motivated Attacks,"Aleksei Knorre, Britte Van Tiem, Aaron Chalfin","Did anti-Asian violence rise after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic? Efforts to answer this question are compromised by the inherent difficulty of measuring racially-motivated crimes as well as concerns that reporting of racially-motivated hate crimes may have changed due to their increased salience during the pandemic. We pursue an alternative approach to studying whether anti-Asian violence rose after March 2020 that addresses each of these concerns. Using data from the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System, we study inter-race violence occurring in public spaces. While public violence declined among all Americans after March 2020, the share of public violence directed at Asian-Americans by people who were previously unknown to them – or were acquaintances – rose more than it did for other Americans. While this relationship did not hold among an auxiliary sample of large US cities, the national evidence is consistent with a modest increase in racially- motivated violence directed towards Asian-Americans.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32121,32121,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
Education Inequalities in Latin America and the Caribbean,"Raquel Fernández, Carmen Pagés, Miguel Szekely, Ivonne Acevedo","Education is a crucial asset for a country’s economic prospects and for its inhabitants.

In this paper, we study education inequality in LAC (both in quantity and quality), assess how it emerges and amplifies or dampens existing inequalities, and examine the interaction of education inequality with other forms of inequality, primarily income and labor market outcomes.

Difference-in-Differences in the Marketplace,"Robert Minton, Casey B. Mulligan","Price theory says that the most important effects of policy and technological change are often found beyond their first point of contact.  This appears opposed to econometric methods that rule out spillovers of one person’s treatment on another’s outcomes.  This paper uses the industry model from price theory to represent the statistical concepts of treatments and controls.  When treated and control observations are in the same market, the controls are indirectly affected by the treatment.  Moreover, even the effect of the treatment on the treated reveals only part of the consequence for the treated of treating the entire market, which is often the parameter of interest.  Marshall’s Laws of Derived Demand provide a guide for empirical work: precise price-theoretic interpretations of the direct and spillover effects of a treatment, the quantitative relationships between them, and how they correspond to the scale and substitution effects emphasized in price theory.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32111,32111,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024

Copyright Policy Options for Generative Artificial Intelligence,Joshua S. Gans,"New generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, including large language models and image generators, have created new challenges for copyright policy as such models may be trained on data that includes copy-protected content. This paper examines this issue from an economics perspective and analyses how different copyright regimes for generative AI will impact the quality of content generated as well as the quality of AI training. A key factor is whether generative AI models are small (with content providers capable of negotiations with AI providers) or large (where negotiations are prohibitive). For small AI models, it is found that giving original content providers copyright protection leads to superior social welfare outcomes compared to having no copyright protection. For large AI models, this comparison is ambiguous and depends on the level of potential harm to original content providers and the importance of content for AI training quality. However, it is demonstrated that an ex-post `fair use' type mechanism can lead to higher expected social welfare than traditional copyright regimes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32106,32106,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
Who Pays the Bill? Distributional and Fiscal Consequences of Elevated Inflation in Thailand,"Piyaporn Chote, Corinne C Delechat, Thanaphol Kongphalee, Vatsal Nahata, Mouhamadou Sy, Pym Manopimoke, Tamon Yungvichit","This paper analyzes the distributional impacts of inflation in Thailand. For that aim, the paper uses rich micro-survey data on 46,000 Thai households to study the effect of the recent elevated inflation on poverty, its distributional effects on different income levels, and the fiscal cost to compensate households from real income losses. To study the multidimensional impact of inflation, the paper also studies how inflation differentially affects households through the consumption, income, and wealth channel. The analysis shows that under a baseline scenario, poverty in Thailand could increase by 1.3 percentage points—about 900,000 people—in the absence of government intervention. Targeted fiscal support to only compensate households that are below the national poverty line from rising inflation amount to 0.05 percent of GDP. However, fiscal support to compensate relatively rich households, defined as those above the median of the income distribution, amount to 1.4 percent of GDP. Moreover, due to high levels of debt, richer households benefit from inflation relative to poorer households. Finally, the paper also delves into policy responses undertaken by the Thai government and Asian and emerging economies to mitigate elevated inflation.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/02/Who-Pays-the-Bill-Distributional-and-Fiscal-Consequences-of-Elevated-Inflation-in-Thailand-544396,WPIEA2024022,"Fri, 02 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/5/2024
Is Schumpeter Right? Fintech and Economic Growth,Serhan Cevik,"The rise of fintech is revolutionizing the financial landscape, with products and companies advancing innovative technologies to improve and automate financial services. In this paper, I use a novel dataset and implement a dynamic modelling to investigate the relationship between fintech and economic growth in a panel of 198 countries over the period 2012–2020. This cross-country approach—utilizing direct measures of fintech and dealing with potential endogeneity—provides interesting empirical insights. First, the impact magnitude and statistical significance of fintech on real GDP per capita growth depend on the type of instrument (digital lending vs. digital capital raising). While digital lending has a statistically significant positive effect on economic growth, digital capital raising has a large but insignificant effect. Second, the overall impact of fintech including all instruments is positive and statistically significant because of the overwhelming share of digital lending in total. Finally, while the positive relationship between fintech and growth is stronger in magnitude in advanced economies, the statistical significance of this effect is higher in developing countries. Taken as a whole, these results confirm Schumpeter’s prediction that financial innovation can promote growth, but not every type of fintech becomes an accelerator.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/02/Is-Schumpeter-Right-Fintech-and-Economic-Growth-544390,WPIEA2024020,"Fri, 02 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/5/2024
"Keeping Up with the Jansens: Causal Peer Effects on Household Spending, Beliefs and Happiness","Maarten van Rooij, Olivier Coibion, Dimitris Georgarakos, Bernardo Candia, Yuriy Gorodnichenko","How strong are peer effects on the beliefs and spending decisions of individuals? We use a randomized control study in which treated households are told about either average income or debt of individuals like them to assess how peer effects influence their beliefs and spending. The information treatments are successful at moving respondents’ beliefs about peers’ incomes and debt levels. We find that individuals with exogenously higher perceived relative income become more opposed to redistribution and increase the amount of time they spend socializing with peers. In addition, we find some evidence of reallocative “keeping up with the Joneses” on spending, as those who learn their peers earn more than they thought tend to reallocate their spending toward durable goods and away from non-durables. However, the quantitative magnitude of peer effects on spending is small in the months following the information experiment. Peer effects also matter for labor supply decisions and ex-post employment outcomes. Finally, believing that one earns more than peers causally leads to large positive effects on happiness, above and beyond effects coming from spending more time with peers, changing beliefs about redistribution, or changes in spending patterns.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32107,32107,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024

What makes a job better? Survey evidence from job changers,Katherine Lim and Mike Zabek,"Changes in pay and benefits alone incorrectly predict self-assessed changes in overall job quality 30 percent of the time, according to survey evidence from job changers. Job changers also place more emphasis on their interest in their work than they do on pay and benefits in evaluating whether their new job is better. Parents particularly emphasize work-life balance, and we find some indications that mothers value it more than fathers. Improvements in pay are highly correlated with improvements in other amenities for workers with less education but not for workers with a bachelor's degree or more. The higher positive correlation implies that differences in pay and benefits understate differences in total job quality to a greater degree among workers with less education.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/what-makes-a-job-better-survey-evidence-from-job-changers.htm,2024-004,Feb-24,FED-BOARD,2/5/2024
How Learning About Harms Impacts the Optimal Rate of Artificial Intelligence Adoption,Joshua S. Gans,This paper examines recent proposals and research suggesting that AI adoption should be delayed until its potential harms are properly understood. It is shown that conclusions regarding the social optimality of delayed AI adoption are sensitive to assumptions regarding the process by which regulators learn about the salience of particular harms. When such learning is by doing -- based on the real-world adoption of AI -- this generally favours acceleration of AI adoption to surface and react to potential harms more quickly. This case is strengthened when AI adoption is potentially reversible. The paper examines how different conclusions regarding the optimality of accelerated or delayed AI adoption influence and are influenced by other policies that may moderate AI harm.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w32105,32105,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
Campaigning Against Populism Emotions and Information in Real Election Campaigns,"Cesi Cruz, Julien Labonne, Francesco Trebbi","Populist politicians have leveraged direct connections with voters to win elections worldwide, often using emotional rather than policy appeals. Do these forms of campaigning work for programmatic politicians as well? We partner with a mainstream opposition political party to implement a field experiment during the 2019 Philippine Senatorial election to test the effectiveness of: (i) direct in-person appeals providing policy information; (ii) the addition of an activity designed to engender positive emotion. We show that direct engagement providing policy information increases vote share for the party, even in a clientelistic context. Additionally, while the emotional activity increases engagement with the campaign in the short term, the information-only treatment was more effective. Last, we present evidence that the treatments operated through learning and persuasion channels: treated voters were more likely to know the party, more certain about their knowledge, and gave higher ratings to the party’s quality and proposed policies.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32112,32112,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024

Credible Numbers: A Procedure for Reporting Statistical Precision in Parameter Estimates,"Nicolas Astier, Frank A.

This practice misses the opportunity to use rounding rules that convey statistical precision. Using insights from the testing statistical hypotheses of equivalence literature, we propose a methodology that only reports decimal digits in a parameter estimate that reject a hypothesis of statistical equivalence. Applying this methodology to all articles published in the American Economic Review between 2000 and 2022, we find that over 60% of the printed digits in coefficient estimates do not convey statistically meaningful information according to our definition of a significant digit. If one additional digit beyond the last significant digit is reported for each coefficient estimate, then approximately one-third of the printed digits in our sample would not be reported.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32124,32124,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024

Does Defensive Gun Use Deter Crime?,"John J. Donohue, Alex Oktay, Amy L. Zhang, Matthew Benavides","We study the opposing deterrent and enabling effects of guns carried by law-abiding citizens on violent crime, using the location of shooting ranges as an instrument. Our incident-level data based on admittedly imperfect data from the Gun Violence Archive suggests that defensive gun use (DGU) by crime victims may decrease the probability of their injury or death, while increasing the risk of death or injury by the criminal suspects. However, in the aggregate, higher numbers of defensive gun uses—which proxies for more gun carrying and use—are associated with higher numbers of violent crimes, injuries, and fatalities among victims and suspects alike. We hypothesize that this equilibrium effect arises because more guns being carried and used by citizens produce more incentive and opportunities for criminals to acquire guns, leading to a commensurate increase in the incidence and lethality of crime. In summary, our analysis supports the conclusion that the widespread carrying and use of guns is overall more likely to enable violent crimes than to deter them.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32108,32108,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024

We resolve these shortcomings by extending the multiproduct menu cost model along two dimensions. First, the products sold by a firm are imperfect substitutes. Second, strategic complementarities are at the firm, not product level. In contrast to standard models, the fraction of price changes increases rapidly with the size of monetary shocks, so our model implies a non-linear Phillips curve.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/nonlinear-inflation-dynamics-in-menu-cost-economies.htm,2024-005,Feb-24,FED-BOARD,2/5/2024

At the same time, macroeconomic information does not have any asymmetric effect on the conditional distribution of term premia. We complement previous findings on the asymmetric predictability of expected rates by showing that monetary policy easing during crises is predictable.

Has Intergenerational Progress Stalled?

At age 36–40, Millennials had a real median household income that was 18 percent higher than that of the previous generation at the same age. This rate of intergenerational progress was slower than that experienced by the Silent Generation (34 percent) and Baby Boomers (27 percent), but similar to that experienced by Generation X (16 percent). Slower progress for Generation X and Millennials is due to their stalled growth in work hours—holding work hours constant, they experienced a greater intergenerational increase in real market income than Baby Boomers. Intergenerational progress for Millennials under age 30 has remained robust as well, although their income growth largely results from higher reliance on their parents. We also find that the higher educational costs incurred by younger generations is far outweighed by their lifetime income gains.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/has-intergenerational-progress-stalled-income-growth-over-five-generations-of-americans.htm,2024-007,Feb-24,FED-BOARD,2/5/2024

Implementing the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood regression and the two-stage least squares with instrumental variable approach, I find that geopolitical developments are not as important as income and geographical distance in determining bilateral trade flows and that democracy fosters international trade and moderates the potential negative impact of geopolitics.

Our analysis indicates that house prices and consumption respond more in supply-inelastic states and in states with large household debt imbalances, where negative housing wealth effects bite more strongly and borrowing constraints become more binding. Moreover, financial stability risks increase sharply in these areas as mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures surge, worsening banks’ balance sheets. Finally, monetary policy may have a stronger effect on housing tenure decisions in supply-inelastic states, where the homeownership rate and price-to-rent ratios decline by more. Our findings stress the importance of regional housing supply conditions in assessing the macrofinancial effects of rising interest rates.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/02/The-Housing-Supply-Channel-of-Monetary-Policy-544046,WPIEA2024023,"Fri, 02 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/5/2024
Evolution of Debt Financing toward Less-Regulated Financial Intermediaries in the United States,"Isil Erel, Eduard Inozemtsev","Nonbank lenders have been playing an increasing role in supplying debt, especially after the Great Recession. How important are the distortions in the greater regulation of banks that differentially limit risk-taking across alternative providers of credit? How might the growing role of nonbanks in credit markets affect financial stability? This selective review addresses these questions and discusses how banks and nonbanks helped provide liquidity to the nonfinancial sector during the COVID-19 pandemic shock. We argue that tighter bank regulation has created incentives for nonbanks to increase their participation in credit markets, a trend that creates concerns about financial stability.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32114,32114,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
Reasons Behind Words: OPEC Narratives and the Oil Market,"Celso Brunetti, Marc Joëts, Valérie Mignon","We analyze the content of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) communications and whether it provides information to the crude oil market. To this end, we derive an empirical strategy which allows us to measure OPEC's public signal and test whether market participants find it credible. Using Structural Topic Models, we analyze OPEC narratives and identify several topics related to fundamental factors, such as demand, supply, and speculative activity in the crude oil market. Importantly, we find that OPEC communication reduces oil price volatility and prompts market participants to rebalance their positions.

Platform Information Provision and Consumer Search: A Field Experiment,"Lu Fang, Yanyou Chen, Chiara Farronato, Zhe Yuan, Yitong Wang","Despite substantial efforts to help consumers search in more intuitive ways, text search remains the predominant tool for product discovery online. In this paper, we explore the effects of visual and textual cues for search refinement on consumer search and purchasing behavior. We collaborate with one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China and study its roll out of a new search tool. When a customer searches for a general term (e.g., “headphones”), the tool suggests refined queries (e.g., “bluetooth headphones” or “noise-canceling headphones”) with the help of images and texts. The search tool was rolled out with a long-run experiment, which allows us to measure its short-run and long-run effects. We find that, although there was no immediate effect on orders or total expenditures, the search tool changed customers’ search and purchasing behavior in the long-run. Customers with access to the new tool eventually increased orders and expenditures compared to those in the control group, especially for non top-selling products. The purchase increase comes from more effective searches,",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32099,32099,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
Optimal Trade Policy with International Technology Diffusion,"Yan Bai, Keyu Jin, Dan Lu, Hanxi Wang","We study optimal dynamic trade policies in an Eaton-Kortum model with technology diffusion through trade. The process of innovation and diffusion is one in which new ideas are combined with insights from others. Trade thus affects technology by determining the distribution from which producers draw their insights. Our theory shows that optimal policies capture a dynamic motive for a country to alter global technology. These policies take into account selection effects, country endowments, and other alterations to trade patterns that affect the degree and quality of diffusion. We provide explicit formulas showing that a Home country would like to subsidize imports from places that improve the quality of learning at Home; or lower its export tax to another country if a) higher productivity in that country is good for the Home, and b) more exports to that country improve the quality of learning and, in turn, the country’s technology.

Whatever-It-Takes Policymaking during the Pandemic,"Kathryn M.E. Dominguez, Andrea Foschi","Central banks across the globe introduced large-scale asset purchase programs to address the unprecedented circumstances experienced during the pandemic. Many of these programs were announced as open-ended to shock-and-awe market participants and restore confidence in financial markets. This paper examines whether these whatever-it-takes announcements had larger effects than announcements with explicit limits on scale. We use a narrative approach to categorize announcements made by twenty-two central banks, and event study, propensity-score-matching, and local projection methods to measure the short-term effects of policy announcements on exchange rates and sovereign bond yields. We find that on average a central bank's first whatever-it-takes announcement lowers 10-year bond yields by an additional 25 basis points relative to size-limited announcements, suggesting that communication of potential policy scale matters. Our results for yields hold for both advanced and emerging economies, while exchange rates go in opposing directions, muting their response when we group all countries together.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32115,32115,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
"The Consequences of Abuse, Neglect and Cyber-bullying on the Wellbeing of the Young","David G. Blanchflower, Alex Bryson","Using cross-sectional data files for the United States we show that difficulties experienced in childhood - so-called Adverse Child Experiences (ACE)s - are strongly and significantly associated with mental health in adulthood. Our evidence is taken from eight Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys from 2009-2023 which contain a special supplement asking respondents to recall abuse in their childhood. We find that poor mental health is on the rise in the United States, particularly among young women. This upward trend among the young is also apparent from the National Health Interview Surveys 1997-2021, the Healthy Minds surveys of 2007-2023 and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) for high school students. We find ACEs are strongly correlated with poor mental health among both the young and older people and the effect is additive. The impact of living with a household member with poor mental health is large relative to other ACEs and is particularly pronounced among younger people. Being bullied, including electronically, is also strongly negatively associated with the wellbeing of high school students. Time spent in front of a screen has been rising over time for the young and has an independent negative impact on their mental health over and above bullying, one which is more pronounced for young women.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32119,32119,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
Effects of Childhood Cognitive and Behavioral Disabilities on Adult Economic Outcomes,"Hope Corman, Kelly Noonan, Nancy Reichman","Developmental disabilities are not rare among U.S. children and rates have been increasing in recent decades. The increases have been driven by cognitive and behavioral disorders.  While some studies have investigated the effects of specific childhood conditions, particularly ADHD, on adult economic outcomes, none has considered the overall effects of cognitive and behavioral disabilities. We address this key gap by rigorously estimating effects of cognitive and behavioral impairments in childhood, which account for the bulk and increasing share of child disability cases in the U.S., on a set of salient adult economic outcomes. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79 Child Supplement, we estimate the effects of low cognitive test scores and high behavior problem scores in childhood on receipt of disability benefits, educational attainment, employment, wages, and access to transportation and credit in adulthood, using household fixed effects models to control for potentially confounding factors that are unobserved. We find significant effects in the expected direction for both cognitive and behavioral childhood disabilities on all outcomes. The findings have important implications for well-being over the life course for a non-trivial share of the U.S. population and their families, government expenditures, and public policy.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32103,32103,Feb-24,NBER,2/5/2024
The Informational Centrality of Banks,"Nathan Foley-Fisher, Gary Gorton, Stéphane Verani","The equity and debt prices of large nonbank firms contain information about the future state of the banking system. In this sense, banks are informationally central. The amount of this information varies over time and over equity and debt. During a financial crisis banks are, by definition of a crisis, at risk of failure. Debt prices became about 50 percent more informative than equity prices about the future state of the banking system during the financial crisis of 2007-2009.

Lives vs. Livelihoods: The Impact of the Great Recession on Mortality and Welfare,"Amy Finkelstein, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, Frank Schilbach, Jonathan Zhang","We leverage spatial variation in the severity of the Great Recession across the United States to examine its impact on mortality and to explore implications for the welfare consequences of recessions. We estimate that an increase in the unemployment rate of the magnitude of the Great Recession reduces the average, annual age-adjusted mortality rate by 2.3 percent, with effects persisting for at least 10 years. Mortality reductions appear across causes of death and are concentrated in the half of the population with a high school degree or less. We estimate similar percentage reductions in mortality at all ages, with declines in elderly mortality thus responsible for about three-quarters of the total mortality reduction. Recession-induced mortality declines are driven primarily by external effects of reduced aggregate economic activity on mortality, and recession-induced reductions in air pollution appear to be a quantitatively important mechanism. Incorporating our estimates of pro-cyclical mortality into a standard macroeconomics framework substantially reduces the welfare costs of recessions, particularly for people with less education, and at older ages where they may even be welfare-improving.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/lives-vs-livelihoods-the-impact-of-the-great-recession-on-mortality-and-welfare/,2024-14,5-Feb-24,BFI,2/9/2024
"Data, Privacy Laws and Firm Production: Evidence from the GDPR","Mert Demirer, Diego Jiménez Hernández, Dean Li, Sida Peng","By regulating how firms collect, store, and use data, privacy laws may change the role of data in production and alter firm demand for information technology inputs. We study how firms respond to privacy laws in the context of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by using seven years of data from a large global cloud-computing provider. Our difference-in-difference estimates indicate that, in response to the GDPR, EU firms decreased data storage by 26% and data processing by 15% relative to comparable U.S. firms, becoming less “data-intensive.” To estimate the costs of the GDPR for firms, we propose and estimate a production function where data and computation serve as inputs to the production of “information.” We find that data and computation are strong complements in production and that firm responses are consistent with the GDPR representing a 20% increase in the cost of data on average. Variation in the firm-level effects of the GDPR and industry-level exposure to data, however, drives significant heterogeneity in our estimates of the impact of the GDPR on production costs.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-02,2024-02,Feb-24,FED-CHICAGO,2/9/2024

Using sectoral data, we find evidence indicating that UK industries with higher proportions of imported inputs from emerging market economies (EMEs) exhibit a flatter Phillips curve. We then build a two-country model with input-output linkages and demonstrate analytically that an increased reliance on imported intermediate goods, serving as a proxy for GVCs, results in a flatter Phillips curve. Additionally, GVC integration affects inflation dynamics through the influence of cyclical forces that shape firms’ marginal costs via terms of trade fluctuations. Specifically, we highlight how the limited business cycle correlation between the UK economy and EMEs reduces the pass-through of domestic shocks to prices.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/global-value-chains-and-the-dynamics-of-uk-inflation,1060,"Fri, 09 Feb 2",BOE,2/9/2024

The Causal Effects of Global Supply Chain Disruptions on Macroeconomic Outcomes: Evidence and Theory,"Xiwen Bai, Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Yiliang Li, Francesco Zanetti","We study the causal effects and policy implications of global supply chain disruptions. We construct a new index of supply chain disruptions from the mandatory automatic identification system data of container ships, developing a novel spatial clustering algorithm that determines real-time congestion from the position, speed, and heading of container ships in major ports around the globe. We develop a model with search frictions between producers and retailers that links spare productive capacity with congestion in the goods market and the responses of output and prices to supply chain shocks. The co-movements of output, prices, and spare capacity yield unique identifying restrictions for supply chain disturbances that allow us to study the causal effects of such disruptions. We document how supply chain shocks drove inflation during 2021 but that, in 2022, traditional demand and supply shocks also played an important role in explaining inflation. Finally, we show how monetary policy is more effective in taming inflation after a global supply chain shock than in regular circumstances.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32098,32098,Feb-24,NBER,2/9/2024
Interest Rate Risk at US Credit Unions,"Grant Rosenberger, Peter Zimmerman","Rising interest rates have prompted concerns about losses on bank assets, especially following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023. In this working paper, we examine whether US credit unions could be subject to similar losses as banks and analyze how their regulatory capital would be affected. We estimate that after realizing losses from assets that have decreased in value and not yet been sold the overall net worth of the credit union industry would have fallen by 40 percent in 2023:Q1. Unrealized losses were most severe at the largest credit unions. Nonetheless, the bulk of deposits at credit unions were insured, suggesting limited risk of an SVB-style run. In addition, credit union deposit rates are relatively insensitive to market interest rates, providing credit unions with a hedge against a rising rate environment. Overall, credit unions’ balance sheet positions seemed to be more resilient to unrealized interest rate risk than banks’.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2403-interest-rate-risk-at-us-credit-unions,24-03,02.05.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,2/9/2024
Competing models of the Bank of England’s liquidity auctions: truthful bidding is a good approximation,Charlotte Grace,"This paper provides a method for comparing the performance of different models of bidding behaviour. It uses data on participants’ bids but does not require data on their values. I find that a model of ‘truthful bidding’ – bidding one’s true value for liquidity – outperforms a conventional model in which bidders shade their bids to maximise their expected surpluses, in the Bank of England’s uniform-price divisible-good liquidity auctions. I provide two possible explanations for this result. First, when bidders are sufficiently risk averse, optimal strategies in the conventional model approximate truthful bidding. For the conventional model, I develop new identifying conditions which allow for risk aversion. I find that the degree of risk aversion required for truthful bidding to be approximately optimal is consistent with that found in studies that are the most similar to my setting. Second, the optimal strategy can be complicated. Truthful bidding is preferable, even for risk neutral bidders, if the cost of calculating what would otherwise be the optimal strategy exceeds around 5% of bidder surplus.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2024/competing-models-of-the-bank-of-englands-liquidity-auctions,1061,"Fri, 09 Feb 2",BOE,2/9/2024
Households' response to the wealth effects of inflation,"Philip Schnorpfeil, Michael Weber, Andreas Hackethal","We study the redistributive effects of surprise inflation combining administrative bank data with an information provision experiment during an episode of historic inflation. On average, households are well-informed about prevailing inflation and are concerned about its impact on their wealth; yet, while many households know about inflation eroding nominal assets, most are unaware of nominal-debt erosion. Once they receive information on the debt-erosion channel, households view nominal debt more positively and increase estimates of their own real net wealth. These changes causally affect actual consumption and hypothetical debt decisions.

We leverage exogenous variation across Colombian municipalities in exposure to a fiscal rule that limits the operating expenditures of local governments.

Second, there is no meaningful impact on local public goods or living standards. Third, the fiscal consolida-tion leads voters to be more satisfied with their local government and to re-elect the incumbent party at higher rates.

Reexamining the 'Role of the Community Reinvestment Act in Mortgage Supply and the U.S. Housing Boom',Kenneth P.

The first peer-reviewed evidence of a causal effect was published by the Review of Financial Studies in a paper (Saadi, 2020) linking the crisis to changes in the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in 1995. A review of that paper, however, shows that it misrepresents the policy changes as having taken effect in mid-1998, 2.5 years after they were implemented. When the correct timing is used, a similar analysis yields no evidence of a relationship between CRA and riskier mortgage lending. Instead, the results are shown to reflect an unrelated confounding event, the first collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market following Russia’s debt default in August 1998.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/reexamining-role-of-community-reinvestment-act-in-mortgage-supply-and-US-housing-boom.htm,2024-009,Feb-24,FED-BOARD,2/9/2024

The macroeconomic effects of global supply chain reorientation,"Daragh Clancy, Donal Smith, Vilém Valenta","Policymakers around the world are encouraging the local production of key inputs to reduce risks from excessive dependencies on foreign suppliers. We analyse the macroeconomic effects of supply chain reorientation through localisation policies, using a global dynamic general equilibrium model. We proxy non-tariff measures, such as the stricter enforcement of regulatory standards, which reduce import quantity but do not directly alter costs and prices. These measures have, so far, been a key component of attempts to reshore production and are an increasingly popular trade policy instrument in general. Focusing on the euro area, we find that localisation policies are inflationary, imply transition costs and generally have a negative long-run effect on aggregate domestic output. The size (and sign) of the impact depends on whether these policies are implemented unilaterally or induce a retaliation from trade partners, and the extent to which they reduce domestic competition and productivity. We provide some recommendations for policymakers considering implementing a localisation agenda.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2903~8bc715c800.en.pdf?8efb3f8dd076fa477fa190805c56946d,2903,8-Feb-24,ECB,2/9/2024

Because laws entrench practices and bind the discretion of policy makers and debt managers alike, subjecting them to public scrutiny, legal reform is a necessary part of any solution to the problem of hidden debt, though it may entail a difficult and time intensive process in many jurisdictions.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/09/The-Legal-Foundations-of-Public-Debt-Transparency-Aligning-the-Law-with-Good-Practices-544450,WPIEA2024029,"Fri, 09 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/9/2024
U.S. Inflation Expectations During the Pandemic,"Euihyun Bae, Andrew Hodge, Anke Weber","This paper studies how and why inflation expectations have changed since the emergence of Covid-19. Using micro-level data from the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, we show that the distribution of consumer expectations at one-year and five-ten year horizons has widened since the surge of inflation during 2021, along with the mean. Persistently high and heterogeneous expectations of consumers with less education and lower income are mainly responsible. A simple model of adaptive learning is able to mimic the change in inflation expectations over time for different demographic groups. The inflation expectations of low income and female consumers are consistent with using less complex forecasting models and are more backward-looking. A medium-scale DSGE model with adaptive learning, estimated during 1965-2022, has a time-varying solution that produces lower forecast errors for inflation than a variant with rational expectations. The estimated model interprets the surge of inflation in 2021 mainly as the result of a price markup shock, which is more persistent and requires a larger and more persistent monetary policy response than under rational expectations.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/09/U-S-544459,WPIEA2024025,"Fri, 09 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/9/2024
"Emissions Reduction, Fiscal Costs, and Macro Effects: A Model-based Assessment of IRA Climate Measures and Complementary Policies","Simon Voigts, Anne-Charlotte Paret","The IMF’s Macroeconomic Model for the Energy Transition (GMMET) is applied to assess the climate-related measures in the U.S. 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Explicitly accouting for corporate income tax funding and assuming no permitting delays for energy-related investment, the measures are expected to cut annual greenhouse gas emissions by 710 MMT by 2030, predominantly driven by more electricity generation from renewables combined with a rising share of electric vehicles. Aggregate output and inflation are not impacted significantly, while the fiscal costs amount to about $700 billion through 2030 (another $120 billion of fixed grants and loans are not modelled). In the presence of investment delays from permitting, emission cuts would be reduced by about a third. We also show that the IRA leaves room for sizable additional emission abatement at very low costs; by targeting electricity generation from coal and methane emissions from oil and gas industries.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/09/Emissions-Reduction-Fiscal-Costs-and-Macro-Effects-A-Model-based-Assessment-of-IRA-Climate-544749,WPIEA2024024,"Fri, 09 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/9/2024
The Impact of Derivatives Collateralization on Liquidity Risk: Evidence from the Investment Fund Sector,"Audrius Jukonis, Elisa Letizia, Linda Rousova","Stricter derivative margin requirements have increased the demand for liquid collateral, but euro area investment funds, which use derivatives extensively, have been reducing their liquid asset holdings. Using transaction-by-transaction derivatives data, we assess whether the current levels of funds’ holdings of cash and other highly liquid assets would be adequate to meet funds’ liquidity needs to cover variation margin calls on derivatives under a range of stress scenarios. The estimates indicate that between 13 percent and 33 percent of euro area funds with sizeable derivatives exposures may not have sufficient liquidity buffers to meet the calls under adverse market shocks. As a result, they are likely to redeem money market fund (MMF) shares, procyclically sell assets, and draw on credit lines, thus amplifying the market dynamics under such stress scenarios. Our findings highlight the importance of further work to assess the potential role of macroprudential policies for nonbanks, particularly regarding liquidity risk in funds.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/09/The-Impact-of-Derivatives-Collateralization-on-Liquidity-Risk-Evidence-from-the-Investment-544453,WPIEA2024026,"Fri, 09 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/9/2024
Carbon Prices and Inflation in the Euro Area,"Maximilian Konradt, Thomas McGregor, Frederik G Toscani","What is the effect of carbon pricing on inflation? This paper shows empirically that the consequences of the European Union’s Emission Trading System (ETS) and national carbon taxation on inflation have been limited in the euro area, so far. This result is supported by analysis based on a panel local projections approach, as well as event studies based on individual countries. Our estimates suggest that carbon taxes raised the price of energy but had limited effects on overall consumer prices. Since future climate policy will need to be much more ambitious compared to what has been observed so far, including the need for larger increases in carbon prices, possible non-linearities might make extrapolating from historical results difficult. We thus also use input-output tables to simulate the mechanical effect of a carbon tax consistent with the EU’s ‘Fit-for-55’ commitments on inflation. The required increase of effective carbon prices from around 40 Euro per ton of CO2 in 2021 to around 150 Euro by 2030 could raise annual euro area inflation by between 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points.

Tariff Rate Uncertainty and the Structure of Supply Chains,"Sebastian Heise, Justin R. Pierce, Georg Schaur, Peter K.

Empirically, we introduce a method for distinguishing between these Japanese versus spot-market (i.e., American) relationships in customs data, show that their use varies intuitively across trading partners and products, and find that Japanese importing from China increases after a reduction in the possibility of a trade war. Extending the standard general equilibrium trade model to encompass potential trade wars and relational contracts, we estimate that eliminating Japanese procurement reduces welfare about a third as much as moving to autarky.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32138,32138,Feb-24,NBER,2/12/2024

We assess attitudes using donations to a randomly assigned group: Italian victims of violence or refugees fleeing wars in Ukraine or African countries. We also employ a novel measure, the share donated in cash. While donations indicated less support for African and Ukrainian refugees compared to Italian victims, the cash measure revealed a stronger prejudice against distant out-groups, with participants giving African refugees a smaller proportion of cash donations. This result was mainly driven by individuals with right-leaning political views. Providing information about immigration policy reforms that give the EU a more substantial role in receiving and allocating refugees had no impact.

Behavioral Responses to Wealth Taxation: Evidence from Colombia,"Juliana Londoño-Vélez, Javier Avila-Mahecha","We study behavioral responses to personal wealth taxes in Colombia. We utilize tax microdata from 1993 to 2016 linked with the leaked Panama Papers to investigate offshoring to the country’s key tax havens. We leverage variation from discrete jumps in tax liability and four major reforms to the wealth tax system, including changes in tax rates and duration, using bunching and difference-in-difference techniques. We find compelling evidence that taxpayers instantly reduce the wealth they declare in response to a wealth tax. Moreover, these effects can persist for years even after the wealth tax is no longer in place, providing the first evidence of a hysteresis effect for a temporary tax policy. The response is driven by misreporting items that authorities cannot cross-verify, such as overstating debt and understating non-third-party-reported business assets. Additionally, the wealthiest taxpayers respond to wealth tax increases by hiding assets in hard-to-track entities in tax havens.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32134,32134,Feb-24,NBER,2/12/2024

Declining Responsiveness at the Establishment Level: Sources and Productivity Implications,"Russell Cooper, John C.

Evidence shows that an important component of this decline is accounted for by the reduction in the response of employment to shocks in US establishments.  Using a plant level dynamic optimization problem as a framework for analysis, four potential reasons for this decline are studied: (i) a change in exogenous processes for profits, (ii) an increase in impatience, (iii) increased market power and (iv) increasing adjustment costs. We identify and quantity the contribution of each of these factors building on  a simulated method of moments estimation of our structural model.  Our results indicate that the reduction in responsiveness largely reflects increased costs of employment adjustment. Changes in market power, as captured by changes in the curvature of the revenue, function play a minimal role.  But, in the presence of rising adjustment costs, measured sales-weighted markups using the recently popular indirect production approach rise substantially, along with rising dispersion and skewness of such measured markups.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32130,32130,Feb-24,NBER,2/12/2024

Applying AI to Rebuild Middle Class Jobs,David Autor,"While the utopian vision of the current Information Age was that computerization would flatten economic hierarchies by democratizing information, the opposite has occurred. Information, it turns out, is merely an input into a more consequential economic function, decision-making, which is the province of elite experts. The unique opportunity that AI offers to the labor market is to extend the relevance, reach, and value of human expertise. Because of AI’s capacity to weave information and rules with acquired experience to support decision-making, it can be applied to enable a larger set of workers possessing complementary knowledge to perform some of the higher-stakes decision-making tasks that are currently arrogated to elite experts, e.g., medical care to doctors, document production to lawyers, software coding to computer engineers, and undergraduate education to professors.

Persuasion and Dissuasion in Political Campaigns: Political Communication and Media Coverage in Senate Races,"Camilo Garcia-Jimeno, Pinar Yildirim","We study the strategic interaction between candidates to office and the print media, exploring the following tension: while the media is instrumental for candidates to communicate with voters, candidates and media outlets have conflicting preferences over the contents of media reporting. We propose a model of bipartisan races where candidates make decisions over the type of constituencies to target with their statements along the campaign trail and media outlets make decisions over how intensely to report about the candidates based on those statements. Different kinds of media reports may persuade or dissuade voters. We develop a methodology to classify news content as suggestive of the target audience of candidate speech, and show how data on media reports and poll results, together with the behavioral implications of the model, can be used to estimate its parameters. We implement this methodology on U.S. Senatorial races for the period 1980-2012, and find that Democratic candidates had stronger incentives to target their messages towards turning out their core supporters than Republicans. We also find that the cost in swing-voter support from targeting core supporters was larger for Democrats than for Republicans.

We present an equilibrium theory where this tension mediates the joint determination of social structure and civil liberties. We show that segregation and unequal treatment sustain each other as coordination failures: citizens choose to segregate along the lines of an arbitrary trait only when the government exercises unequal treatment as a function of the trait, and the government engages in unequal treatment only when citizens choose to segregate based on the trait. We characterize when unequal treatment against a minority or a majority can be sustained, and how equilibrium social cohesiveness and civil liberties respond to the arrival of widespread surveillance technologies, shocks to collective perceptions about the likelihood of threats or the importance of privacy, or to community norms such as codes of silence.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2024/2024-05,2024-05,Feb-24,FED-CHICAGO,2/15/2024

Small Firm Growth and the VAT Threshold Evidence for the UK,"Li Liu, Ben Lockwood, Eddy H.F. Tam","This paper studies the effect of the VAT threshold on firm growth in the UK, using exogenous variation over time in the threshold, combined with turnover bin fixed effects, for identification. We find robust evidence that annual growth in turnover slows by about 1 percentage point when firm turnover gets close to the threshold, with no evidence of higher growth when the threshold is passed. Growth in firm costs shows a similar pattern, indicating that the response to the threshold is likely to be a real response rather than an evasion response. Firms that habitually register even when their turnover is below the VAT threshold (voluntary registered firms) have growth that is unaffected by the threshold, whereas firms that select into the Flat-Rate Scheme have a less pronounced slowdown response than other firms. Similar patterns of turnover and cost growth around the threshold are also observed for non-incorporated businesses. Finally, simulation results clarify the relative contribution of ``crossers"" (firms who eventually register for VAT) and ``non-crossers"" (those who permanently stay below the threshold) in explaining our empirical findings.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/16/Small-Firm-Growth-and-the-VAT-Threshold-Evidence-for-the-UK-544462,WPIEA2024033,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/17/2024
Political Fragility: Coups d’État and Their Drivers,"Aliona Cebotari, Enrique Chueca-Montuenga, Yoro Diallo, Yunsheng Ma, Rima A Turk, Weining Xin, Harold Zavarce","The paper explores the drivers of political fragility by focusing on coups d’état as symptomatic of such fragility. It uses event studies to identify factors that exhibit significantly different dynamics in the runup to coups, and machine learning to identify these stressors and more structural determinants of fragility—as well as their nonlinear interactions—that create an environment propitious to coups. The paper finds that the destabilization of a country’s economic, political or security environment—such as low growth, high inflation, weak external positions, political instability and conflict—set the stage for a higher likelihood of coups, with overlapping stressors amplifying each other. These stressors are more likely to lead to breakdowns in political systems when demographic pressures and underlying structural weaknesses (especially poverty, exclusion, and weak governance) are present or when policies are weaker, through complex interactions. Conversely, strengthened fundamentals and macropolicies have higher returns in structurally fragile environments in terms of staving off political breakdowns, suggesting that continued engagement by multilateral institutions and donors in fragile situations is likely to yield particularly high dividends. The model performs well in predicting coups out of sample, having predicted a high probability of most 2020-23 coups, including in the Sahel region.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/16/Political-Fragility-Coups-dtat-and-Their-Drivers-544943,WPIEA2024034,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/17/2024

It is worth noting that the energy price increases caused by the rise in the effective carbon price to 150 Euro is substantially smaller than the energy price spike seen in 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/09/Carbon-Prices-and-Inflation-in-the-Euro-Area-544465,WPIEA2024031,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/17/2024
Sectoral Debt and Global Dollar Cycles in Developing Economies,"Bada Han, Rashad Ahmed, Joshua Aizenman, Yothin Jinjarak","We explore the role of sectoral debt dynamics in shaping business cycles in a sample of 52 Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) and Frontier Market Economies (FMEs) from 2005 to 2021. Higher household debt levels and growth are associated with significantly slower GDP growth in more developed EMEs but not in less developed EMEs and FMEs. We also examine the relationship between US dollar cycles, sectoral debt levels and growth, and economic activity. Among developed EMEs, higher expected household debt growth magnifies the impact of US dollar fluctuations on economic activity, with significant but less persistent effects on consumption and more persistent effects on investment. Our empirical findings highlight the important role of household debt dynamics in relatively developed EMEs.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/16/Sectoral-Debt-and-Global-Dollar-Cycles-in-Developing-Economies-544447,WPIEA2024030,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/17/2024
Constraints on Trade in the LAC Region,"Rina Bhattacharya, Samuel Pienknagura","This paper studies Latin America and the Caribbean’s (LAC) trade performance in recent years and estimates the salience of key country-specific factors in explaining underperformance in some sub-regions within LAC. First, the paper documents that, while the average country in the region displays aggregate trade values that are consistent with a standard gravity model, there is substantial heterogeneity across sub-regions and product-types. The paper then estimates an augmented gravity specification that includes proxies for the quality of infrastructure, the availability and quality of factors of production, and governance. Results point to infrastructure and customs regulation as key factors explaining undertrading in manufacturing in most sub-regions. Factors of production partly explain South America’s underpeformance in manufacturing while governance explains undertrading across most product groups, but neither set of factors play a significant role in other sub-regions.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/16/Constraints-on-Trade-in-the-LAC-Region-544936,WPIEA2024032,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 ",IMF,2/17/2024
Implications of a U.S. CBDC for International Payments and the Role of the Dollar,Jean Flemming and Ruth Judson,"Technological advances in recent decades have brought about a wave of private-sector innovation in payments and have led central banks to explore a variety of improvements to their payment systems, including the possibility of issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Survey evidence from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) shows that over 90% of central banks are exploring CBDCs (Kosse & Mattei, 2022). The Federal Reserve is also exploring the implications of, and options for, introducing a CBDC.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/implications-of-a-u-s-cbdc-for-international-payments-and-the-role-of-the-dollar-20240216.html,1.01702E+18,16-Feb-24,FED-BOARD-NOTES,2/17/2024
The Arity of Disparity: Updating Disparate Impact  for Modern Fair Lending,"Spencer Caro, Scott Nelson","Plaintiffs often cannot prevail under a disparate impact (“DI”) claim of discrimination unless they show the defendant failed to implement a less discriminatory alternative (“LDA”) to a practice that yields a disparate output across protected classes. Traditional LDA analysis focuses on a singular notion of fairness: parity, or the equality of screening decisions across protected groups. However, recent scholarship highlights that parity is only one of numerous competing notions of fairness that may seem just as compelling as, but be mutually exclusive with, parity. The arity of disparity is larger than DI has acknowledged. We propose formalizing LDA analysis as an explicit constraint on choices over screening models and data inputs. The constraint restricts model-induced disparities in both parity and a competing notion of fairness—accuracy—relative to a “budget” that depends straightforwardly on overall model performance. We also show how this trade-off leads to balancing other notions of fairness, as weighted combinations of parity and accuracy span many other fairness notions in a helpful way. For concreteness, our legal argument and our applied examples focus on DI under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”). We address tension between DI’s traditional focus on parity and ECOA’s statutory emphasis on “credit-worthy” consumers and discuss implications for new frontiers in credit underwriting, including the use of machine learning and alternative data sources.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/the-arity-of-disparity-updating-disparate-impact-for-modern-fair-lending/,2024-18,15-Feb-24,BFI,2/18/2024
"Data, Privacy Laws and Firm Production: Evidence from the GDPR","Mert Demirer, Diego J. Jiménez Hernández, Dean Li, Sida Peng","By regulating how firms collect, store, and use data, privacy laws may change the role of data in production and alter firm demand for information technology inputs. We study how firms respond to privacy laws in the context of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by using seven years of data from a large global cloud-computing provider. Our difference-in-difference estimates indicate that, in response to the GDPR, EU firms decreased data storage by 26% and data processing by 15% relative to comparable US firms, becoming less “data-intensive.” To estimate the costs of the GDPR for firms, we propose and estimate a production function where data and computation serve as inputs to the production of “information."" We find that data and computation are strong complements in production and that firm responses are consistent with the GDPR, representing a 20% increase in the cost of data on average. Variation in the firm-level effects of the GDPR and industry-level exposure to data, however, drives significant heterogeneity in our estimates of the impact of the GDPR on production costs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32146,32146,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
Misallocation and Asset Prices,"Winston Wei Dou, Yan Ji, Di Tian, Pengfei Wang","We develop an endogenous growth model with heterogeneous firms facing financial frictions, where misallocation emerges explicitly as a crucial endogenous state variable and plays a significant role in driving economic growth through the valuation channel. The model illustrates that transient macroeconomic shocks affecting misallocation can yield persistent effects on aggregate growth. In equilibrium, slow-moving misallocation endogenously generates long-run uncertainty about economic growth by distorting innovation decisions. When agents hold recursive preferences, misallocation-driven low-frequency growth fluctuations result in substantial risk premia in capital markets and large losses in consumer welfare. Employing a misallocation measure motivated by the model, we substantiate our findings with empirical evidence showing that misallocation effectively captures low-frequency fluctuations in both aggregate growth and asset returns.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32147,32147,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
Smooth Diagnostic Expectations,"Francesco Bianchi, Cosmin L. Ilut, Hikaru Saijo","We introduce “smooth diagnosticity.” Under smooth diagnosticity, agents over-react to new information defined as the difference between the current information set and a previous information set. Since new information typically changes not just the conditional mean, but also the conditional uncertainty, changes in uncertainty surrounding current and past beliefs affect the severity of the Diagnostic Expectations (DE) distortion. Smooth DE nests the baseline DE of Bordalo et al. (2018) and implies a joint and parsimonious micro-foundation for various properties of survey data: (1) over-reaction of conditional mean to news, (2) stronger over-reaction for weaker signals and longer forecast horizons, and (3) over-confidence in subjective uncertainty. We embed Smooth DE in an analytical RBC model. The model accounts for over-reaction and over-confidence in surveys, as well as three salient properties of the business cycle: (1) asymmetry, (2) countercyclical micro volatility, and (3) countercyclical macro volatility.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32152,32152,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
English Language Requirement and Educational Inequality: Evidence from 16 Million College Applicants in China,"Hongbin Li, Lingsheng Meng, Kai Mu, Shaoda Wang","This paper studies the unintended effect of English language requirement on educational inequality by investigating how the staggered rollout of English listening tests in China’s high-stakes National College Entrance Exam (NCEE) affected the rural-urban gap in college access. Leveraging administrative data covering the universe of NCEE participants between 1999 and 2003, we find that the introduction of English listening tests significantly lowered rural students’ exam score percentile ranks relative to their urban counterparts, resulting in a 30% increase in the rural-urban gap in college access. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, as a result of this policy change, more than 54,000 rural students lost college seats to their urban peers between 1999 and 2003, and another 11,000 rural students who elite colleges could have admitted ended up in non-elite colleges, causing them significant future income losses.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32162,32162,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
How Do Voters Respond to Welfare Vis-a-Vis Public Good Programs? Theory and Evidence of Political Clientelism,"Pranab Bardhan, Sandip Mitra, Dilip Mookherjee, Anusha Nath","Using rural household survey data from West Bengal, we find that voters respond positively to excludable government welfare benefits but not to local public good  programs, while reporting having benefited from both. Consistent with these voting patterns, shocks to electoral competition induced by exogenous redistricting of villages resulted in upper-tier governments manipulating allocations across local governments only for excludable benefit programs. Using a hierarchical budgeting model, we argue these results provide credible evidence of the presence of clientelism rather than programmatic politics.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32158,32158,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
The Essential Role of Altruism in Medical Decision Making,"Paul Gertler, Ada Kwan","Patients rely on medical care providers to act in their best interests because providers understand disease pathology and appropriate treatment much better than patients. Providers, however, not only give advice (diagnose) but also deliver (sell) treatments based on that advice. This creates a moral hazard dilemma where provider financial interests can diverge from patient interests, especially when providers are motivated more by profits than by altruism. We investigate how profit motivated versus altruistic preferences influence medical care decision making in the context of malaria in Kenya. We measured the appropriateness of care using data from an audit study that employed standardized patients (SP) who were trained to present as real patients the identical clinical case scenario to providers. The SPs were confirmed to be malaria negative before and after field work with a very reliable and sensitive blood test at a high-quality laboratory. We measured provider preferences using a lab in the field, real stakes, modified version of the dictator game. We find that more profit-motivated providers report higher rates of false-positive malaria test results than do more altruistic providers. Specifically, purely profit motivated providers report 30 percentage points more positives than providers who are altruistically motivated, and providers likely knew that the positive results that they reported to their patients were false. We also find that more profit motivated providers sold more unnecessary antimalarial drugs than did more altruistic providers. Based on mediation analysis, more profit-oriented providers sold more drugs not only because they knowingly reported more false positives, but also because they promoted drugs sales more conditional on a positive test result. Thus, profit motivated providers seem to have misrepresented test results to sell more unnecessary malaria-related drugs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32151,32151,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
Declining Clientelism of Welfare Benefits? Targeting and Political Competition based Evidence from an Indian state,"Pushkar Maitra, Sandip Mitra, Dilip Mookherjee, Sujata Visaria","It has been argued that since 2014, under the BJP-led central government, welfare benefits in India have become better targeted and less prone to clientelistic control by state and local governments. Arguably this has helped to increase the vote share of the BJP vis-a-vis regional parties. We test these hypotheses using longitudinal data from 3500 rural households in the state of West Bengal. We fail to find evidence that the new “central” programs introduced after 2014 were better targeted than traditional “state” programs, or that the targeting of state programs improved after 2014. Households receiving the new “central” benefits introduced since 2014 were more likely to switch their political support to the BJP. However, changes in the scale, composition or targeting of these programs, in clientelistic effectiveness of traditional state programs or in household incomes, fail to account for the large observed increase in the voters' support for the BJP. Non-Hindus, especially recent immigrant non-Hindus, were much less likely to switch support to the BJP, even after controlling for benefits received and changes in household incomes. Our results suggest that ideology and identity politics were more important factors explaining the rising popularity of the BJP.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32157,32157,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
"Labor Migration, Capital Accumulation, and the Structure of Rural Labor Markets","Taryn Dinkelman, Grace Kumchulesi, Martine Mariotti","Between 1967 and 1974, a bilateral treaty increased circular labor migration from Malawi to South Africa by 200%, bringing over 53 million USD in earnings into origin communities. A deadly migrant worker plane crash in 1974 ended these flows and led to migrant repatriation. We study how this shock affected local labor markets. In regions receiving more migrant capital after the crash, workers, particularly women, shifted from farming into non-farm work over thirty years. Investments in non-farm physical and human capital contribute to these sectoral changes. This natural experiment shows that temporary capital inflows can permanently reshape rural labor markets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32144,32144,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
A Cognitive Foundation for Perceiving Uncertainty,"J. Aislinn Bohren, Josh Hascher, Alex Imas, Michael Ungeheuer, Martin Weber","We propose a framework where perceptions of uncertainty are driven by the interaction between cognitive constraints and the way that people learn about it—whether information is presented sequentially or simultaneously. People can learn about uncertainty by observing the distribution of outcomes all at once (e.g., seeing a stock return distribution) or sampling outcomes from the relevant distribution sequentially (e.g., experiencing a series of stock returns). Limited attention leads to the overweighting of unlikely but salient events—the dominant force when learning from simultaneous information—whereas imperfect recall leads to the underweighting of such events—the dominant force when learning sequentially. A series of studies show that, when learning from simultaneous information, people are overoptimistic about and are attracted to assets that mostly underperform, but sporadically exhibit large outperformance. However, they overwhelmingly select more consistently outperforming assets when learning the same information sequentially, and this is reflected in beliefs. The entire 40-percentage point preference reversal appears to be driven by limited attention and memory; manipulating these factors completely eliminates the effect of the learning environment on choices and beliefs, and can even reverse it.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32149,32149,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
Understanding the Demand-Side of an Illegal Market: Prohibition of Menthol Cigarettes,"Donald S. Kenkel, Alan D. Mathios, Grace N. Phillips, Revathy Suryanarayana, Hua Wang, Sen Zeng","The Food and Drug Administration has proposed to prohibit menthol cigarettes, which are smoked by almost 19 million people in the U.S.  Illegal markets for menthol cigarettes could not only blunt the prohibition’s intended consequence to reduce smoking but could also lead to unintended consequences. We use data from a discrete choice experiment to estimate a mixed logit model which predicts that the prohibition of menthol cigarettes would substantially increase the fraction of menthol smokers who attempt to quit. However, our model also predicts a substantial potential consumer demand for illegal menthol cigarettes. Depending on the impact of illegality on product prices, our model predicts the potential demand-side of an illegal market for menthol cigarettes could be 59-92 percent the size of the status quo market if menthol e-cigarettes are legal, and 69-100 percent the size of the status quo market if menthol e-cigarettes are also illegal. Our mixed logit model estimated in willingness to pay space implies that the mean WTP to avoid an illegal retail market is equivalent to a tax of $8.44 per pack. In our partial cost-benefit analysis, the opportunity costs of prohibition exceed the value of the reduction in mortality risks from secondhand smoke by $15.4 billion annually.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32148,32148,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
The Long-term Effects of Inflation on Inflation Expectations,"Fabio Braggion, Felix von Meyerinck, Nic Schaub, Michael Weber","We study the long-term effects of inflation surges on inflation expectations. German households living in areas with higher local inflation during the hyperinflation of the 1920s expect higher inflation today, after partialling out determinants of historical inflation and current inflation expectations . Our evidence points towards transmission of inflation experiences from parents to children and through collective memory. Differential historical inflation also modulates the updating of expectations to current inflation, the response to economic policies affecting inflation, and financial decisions. We obtain similar results for Polish households residing in formerly German areas. Overall, our findings are consistent with inflationary shocks having a long-lasting impact on attitudes towards inflation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32160,32160,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
Gender Differences in Negotiations and Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from an Information Intervention with College Students,"Patricia Cortés, Jacob French, Jessica Pan, Basit Zafar","We assess the role of information gaps in understanding gender differences in negotiation behavior by conducting a randomized information experiment on the 2018 to 2020 graduating cohorts of undergraduate business majors from Boston University. Prior to starting their job search, treated students were provided with objective information about the gender gap in negotiation among their peers along with the earnings changes conditional on negotiating. We find sizable immediate effects on negotiation intentions that persist to actual negotiation behavior, particularly for men. While the treatment affects women's negotiation behavior through belief-updating, the effects on men's behavior are primarily through increased salience of the information. Further, we find some evidence that gender-specific treatment spillovers likely contribute to the smaller average treatment effects on behavior for women. Overall, our findings suggest that such information interventions can help to nudge women who have potentially large financial returns to negotiation to realize these gains.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32154,32154,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
How Managers Can Use Purchaser Performance Information to Improve Procurement Efficiency,"Pablo A. Celhay, Paul Gertler, Marcelo Olivares, Raimundo Undurraga","We examine the effect of performance monitoring in public procurement through the lens of organizational culture in a principal-agent model where the manager (principal) and buyers (agents) may have different beliefs about how much the government values efficiency. We show that the effect of performance information not only increases efficiency but is greater when the buyer’s belief is stronger than the manager’s belief. We leverage a new e-procurement system in Chile to test these ideas by randomizing monthly reports on the purchasing performance of buyers and further whether the individual performance reports were disclosed to managers. We find that the reports generated sizable reductions in overspending — with savings reaching a 15% reduction or 0.1% of GDP — but only when individual performance was observable to managers. This is consistent with extrinsic motivation rather than intrinsic motivation driving buyer behavior. Consistent with the theoretical model, we also find that the gain in efficiency is concentrated in procurement units where buyer belief that the government cares about efficiency is stronger than manager belief. Our results highlight the key role played by organizational culture in mediating the impact of purchasing performance information on preventing the misuse of public resources.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32141,32141,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024

Information-Based Pricing in Specialized Lending,"Kristian Blickle, Zhiguo He, Jing Huang, Cecilia Parlatore","We study specialized lending in a credit market competition model with private information. Two banks, equipped with similar data processing systems, possess “general” signals regarding the borrower's quality. However, the specialized bank gains an additional advantage through further interactions with the borrower, allowing it to access “specialized” signals. In equilibrium, both lenders use general signals to screen loan applications, and the specialized lender prices the loan based on its specialized signal conditional on making a loan. This private-information-based pricing helps deliver the empirical regularity that loans made by specialized lenders have lower rates (i.e., lower winning bids) and better ex-post performance (i.e., lower non-performing loans). We show the robustness of our equilibrium characterization under a generalized information structure, endogenize the specialized lending through information acquisition, and discuss its various economic implications.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32155,32155,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
Trade War and Peace: U.S.-China Trade and Tariff Risk from 2015–2050,"George A. Alessandria, Shafaat Y. Khan, Armen Khederlarian, Kim J. Ruhl, Joseph B.

We find (i) there was no increase in the likelihood of a trade war before 2018; (ii) the trade war was initially expected to end quickly, but its expected duration grew substantially after 2020; and (iii) the trade war reduced the likelihood that China would face Non-Normal Trade Relations tariffs in the future. Our findings imply that the expected mean future U.S. tariff on China rose more under President Biden than under President Trump.

Invoice Currency Choice in Intra-Firm Trade: A Transaction-Level Analysis of Japanese Automobile Exports,"Taiyo Yoshimi, Uraku Yoshimoto, Kiyotaka Sato, Takatoshi Ito, Junko Shimizu, Yushi Yoshida","This study empirically investigates how the invoice currency choice differs between intra-firm and arm’s-length exports. We also examine whether other firm- and product-level characteristics affect the choice of invoice currency. This study is the first to be granted access to highly disaggregated transaction-level trade data for Japan. Focusing on Japanese automobile exports to France, we demonstrate that the importer’s currency tends to be chosen in intra-firm export invoicing based on a panel logit estimation. Our empirical findings remain robust when different types of intra-firm export variables and other conventional explanatory variables are introduced, such as firm and product market share, exchange rate volatility, euro-invoiced imports, labor productivity, and research and development intensity. Given growing intra-firm trade and expanding global value chains, Japanese parent firms tend to invoice in the importers’ currency, assuming the foreign exchange risk that arises from intra-firm trade.

"Climate Change, Population Growth, and Population Pressure","J. Vernon Henderson, Bo Yeon Jang, Adam Storeygard, David N.

We apply it to estimate and compare the projected effects of climate change and population growth over the course of the 21st century, by country and globally. We find that standard population growth projections imply larger reductions in income than even the most extreme widely-adopted climate change scenario (RCP8.5). Climate and population impacts are correlated across countries: climate change and population growth will have their most damaging effects in similar places. Relative to previous work on macro climate impacts, our approach has the advantages of being disciplined by a simple macro growth model that allows for adaptation and of assessing impacts via a large set of climate moments, not just annual average temperature and precipitation.  Further, our estimated effects of climate are by construction independent of country-level factors such as institutions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32145,32145,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024
Taxing Top Wealth: Migration Responses and their Aggregate Economic Implications,"Katrine Jakobsen, Henrik Kleven, Jonas Kolsrud, Camille Landais, Mathilde Muñoz","Using administrative data on wealth, firm ownership structure, and migration in Sweden and Denmark, we document international migration patterns among the very wealthy, their impact on the economy, and how they respond to wealth taxation. We show that more than 20% of taxpayers liable to pay wealth tax are business-owners, and that the employment, investments, and value-added of these businesses are negatively affected when their owner migrates out of the country. Exploiting three large reforms, we then isolate the causal effect of wealth taxation on the international location choices of the wealthy. We find significant effects on out-migration flows from increases in the effective wealth tax. But, we also document that the overall level of these migration flows is remarkably small, with annual net-migration rates below .01%. As a result, we find that the aggregate economic effects of tax-induced migration are modest in Scandinavia: a one percentage point increase in the average wealth tax rate on the top 2% decreases the stock of wealthy taxpayers by at most 2% in the long run, and lead to a reduction of at most .03% in aggregate employment and at most .1% in aggregate value- added. Hence, our results suggest that trickle-down effects of tax-induced migration by the wealthy do exist, but that they are quantitatively small.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32153,32153,Feb-24,NBER,2/19/2024

Leveraging administrative data covering the universe of NCEE participants between 1999 and 2003, we find that the introduction of English listening tests significantly lowered rural students’ exam score percentile ranks relative to their urban counterparts, resulting in a 30% increase in the rural-urban gap in college access. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, as a result of this policy change, more than 54,000 rural students lost college seats to their urban peers between 1999 and 2003, and another 11,000 rural students who elite colleges could have admitted ended up in non-elite colleges, causing them significant future income losses.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/english-language-requirement-and-educational-inequality-evidence-from-16-million-college-applicants-in-china/,2024-20-1,"Feb 19, 2024",BFI,02/22/2024

Mind Your Language: Market Responses to Central Bank Speeches,"Maximilian Ahrens, Deniz Erdemlioglu, Michael McMahon, Christopher J. Neely, and Xyie Yang","Researchers have carefully studied post-meeting central bank communication and have found that it often moves markets, but they have paid less attention to the more frequent central bankers’ speeches. We create a novel dataset of US Federal Reserve speeches and develop supervised multimodal natural language processing methods to identify how monetary policy news affect financial volatility and tail risk through implied changes in forecasts of GDP, inflation, and unemployment. We find that news in central bankers’ speeches can help explain volatility and tail risk in both equity and bond markets. Our results challenge the conventional view that central bank communication primarily resolves uncertainty and indicate that markets attend to speech signals more closely during abnormal GDP and inflation regimes. Our analysis also reveals that the views of Fed members (i.e., hawkish versus dovish) tend to play a marginal role in terms of the strength of the speech signals. Looking at the speeches by the Fed Chair, we find that the Chair signals produce a larger tail risk compared to non-Chair signals, and the estimated magnitude of the market responses depends on the position of the officials (i.e., the Fed Chair or other Fed member).",https://research.stlouisfed.org//wp/more/2023-013,2023-013B,February 2024,FED-STLOUIS,02/23/2024
Optimal Urban Transportation Policy: Evidence from Chicago,"Milena Almagro, Felipe Barbieri, Juan Camilo Castillo, Nathaniel Hickok, Tobias Salz","We characterize optimal urban transportation policies in the presence of congestion and environmental externalities and evaluate their welfare and distributional effects. We present a framework of a municipal government that implements different transportation equilibria through its choice of public transit policies, prices and frequencies, as well as road pricing. The government faces a budget constraint that introduces monopoly-like distortions. We apply this framework to Chicago, for which we construct a new dataset that comprehensively captures transportation choices. We ﬁnd that road pricing alone leads to large welfare gains by reducing externalities, but at the expense of consumers (travelers), whose surplus falls even if road pricing revenues are fully rebated. The largest losses are borne by middle income consumers, who are most reliant on cars. We ﬁnd that the optimal price of public transit is close to zero and goes along with a reduction in the frequency of buses and an increase in the frequency of trains. Combining these transit policies with road pricing eliminates budget constraints. This allows the government to implement higher transit frequencies and even lower prices, in which case consumer surplus increases after rebates.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/optimal-urban-transportation-policy-evidence-from-chicago/,2024-22,"Feb 22, 2024",BFI,02/23/2024

Determinants of Zombie Banks in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies,"Torsten Wezel, Hannah Sheldon, Zhengwei Fu","While deeply undercapitalized banks have been shown to misallocate credit to weak firms, the drivers of such zombie banks are less researched, particularly across countries. To furnish empirical evidence, we compile a dataset of undercapitalized banks from emerging markets and developing economies. We classify zombie banks as those not receiving remedial treatment by owners or regulators or, alternatively, remaining chronically undercapitalized. Using logit regressions, we find that country-specific factors are more influential for zombie status than bank characteristics, alhough some become significant when disaggreating by region.

A New Measure of Central Bank Independence,"Tobias Adrian, Ashraf Khan, Lev Menand","This paper constructs a new index for measuring de jure central bank independence, the first entirely new index in three decades. The index draws on a comprehensive dataset from the IMF’s Central Bank Legislation Database (CBLD) and Monetary Operations and Instruments Database (MOID) and weightings derived from a survey of 87 respondents, mostly consisting of central bank governors and general counsels. It improves upon existing indices including the Cukierman, Webb, and Neyapti (CWN) index, which has been the de facto standard for measuring central bank independence since 1992, as well as recent extensions by Garriga (2016) and Romelli (2022). For example, it includes areas absent from the CWN index, such as board composition, financial independence, and budgetary independence. It treats dimensions such as the status of the chief executive as composite metrics to prevent overstating the independence of statutory schemes. It distills ten key metrics, simplifying current frameworks that now include upwards of forty distinct variables. And it replaces the subjective weighting systems relied on in the existing literature with an empirically grounded alternative. This paper presents the key features of the new index; a companion, forthcoming paper will provide detailed findings by country/region, income level, and exchange rate regime.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/02/23/A-New-Measure-of-Central-Bank-Independence-545270,WPIEA2024035,"Fri, 23 Feb 2024 ",IMF,02/24/2024
The Secular Decline of Bank Balance Sheet Lending,"Greg Buchak, Gregor Matvos, Tomasz Piskorski, Amit Seru","The traditional model of bank-led financial intermediation, where banks issue demandable deposits to savers and make informationally sensitive loans to borrowers, has seen a dramatic decline since 1970s. Instead, private credit is increasingly intermediated through arms-length transactions, such as securitization. This paper documents these trends, explores their causes, and discusses their implications for the financial system and regulation. We document that the balance sheet share of overall private lending has declined from 60% in 1970 to 35% in 2023, while the deposit share of savings has declined from 22% to 13%. Additionally, the share of loans as a percentage of bank assets has fallen from 70% to 55%. We develop a structural model to explore whether technological improvements in securitization, shifts in saver preferences away from deposits, and changes in implicit subsidies and costs of bank activities can explain these shifts. Declines in securitization cost account for changes in aggregate lending quantities. Savers, rather than borrowers, are the main drivers of bank balance sheet size, Implicit banks’ costs and subsidies explain shifting bank balance sheet composition. Together, these forces explain the fall in the overall share of informationally sensitive bank lending in credit intermediation. We conclude by examining how these shifts impact the financial sector’s sensitivity to macroprudential regulation. While raising capital requirements or liquidity requirements decreases lending in both early (1960s) and recent (2020’s) scenarios, the effect is less pronounced in the later period due to the reduced role of bank balance sheets in credit intermediation. The substitution of bank balance sheet loans with debt securities in response to these policies explains why we observe only a fairly modest decline in aggregate lending despite a large contraction of bank balance sheet lending. Overall, we find that the intermediation sector has undergone significant transformation, with implications for macroprudential policy and financial regulation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32176,32176,February 2024,NBER,02/26/2024
"Heterogeneity, Uncertainty and Learning: Semiparametric Identification and Estimation","Jackson Bunting, Paul Diegert, Arnaud Maurel","We provide semiparametric identification results for a broad class of learning models in which continuous outcomes depend on three types of unobservables: i) known heterogeneity, ii) initially unknown heterogeneity that may be revealed over time, and iii) transitory uncertainty. We consider a common environment where the researcher only has access to a short panel on choices and realized outcomes. We establish identification of the outcome equation parameters and the distribution of the three types of unobservables, under the standard assumption that unknown heterogeneity and uncertainty are normally distributed. We also show that, absent known heterogeneity, the model is identified without making any distributional assumption. We then derive the asymptotic properties of a sieve MLE estimator for the model parameters, and devise a tractable profile likelihood based estimation procedure. Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that our estimator exhibits good finite-sample properties.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32164,32164,February 2024,NBER,02/26/2024

Climate Policy Reform Options in 2025,"John Bistline, Kimberly A. Clausing, Neil Mehrotra, James H. Stock, Catherine Wolfram","With the expiration of many tax cuts and unmet climate targets, 2025 could be a crucial year for climate policy in the United States. Using an integrated model of energy supply and demand, this paper aims to assess climate policies that the U.S. federal government may consider in 2025 and to evaluate emissions reductions, fiscal costs and revenues, and household energy expenditures across a range of policy scenarios. Model results suggest that the emissions reductions of the Inflation Reduction Act are significantly augmented under scenarios that add a modest carbon fee or, to a lesser extent, that implement a clean electricity standard in the power sector. Second, net fiscal costs can be substantially reduced in scenarios that include a carbon fee, especially if fossil fuel exports are taxed. Third, expanding the IRA tax credits yields modest additional emissions reductions with higher fiscal costs. Finally, although none of the policy combinations across these scenarios achieve the U.S. target of a 50-52% economy-wide emissions reduction by 2030 from 2005 levels, the carbon fee and clean electricity standard scenarios achieve these levels between 2030 and 2035.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32168,32168,February 2024,NBER,02/26/2024
Diversity and Discrimination in the Classroom,"Dan Anderberg, Gordon B. Dahl, Cristina Felfe, Helmut Rainer, Thomas Siedler","What makes diversity unifying in some settings but divisive in others?  We examine how the mixing of ethnic groups in German schools affects intergroup cooperation and trust. We leverage the quasi-random assignment of students to classrooms within schools to obtain variation in the type of diversity that prevails in a peer group. We combine this with a large-scale, incentivized lab-in-field-experiment based on the investment game, allowing us to assess the in-group bias of native German students in their interactions with fellow natives (in-group) versus immigrants (out-group). We find in-group bias peaks in culturally polarized classrooms, where the native and immigrant groups are both large, but have different religious or language backgrounds.  In contrast, in classrooms characterized by non-cultural polarization, fractionalization, or a native supermajority, there are significantly lower levels of own-group favoritism. In terms of mechanisms, we find empirical evidence that culturally polarized classrooms foster negative stereotypes about immigrants' trustworthiness and amplify taste-based discrimination, both of which are costly and lead to lower payouts. In contrast, accurate statistical discrimination is ruled out by design in our experiment. These findings suggest that extra efforts are needed to counteract low levels of inclusivity and trust in culturally polarized environments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32177,32177,February 2024,NBER,02/26/2024
From Dominant to Producer Currency Pricing: Dynamics of Chilean Exports,"José De Gregorio, Pablo García, Emiliano E.

We use granular export data for Chile and study how the effects of ER movements vary over time with the currency of invoicing and the destination of exports. For prices, we find that the short-run effects of bilateral ER movements vanish when controlling for U.S. dollar ER, which supports dominant currency pricing. However, over longer horizons a more significant role is played by bilateral ER movements, in line with the predictions of producer currency pricing. These dynamics do not depend on the invoicing currency. The results we find for quantities support the view that bilateral exchange rate movements contribute to macroeconomic adjustment through export volumes over the medium term.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32175,32175,February 2024,NBER,02/26/2024
The Cost of Money is Part of the Cost of Living: New Evidence on the Consumer Sentiment Anomaly,"Marijn A. Bolhuis, Judd N. L. Cramer, Karl Oskar Schulz, Lawrence H. Summers","Unemployment is low and inflation is falling, but consumer sentiment remains depressed. This has confounded economists, who historically rely on these two variables to gauge how consumers feel about the economy. We propose that borrowing costs, which have grown at rates they had not reached in decades, do much to explain this gap. The cost of money is not currently included in traditional price indexes, indicating a disconnect between the measures favored by economists and the effective costs borne by consumers. We show that the lows in US consumer sentiment that cannot be explained by unemployment and official inflation are strongly correlated with borrowing costs and consumer credit supply. Concerns over borrowing costs, which have historically tracked the cost of money, are at their highest levels since the Volcker-era. We then develop alternative measures of inflation that include borrowing costs and can account for almost three quarters of the gap in US consumer sentiment in 2023. Global evidence shows that consumer sentiment gaps across countries are also strongly correlated with changes in interest rates. Proposed U.S.-specific factors do not find much supportive evidence abroad.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32163,32163,February 2024,NBER,02/26/2024

Higher household debt levels and growth are associated with significantly slower GDP growth in more developed EMEs but not in less developed EMEs and FMEs. We also examine the relationship between US dollar cycles, sectoral debt levels and growth, and economic activity. Among developed EMEs, higher expected household debt growth magnifies the impact of US dollar fluctuations on economic activity, with significant but less persistent effects on consumption and more persistent effects on investment. Our empirical findings highlight the important role of household debt dynamics in relatively developed EMEs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32174,32174,February 2024,NBER,02/26/2024
Competitive Job Seekers: When Sharing Less Leaves Firms at a Loss,"Gaurav Chiplunkar, Erin M. Kelley, Gregory V. Lane","We study how job-seekers share information about jobs within their social network, and its implications for firms. We randomly increase the amount of competition for a job and find that job-seekers are: (i) less likely to share information about the job with their peers; and (ii) choose to selectively share it with fewer higher ability peers. This lowers the quality of applicants received by firms, subsequent hires made, and performance on the job — suggesting that firms who rely on social networks to disseminate job information may see lower quality applicants than expected for their most competitive positions. While randomly offering higher wages attracts better talent, it is not able to fully overcome these strategic disincentives in information sharing",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32171,32171,February 2024,NBER,02/26/2024

We embed the product-market friction in a standard neoclassical model and estimate it using Bayesian techniques.

At high unemployment rates, an increase in demand reduces unemployment without creating strong inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, supply shocks have a muted effect.

Do Information Frictions and Corruption Perceptions Kill Competition? A Field Experiment On Public Procurement in Uganda,"Emanuele Colonnelli, Francesco Loiacono, Edwin Muhumuza, Edoardo Teso","We study whether information frictions and corruption perceptions deter firms from doing business with the government. We conduct two nationwide randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in collaboration with the national public procurement supervisory and anti-corruption agency in Uganda. The first RCT aims to increase firms’ information on available procurement opportunities, which is limited due to the lack of a centralized e- procurement system. We provide firms with direct and timely access to information about government tenders over a two-year period. The second RCT focuses on firms’ perceptions about the integrity of public entities, which we experimentally show are key drivers of firms’ participation in procurement. We provide firms with access to structured information on other firms’ perceptions and on anti-corruption audits. We find that increasing information on available procurement opportunities alone does not increase firm participation in public procurement. However, changing firms’ perceptions about the integrity of public entities increases firms’ total number of bids and total government contracts won. Based on our findings, our partner agency implemented several measures to further restore firms’ trust in public entities. Overall, our findings point to the limits of transparency reforms that aim to increase competition in public procurement without accounting for firms’ perceptions about government corruption and inefficiency.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w32170,32170,February 2024,NBER,02/26/2024

"Job Loss, Credit Card Loans, and the College-persistence Decision of US Working Students",Pinghui Wu and Lucy McMillan,"This study assesses the impact of involuntary job loss on college persistence by leveraging different job-loss timings relative to a student’s college enrollment decision. We find that job loss increases the probability that a working college student leaves college before attaining a degree, but access to short-term credit through credit card loans buffers this liquidity effect.

It uses the 2018 Merrimack Valley natural gas explosions as a quasi-random natural experiment and shows that the explosions had a temporary negative effect on debt balances, credit limits, and the number of delinquencies, and did not affect credit scores. The decreases in debt balances and credit limits were likely driven by a decline in credit demand when the affected individuals faced severe life disruption, great uncertainty, and negative financial shocks associated with the disaster.

The Channels of International Comovement,Omar Barbiero,"How does exposure to international markets affect returns and cash flow comovements? Foreign bond owners, lenders, affiliates, investors, customers, and suppliers all transmit country shocks to companies. Most multinationals have many of these exposures simultaneously within the same foreign market. Returns and cash flows of two companies comove when exposed to the same country through the same channel. Within-country exposure through different channels is generally associated with lower comovement, in line with an operational hedging strategy. This evidence can help reconcile how, on average, increased market integration does not lead to increased comovement.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/the-channels-of-international-comovement,23-16,"November 27, 2023",FED-BOSTON,02/26/2024
Informal Work and Official Employment Statistics: What’s Missing?,Anat Bracha and Mary A. Burke,"Using eight consecutive waves of the Survey of Informal Work Participation (SIWP) spanning 2015 through 2022, we investigate informal “gig” work participation in the United States—broadly defined to include online and offline activities—and its implications for the measurement of employment. Our results suggest that employment rates among US household heads were consistently understated in the Current Population Survey (CPS). Under conservative estimates, we find that the employment-to-population ratio would have been 0.25 to 1.1 percentage points higher over the 2015–2022 period and as much as 5.1 percentage points higher under more generous estimates. Along the intensive margin, we find evidence that a significant number of informal work hours are missing from official employment surveys, partly because employed individuals do not fully report their informal hours.  Comparing informal workers who are classified as employed by the CPS with those who are arguably misclassified as nonemployed, we find that the latter are, on average, older, less educated, and less likely to cite income as a motivation for gig work, and an elevated share are disabled. The data also indicate that certain types of income-earning activities, such as renting and selling, are less likely to be perceived as “work.”  These results suggest ways to improve official surveys to better capture those employed in gig work and obtain a fuller picture of the labor market.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/informal-work-and-official-employment-statistics-whats-missing.aspx,23-15,"November 21, 2023",FED-BOSTON,02/26/2024
"Decomposing Lifetime-earnings Differences between White, Black, and Hispanic Families","Hope Bodenschatz, Gerald E. Daniels Jr., and Jeffrey P. Thompson","This paper explores disparities between White, Black, and Hispanic families using a measure of lifetime earnings developed by Jacobs et al. (2022) for the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Lifetime earnings are a particularly important measure of well-being, with relevance for wealth accumulation among other economic and social outcomes, but they are under-studied in the context of racial disparities. We describe how the different components of lifetime earnings—including annual earnings of workers, number of working household members, and number of years of employment during the working life—vary by race. We then decompose the differences in lifetime earnings using the recentered influence function and show that human capital-related variables, including educational attainment and years of full-time employment, account for most of the observed differences in lifetime earnings between White, Black, and Hispanic families. We also explore the contribution of business ownership to explained disparities in lifetime earnings and find that it is significant and that business ownership’s explanatory power increases at the top of the lifetime-earnings distribution.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/decomposing-lifetime-earnings-differences-between-white-black-and-hispanic-families,23-14,"November 14, 2023",FED-BOSTON,02/26/2024
The Aggregate Effects of Sectoral Shocks in an Open Economy,"Philippe Andrade, Martin Arazi, and Viacheslav Sheremirov","We study the aggregate effects of sectoral productivity shocks in a multisectoral New Keynesian open-economy model that allows for asymmetric input-output linkages, both within and between countries, as well as for heterogeneity in sectoral Calvo-type price stickiness. Asymmetries in the international production network play a key role in the model’s ability to produce large domestic effects of foreign sectoral supply shocks and large differential effects of domestic shocks and global shocks. Larger trade openness and substitutability between domestic inputs and foreign inputs can also significantly amplify the effects of foreign and global sectoral shocks on domestic aggregates. In comparison, sectoral heterogeneity in price stickiness does not materially amplify the domestic responses to productivity shocks that originate abroad.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/the-aggregate-effects-of-sectoral-shocks-in-an-open-economy.aspx,23-13,"October 20, 2023",FED-BOSTON,02/26/2024
Household Liquidity and Macroeconomic Stabilization: Evidence from Mortgage Forbearance,Sean Chanwook Lee and Omeed Maghzian,"We estimate the impact of household liquidity provision on macroeconomic stabilization using the 2020 CARES Act mortgage forbearance program. We leverage intermediation frictions in forbearance induced by mortgage servicers to identify the effect of reducing short-term payments with little change in long-term debt obligations on local labor market outcomes. Following statewide business reopenings, a 1 percentage point increase in the share of mortgages in forbearance leads to a 30 basis point increase in monthly employment growth in nontradable industries. In a model incorporating geographical heterogeneity in intermediation frictions, these responses imply a household-level marginal propensity to consume out of increased liquidity that aligns with existing estimates for direct fiscal transfers. The implied debt-financed fiscal multiplier effects of forbearance are sizable but depend on the repayment terms of deferred payments and the monetary policy stance.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/household-liquidity-and-macroeconomic-stabilization-evidence-from-mortgage-forbearance,23-12,"November 14, 2023",FED-BOSTON,02/26/2024

Lease Expirations and CRE Property Performance,David Glancy and J. Christina Wang,"This study analyzes how lease expirations affect the performance of commercial real estate (CRE) properties and how these patterns changed during the COVID-19 crisis. Even before the pandemic, lease expirations were associated with a notable increase in the downside risk to a property’s occupancy or income, particularly in weaker property markets. These risks became more pronounced during the pandemic, driven mostly by office properties. During the pandemic, the adverse effect of lease expirations on office occupancy increased more than 50 percent overall, and it doubled for offices in central business districts (CBDs). This amplified effect of office lease expirations serves as a harbinger of further deterioration as leases continue to roll over in coming years, especially among CBD offices. Across lender groups, nonbank and large bank lenders are more exposed than regional and community banks to office loans in those distressed CBDs. This pattern somewhat alleviates the concern that CRE portfolio credit risk will exacerbate the headwinds faced by this latter group of banks.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/lease-expirations-and-cre-property-performance,23-10,"September 21, 2023",FED-BOSTON,02/26/2024
Cost-Price Relationships in a Concentrated Economy,"Falk Bräuning, José L. Fillat, and Gustavo Joaquim","We use local projections with granular instrumental variables to estimate the aggregate pass-through of costs into prices and how it is affected by industry concentration. On average, we find, prices increase above trend growth for three quarters after an exogenous cost shock, and the price increase is accompanied by a decline in output. The estimated pass-through of the shock into prices one quarter ahead is 0.7. The price response to shocks becomes about 27 percent larger when there is an increase in concentration similar to the one observed over the last 20 years. This differential effect depending on concentration is primarily driven by a larger pass-through of positive shocks that increase costs. Consistent with a market power channel, margins decrease less in more concentrated industries after cost increases. Within industries, margins of industry leaders are not squeezed in response to positive cost shocks, unlike those of followers, while negative shocks increase margins for all firms. Our findings shed light on the post-COVID inflationary pressures and the linkages between inflation dynamics and rising market concentration.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/cost-price-relationships-in-a-concentrated-economy,23-9,"August 31, 2023",FED-BOSTON,02/26/2024
Risk Management and Derivatives Losses,"Gabriel  Levin-Konigsberg, Hillary Stein, Vicente  García Averell, and Calixto  López Castañon","Even though financial risk management has the ability to generate value, the use of financial derivatives among nonfinancial corporations remains limited. We identify a channel that contributes to this limited use: the decoupling of derivatives losses and operational gains. Specifically, firms ex post consider their operational profits separately from their derivatives profits. We explore this phenomenon among firms in Mexico. We use the universe of US dollar-Mexican peso currency derivatives transactions in Mexico along with customs data to construct a unique data set on operational exchange rate exposure and financial hedging. We find that contrary to a rational and frictionless benchmark, performance in previous derivatives transactions predicts future derivatives use. Using a regression kink design to measure the impact of decoupling on risk management, we find that when losses from previous transactions increase 1 percentage point, firms become 4.24 percentage points less likely to take out a new derivatives position within 90 days.

We find that the top 1 percent of urban counties by population fully account for the significant effect of the delay on county-level employment. The strong correlation between worse loan delay and slower employment growth in these counties is due to a factor commonly omitted from analyses: The nature of business and the high rate of human interactions in major urban centers render these areas exceptionally and persistently vulnerable to infectious diseases.

Sustainable Consumption and the Comprehensive Economic Well-Being of American Households,"Daniel H. Cooper, Barry Z. Cynamon, and Steven M. Fazzari","This paper develops a comprehensive measure of household economic well-being. The “sustainable consumption” concept accounts for income, assets, debt, transfer payments, and asset returns to estimate a consumption path that balances resources with expenditure over a household’s lifetime. Calculating sustainable consumption using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data demonstrates that it acts as an anchor for actual household spending. Results show that following a period of rapid growth from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s, sustainable consumption stagnated on average. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the decline in sustainable consumption exceeded the fall in actual consumption due in part to a decline in real asset returns. Decomposing sustainable consumption reveals the relative importance of different household resources in determining well-being and how these factors evolve over time—insights that would be missed when resources such as income or wealth are considered separately. Taxable income supports the majority of sustainable consumption; however, as a share of households’ lifetime resources, taxable income has decreased on average while the Social Security share has grown.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/sustainable-consumption-and-the-comprehensive-economic-well-being-of-american-households,23-5,"July 27, 2023",FED-BOSTON,02/26/2024

Although each personality trait is correlated with each of the financial outcomes we examine, they mostly become statistically insignificant when we control for demographics and income in regressions. Carrying credit card debt (revolving), however, is significantly affected by conscientiousness, openness, and agreeableness: Credit card adopters who are less conscientious, more open to experiences, or more agreeable are significantly more likely to revolve credit card debt.

To What Degree and through Which Channel Do Central Banks Other Than the Federal Reserve Cause Spillovers?,Christopher D. Cotton,"Spillovers play a crucial role in driving monetary policy around the world. The literature focuses predominantly
on spillovers from the Federal Reserve. Less attention has been paid to spillovers from other central banks. I measure the degree to which 20 central banks cause spillovers. I show that central banks in medium- to high-income countries cause spillovers to medium- to long-term interest rates in similar countries through a bond-pricing channel. These effects are narrower than spillovers from the Federal Reserve, which also affect emerging markets, short-term interest rates, and other assets. However, they are still pronounced. Fourteen central banks other than the Federal Reserve cause significant spillovers: the central banks of Australia, Canada, Czechia, the eurozone, Japan, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Consequently, the Federal Reserve causes only one-fifth of the spillovers to 10-year interest rates, and the United States is the recipient of large spillovers. My results imply that central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, are affected by greater spillovers than is commonly believed, and that non-Fed central banks cause spillovers through a bond-pricing channel.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/to-what-degree-and-through-which-channel-do-central-banks-cause-spillovers,23-3,"March 03, 2023",FED-BOSTON,02/26/2024

Dairy is New Zealand’s largest export category, making up almost 20 percent of exports. Specifically, whole milk powder accounts for 6 to 11 percent of total exports, and its price is determined in twice-monthly auctions. I use event studies to quantify the impact of surprise auction results on the New Zealand dollar on a high-frequency basis. I find that a 1 percent increase in whole milk powder prices has a modest, but nevertheless significant, effect on the nominal exchange rate that does not seem to be explained by interest rate movements. Rather, the effect seems to be driven by a combination of two channels: a financial flows channel and a fundamental channel.

Interest Rate Risk at US Credit Unions,"Grant Rosenberger, Peter Zimmerman","Rising interest rates have prompted concerns about losses on bank assets, especially following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023. In this working paper, we examine whether US credit unions could be subject to similar losses as banks and analyze how their regulatory capital would be affected. We estimate that after realizing losses from assets that have decreased in value and not yet been sold the overall net worth of the credit union industry would have fallen by 40 percent in 2023:Q1. Unrealized losses were most severe at the largest credit unions. Nonetheless, the bulk of deposits at credit unions were insured, suggesting limited risk of an SVB-style run. In addition, credit union deposit rates are relatively insensitive to market interest rates, providing credit unions with a hedge against a rising rate environment. Overall, credit unions’ balance sheet positions seemed to be more resilient to unrealized interest rate risk than banks’.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2403-interest-rate-risk-at-us-credit-unions,24-03,02.05.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,02/26/2024
The Effect of Component Disaggregation on Measures of the Median and Trimmed-Mean CPI,"Christian Garciga, Randal J. Verbrugge, Saeed Zaman","For decades, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC) has produced median and trimmed-mean consumer price index (CPI) measures. These have proven useful in various contexts, such as forecasting and understanding post-COVID inflation dynamics. Revisions to the FRBC methodology have historically involved increasing the level of disaggregation in the CPI components, which has improved accuracy. Thus, it may seem logical that further disaggregation would continue to enhance its accuracy. However, we theoretically demonstrate that this may not necessarily be the case. We then explore the empirical impact of further disaggregation along two dimensions: shelter and non-shelter components. We find that significantly increasing the disaggregation in the shelter indexes, when combined with only a slight increase in non-shelter disaggregation, improves the ability of the median and trimmed-mean CPI to track the medium-term trend in CPI inflation and marginally increases predictive power over future movements in CPI inflation. Finally, we examine the practical implications of our preferred degree of disaggregation. Our preferred measure of the median CPI suggests that trend inflation was lower pre-pandemic, while both our preferred median and trimmed-mean measures suggest a faster acceleration in trend inflation in 2021. We also find that higher disaggregation marginally weakens the Phillips curve relationship between median CPI inflation and the unemployment gap, though it remains statistically significant.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2402-effect-of-component-disaggregation,24-02,01.04.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,02/26/2024
The Effects of Interest Rate Increases on Consumers' Inflation Expectations: The Roles of Informedness and Compliance,"Edward S.

In a large-scale, multi-wave randomized controlled trial (RCT), we find weak evidence on average that communicating policy changes lowers consumers' medium-term inflation expectations. However, information differs systematically across demographic groups, in terms of ex ante informedness about monetary policy and ex post compliance with the information treatment. Monetary policy communications have a much stronger effect on people who had not previously heard news about monetary policy and who take sufficient time to read the treatment, implying scope to increase the impact of communications by targeting specific groups of the general public. Our findings show that, in an inflationary environment, consumers expect that raising interest rates will lower inflation. More generally, our results emphasize the importance of measuring both respondents' information sets and their compliance with treatment when using RCTs in empirical macroeconomics, to better understand the well-documented evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2401-consumers-inflation-expectations,24-01,01.03.2024,FED-CLEVELAND,02/26/2024
Can Supply Shocks Be Inflationary with a Flat Phillips Curve?,"Jean-Paul L’Huillier, Gregory Phelan","Not in standard models. With conventional pricing frictions, imposing a flat Phillips curve also imposes a price level that is rigid with respect to supply shocks. In the New Keynesian model, price markup shocks need to be several orders of magnitude bigger than other shocks in order to fit the data, leading to unreasonable assessments of the magnitude of the increase in costs during inflationary episodes. To account for the facts, we propose a strategic microfoundation of shock-dependent price stickiness: prices are sticky with respect to demand shocks but flexible with respect to supply shocks. This friction is demand-intrinsic, in line with narrative accounts for the imperfect adjustment of prices. Firms can credibly justify a price increase due to a rise in costs, whereas it is harder to do so when demand increases. Inflation from supply shocks is efficient and does not justify a monetary policy response.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2336-can-supply-shocks-be-inflationary-with-flat-phillips-curve,23-36,12.28.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,02/26/2024

A comprehensive historical evaluation of the accuracy of point and density forecasts from a range of models and approaches shows that a BVAR with stochastic volatility in aggregate core inflation, its three components, and wage growth is an effective tool for forecasting inflation's components as well as aggregate core inflation. Looking ahead, the model's baseline projection puts core inflation at 2.6 percent in 2026, well below its 2023 level but still elevated relative to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective. The probability that core inflation will return to 2 percent or less is much higher when conditioning on goods or non-housing services inflation slowing to pre-pandemic levels than when conditioning on these components remaining above the same thresholds. Scenario analysis indicates that slower wage growth will likely be associated with reduced inflation in all three components, especially goods and non-housing services, helping to return core inflation to near the 2 percent target by 2026.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2334-forecasting-core-inflation-and-its-components,23-34,12.20.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,02/26/2024

This correlation implies that monetary policy surprises provide information about the state of the economy, and at the same time, explains why the estimation of the information effect may be biased. We then develop a New Keynesian DSGE model under asymmetric information and calibrate model parameters to match macroeconomic dynamics in the US and forecasting accuracy in the Greenbook. Under our calibration, both the central bank and the private sector initially have noisy information.

To allow for nonlinearities in the predictive relationship we use quantile regression methods.

While professional forecasters are more accurate in the middle of the inflation density, households’ expectations are more useful in the upper tail. The predictive ability of measures of inflation expectations is greatest when combined. We show that it is helpful to let the combination weights on different agents’ expectations of inflation vary by quantile when assessing inflationary pressures probabilistically.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2331-distributional-predictive-content-inflation-expectations-measures,23-31,11.30.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,02/26/2024
The nonlinear effects of banks’ vulnerability to capital depletion in euro area countries,"Sharada Nia Davidson, Diego Nicolas Moccero","When capital in the banking system becomes depleted, the degree to which financial intermediation and the macroeconomy are adversely affected is likely to depend on the financial and macroeconomic environment. However, existing studies either assume that the effects of bank capital shocks are linear or ignore feedback effects and the impact on the macroeconomy. Using data on the largest euro area countries and Bayesian Panel Threshold VARs, we investigate the importance of different factors in amplifying shocks in banks’ vulnerability to capital depletion. Our results demonstrate that nonlinearities matter. When the banking sector is already vulnerable to large capital losses, it is more difficult for banks to accommodate a depletion in capital and lending and economic activity contract more severely. Similarly, low interest rates, which are typically associated with low bank margins and profitability, also lead to a larger decline in lending. De-risking is also more pronounced in these cases. The state of the business cycle, though, does not influence the propagation of shocks to the same extent. We conclude that financial factors play a larger role than the macroeconomic environment in heightening shocks to banks’ vulnerability to capital depletion.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2912~509bec90c2.en.pdf?e39d6953f2177134b9ee5c8fa8a61f5c,2912,21 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
"Aggregate uncertainty, HANK, and the ZLB","Alessandro Lin, Marcel Peruffo","We propose a novel methodology for solving Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) models with aggregate uncertainty and the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates. Our efficient solution strategy combines the sequence-state Jacobian methodology in Auclert et al. (2021) with a tractable structure for aggregate uncertainty by means of a two-regimes shock structure. We apply the method to a simple HANK model to show that: 1) in the presence of aggregate non-linearities such as the ZLB, a dichotomy emerges between the aggregate impulse responses under aggregate uncertainty against the deterministic case; 2) aggregate uncertainty amplifies downturns at the ZLB, and household heterogeneity increases the strength of this amplification; 3) the effects of forward guidance are stronger when there is aggregate uncertainty.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2911~5d21f9056f.en.pdf?0584111aa7a3f266d25c74c1b30312e8,2911,21 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
Climate transition risk in the banking sector: what can prudential regulation do?,"Michael Grill, Alexandra Popescu, Elena Rancoita","Climate-related risks are due to increase in coming years and can pose serious threats to financial stability. This paper, by means of a DSGE model including heterogeneous firms and banks, financial frictions and prudential regulation, first shows the need of climate-related capital requirements in the existing prudential framework. Indeed, we find that without specific climate prudential policies, transition risk can generate excessive risk-taking by banks, which in turn increases the volatility of lending and output. We further show that relying on microprudential regulation alone would not be enough to account for the systemic dimension of transition risk. Implementing macroprudential policies in addition to microprudential regulation, leads to a Pareto improvement.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2910~c4d2c82f8c.en.pdf?1975392474c716d6cd62c9c957b2be0d,2910,16 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
Mortgage borrowing limits and house prices: evidence from a policy change in Ireland,Brian E. Higgins,"This paper studies how mortgage borrowers and house prices react to a tightening of mortgage limits following a policy change in Ireland in 2015. The policy introduced limits to the loan-to-income and loan-to-value ratios of new mortgages issued. In response to a tightening borrowing constraint, borrowers can choose to purchase a cheaper house or to reduce the leverage (LTV) of the mortgage. Using a difference-in-difference methodology, I find that groups of (poorer) borrowers, who were more likely to be above the loan-to-income threshold before the policy, responded primarily by buying cheaper houses after the policy change. On the other hand, groups of (richer) borrowers, who were more likely to be above the loan-to-value threshold, responded primarily by reducing the LTV of the mortgage. Borrowers who purchase cheaper houses could be buying smaller houses or the same size houses at a lower equilibrium price. To test for changes in equilibrium prices, I compare prices across postcodes and find that houses prices fell after the policy change in postcodes where a higher fraction of borrowers were above the loan-to-income threshold before the policy.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2909~aac6428413.en.pdf?72adfa705a2bdce62073edadbd33ca76,2909,15 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
Measuring market-based core inflation expectations,"Asger Munch Grønlund, Kasper Jørgensen, Fabian Schupp","We build a novel term structure model for pricing synthetic euro area core inflation-linked swaps, a hypothetical swap contract indexed to core inflation. Our approach relies on a term structure model of traded headline inflation-linked swap rates, which we assume span core inflation. The model provides estimates of market-based expectations for core inflation, as well as core inflation risk premia, at daily frequency, whereas core inflation expectations from surveys or macroeconomic projections are typically only available monthly or quarterly. We find that core inflation-linked swap rates are generally less volatile than headline inflation linked swap rates and that market participants expected core inflation to be substantially more persistent than headline inflation following the 2022 energy price spike. Using an event-study methodology, we also find that monetary policy shocks significantly lower core inflation expectations.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2908~be0bc7b58e.en.pdf?1fd3b3e5d2a07bacbef51dd3b684b5a5,2908,14 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
Managing the transition to central bank digital currency,"Katrin Assenmacher, Massimo Ferrari Minesso, Arnaud Mehl, Maria Sole Pagliari","We develop a two-country DSGE model with financial frictions to study the transition from a steady-state without CBDC to one in which the home country issues a CBDC. The CBDC provides households with a liquid, convenient and storage-cost free means of payments which reduces the market power of banks on deposits. In the steady-state CBDC unambiguously improves welfare without disintermediating the banking sector. But macroeconomic volatility in the transition period to the new steady-state increases for plausible values of the latter. Demand for CBDC and money overshoot, thereby crowding out bank deposits and leading to initial declines in investment, consumption and output. We use non-linear solution methods with occasionally binding constraints to explore how alternative policies reduce volatility in the transition, contrasting the effects of restrictions on non-residents, binding caps, tiered remuneration and central bank asset purchases. Binding caps reduce disintermediation and output losses in the transition most effectively, with an optimal level of around 40% of steady-state CBDC demand.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2907~99a3b6f7cc.en.pdf?ad4e85eae56c3d42d3be772058ff2266,2907,13 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
"Demographics, labor market power and the spatial equilibrium",Nina Furbach,"This paper studies how demographics affect aggregate labor market power, the urban wage premium and the spatial concentration of population. I develop a quantitative spatial model in which labor market competitiveness depends on the demographic composition of the local workforce. Using highly disaggregated administrative data from Germany, I find that firms have more labor market power over older workers: The labor supply elasticity decreases from more than 2 to 1 from age 20 to 64. Calibrating the model with the reduced-form elasticity estimates, I find that differences in labor supply elasticities across age groups can explain 4% of the urban wage premium and 2% of the spatial concentration of population. Demographics and skill together account for 10% of the urban wage premium and 2% of agglomeration.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2906~5da887294e.en.pdf?139d83eb5793c1719af12d7b7d243ab7,2906,12 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
Gas price shocks and euro area inflation,"Jakob Feveile Adolfsen, Massimo Ferrari Minesso, Jente Esther Mork, Ine Van Robays","This paper develops a Bayesian VAR model to identify three structural shocks driving the European gas market: demand, supply and inventory shocks. We document how gas price fluctuations have a heterogeneous pass-through to euro area prices depending on the underlying shock driving them. The pass-through is stronger and more persistent when gas prices are driven by aggregate demand or supply pressures, while inventory shocks have a weaker impact. Supply shocks, moreover, are found to pass through to all components of euro area inflation – producer prices, wages and core inflation, which has implications for monetary policy. We finally document how the response of gas prices to shocks is non-linear and is significantly magnified in periods of low unemployment.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2905~6b246d6bf4.en.pdf?63cb42b272005874a9c7649b5cebd636,2905,12 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
Households' response to the wealth effects of inflation,"Philip Schnorpfeil, Michael Weber, Andreas Hackethal","We study the redistributive effects of surprise inflation combining administrative bank data with an information provision experiment during an episode of historic inflation. On average, households are well-informed about prevailing inflation and are concerned about its impact on their wealth; yet, while many households know about inflation eroding nominal assets, most are unaware of nominal-debt erosion. Once they receive information on the debt-erosion channel, households view nominal debt more positively and increase estimates of their own real net wealth. These changes causally affect actual consumption and hypothetical debt decisions. Our findings suggest that real wealth mediates the sensitivity of consumption to inflation once households are aware of the wealth effects of inflation",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2904~27941cd33f.en.pdf?776183def8a282e91ee6bb36d0805b00,2904,8 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
The macroeconomic effects of global supply chain reorientation,"Daragh Clancy, Donal Smith, Vilém Valenta","Policymakers around the world are encouraging the local production of key inputs to reduce risks from excessive dependencies on foreign suppliers. We analyse the macroeconomic effects of supply chain reorientation through localisation policies, using a global dynamic general equilibrium model. We proxy non-tariff measures, such as the stricter enforcement of regulatory standards, which reduce import quantity but do not directly alter costs and prices. These measures have, so far, been a key component of attempts to reshore production and are an increasingly popular trade policy instrument in general. Focusing on the euro area, we find that localisation policies are inflationary, imply transition costs and generally have a negative long-run effect on aggregate domestic output. The size (and sign) of the impact depends on whether these policies are implemented unilaterally or induce a retaliation from trade partners, and the extent to which they reduce domestic competition and productivity. We provide some recommendations for policymakers considering implementing a localisation agenda.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2903~8bc715c800.en.pdf?8efb3f8dd076fa477fa190805c56946d,2903,8 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
What drives banks’ credit standards? An analysis based on a large bank-firm panel,"Donata Faccia, Franziska Hünnekes, Petra Köhler-Ulbrich","In this paper we build a unique dataset to study how banks decide which firms to lend to and how this decision depends on their own situation and the characteristics of their borrowers. We find that weaker capitalised banks adjust their credit standards more than healthier banks, especially for firms with a higher default risk. We also show how credit standards change in reaction to two specific macroeconomic developments, namely an increase in bank funding costs and a sudden deterioration in banks’ corporate loan portfolios. Here we find that weaker banks respond more forcefully by tightening their credit standards more than better capitalised banks. This development is particularly pronounced when banks are linked to riskier firms. Insofar, we provide evidence of heterogeneity in the bank lending channel, depending on the situation of the lenders and the borrowers.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2902~278590619d.en.pdf?9b8f76f149e250b4951f1e2b197318aa,2902,5 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
The role of comovement and time-varying dynamics in forecasting commodity prices,"Anastasia Allayioti, Fabrizio Venditti","Commodity prices co-move, but the strength of this co-movement changes over time due to structural factors, like changing energy intensity in production and consumption as well as changing composition of underlying shocks. This paper explores whether econometric models that exploit this co-movement and account for parameter instability provide more accurate point and density forecasts of ten major commodity indices viz-a-viz constant coefficient models. Improvements in point forecast accuracy are small, with predictability varying substantially across forecast horizons and commodity indices, but they are large and significant in terms of density forecasting. An economic evaluation reveals that allowing for parameter time variation and commonalities leads to higher portfolios returns, and to higher utility values for investors.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2901~877d1dd5f3.en.pdf?84ca889d1adfc3641a297969f6e6b486,2901,1 February 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
Satellites turn “concrete”: tracking cement with satellite data and neural networks,"Alexandre d’Aspremont, Simon Ben Arous, Jean-Charles Bricongne, Benjamin Lietti, Baptiste Meunier","This paper exploits daily infrared images taken from satellites to track economic activity in advanced and emerging countries. We first develop a framework to read, clean, and exploit satellite images. Our algorithm uses the laws of physics (Planck’s law) and machine learning to detect the heat produced by cement plants in activity. This allows us to monitor in real-time whether a cement plant is working. Using this information on around 500 plants, we construct a satellite-based index tracking activity. We show that using this satellite index outperforms benchmark models and alternative indicators for nowcasting the production of the cement industry as well as the activity in the construction sector. Comparing across methods, we find neural networks yields significantly more accurate predictions as they allow to exploit the granularity of our daily and plant-level data. Overall, we show that combining satellite images and machine learning allows to track economic activity accurately.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2900~8d3e38004d.en.pdf?a0bba7ab4d0d4e1f515dceb4bc52388d,2900,31 January 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
Physical and transition risk premiums in euro area corporate bond markets,"Joost Victor Bats, Giovanna Bua, Daniel Kapp","The European Union plays a prominent role in climate regulations initiatives, this commitment likely implies that climate risk premiums look different in Europe compared to the rest of the world. This paper examines the pricing implications of climate risks in euro area corporate bond markets, focusing on physical and transition risk. Using climate news as a gauge for systematic climate risk, we find a significant pricing effect of physical risk in long-term bonds, with investors demanding higher returns on bonds exposed to physical risk shocks. The estimated physical risk premium is 34 basis points, indicating increased awareness and hedging demand after the Paris Agreement. Transition risk premiums are smaller and less significant, reflecting the ongoing transition to a low-carbon economy. Our findings contribute to understanding climate risk pricing in the European bond markets, highlighting the importance of physical risk and the evolving nature of investor demand for climate-resilient assets.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2899~4710d4cecd.en.pdf?ceb47d4721da0c86982310ce76273bd2,2899,31 January 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
Inflation heterogeneity across households,"Regina Kiss, Georg Strasser","This paper studies the nature, evolution, and sources of inflation heterogeneity across households in France and Germany. Inflation differences are large and persistent. The two main sources of inflation heterogeneity are spatial differences in the prices paid for the same product and differences in the household-specific variety choice within a category. Income heterogeneity by itself is not a relevant determinant of inflation heterogeneity, but due to its correlation with household behaviour, a significant and timevarying inflation difference between income groups emerges. Substitution is strongly behaviour-driven and largely detached from the relative price. The dispersion of the household-level elasticity of substitution does not fully account for the heterogeneity of substitution behaviour. Substitution does not reduce the dispersion of inflation, confirming the central role of preference heterogeneity in inflation measurement.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2898~29405f932f.en.pdf?bfc08f8845c89cad086b956e77f45ddb,2898,30 January 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
The impact of macroeconomic and monetary policy shocks on credit risk in the euro area corporate sector,"Marco Lo Duca, Diego Moccero, Fabio Parlapiano","We analyse the impact of macroeconomic and monetary policy shocks on corporate credit risk as measured by firms’ probabilities of default (PDs) for the four largest euro area countries. We estimate the impact of shocks on one-year PDs using local projections (LP). For the period 2014-19, we find that aggregate shocks significantly affect the dynamics of credit risk. An adverse supply shock leads to a deterioration of firms’ riskiness 10 per cent above the average PD. Contractionary monetary policy shocks exert similar, but delayed effects. Firms’ responses to shocks vary depending on their characteristics and degree of financial constraints. Smaller firms are affected to a larger degree. Firms’ outstanding indebtedness and debt repayment capacity are an important transmission channel for aggregate shocks, but the accumulation of cash reserves helps building resilience.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2897~449ca98c99.en.pdf?f4e4337ea5e33262021b44e35b0d691c,2897,30 January 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
Deposit market concentration and monetary transmission: evidence from the euro area,Stephen Kho,"I study the transmission of monetary policy to deposit rates in the euro area with a focus on asymmetries and the role of banking sector concentration. Using a local projections framework with 2003-2023 country-level and bank-level data for thirteen euro area member states, I find that deposit rates respond symmetrically to an unexpected tightening or easing of monetary policy. However, more concentrated domestic banking sectors do pass-on unexpected monetary tightening (easing) more slowly (quickly) than less concentrated banking sectors, which contributes to a temporary divergence of deposit rates across the euro area. These results suggest that heterogeneity in the degree of banking sector concentration matters for the transmission of monetary policy to deposit rates, which in turn may affect banking sector profitability.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2896~92bba6983d.en.pdf?da4b3ef23e1577b867b9cdc9e463d089,2896,29 January 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
The effect of new housing supply in structural models: a forecasting performance evaluation,Stefan Girstmair,"This paper investigates the importance of including data on new housing supply in Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models in forecasting the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), focusing on the U.S. While existing models have added a financial sector and real estate sector, they have largely overlooked housing supply. I develop an extended DSGE model that includes both the financial sector and endogenous housing supply and show that forecasting accuracy significantly improves when data on new houses is included. Robustness checks confirm the importance of these additions to the model. The findings highlight the necessity of combining model extension and housing supply data for accurate forecasting during economic crises. I identify negative housing demand shocks and escalating adjustment costs as primary drivers of the GFC, propagating into the real economy and accelerating through the financial sector. Additionally, this paper addresses the zero lower bound challenge in modeling forward guidance using a regime change approach.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2895~9c686f3def.en.pdf?a2c223df26c4ef1933424fb428d0d436,2895,29 January 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
Inflation heterogeneity across Austrian households. Evidence from household scanner data,"Teresa Messner, Fabio Rumler","It has been widely documented that households experience different inflation rates which are generally concealed in aggregate price indices. Using scanner data from a large household panel for Austria, we analyse price dynamics faced by individual households and try to explain the causes for the observed inflation differences. Considering not only consumption shares but also the specific product prices paid by households, we find a considerable and persistent degree of heterogeneity among household inflation rates. These are also quite variable over time, resulting from varying consumption baskets and active product substitution, allowing households to reduce their inflation exposure substantially. Factors like age and shopping behavior of households explain some of the inflation differences, whereas income does not seem to have a notable influence in normal times. However, during high inflation periods, the lowest income group is found to face higher inflation rates than other income groups.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2894~5fd5d33b3f.en.pdf?4214c17872b1be632a7ea1a6ef6552fc,2894,26 January 2024,ECB,02/26/2024
